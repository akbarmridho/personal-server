# Module 4: Trade Execution & Risk Management

**Description:** A consolidated framework for entering trades, managing positions, taking profits, and controlling risk based on proven technical principles.

## 4.1 Entry Strategies

Entry is not about predicting the absolute bottom, but confirming the start of a move. We use three primary entry mechanisms derived from our core philosophies.

### A. Trend Following Breakout

*Best for: Stocks starting a new mark-up phase.*

* **Philosophy:** Buy strength. Wait for the market to prove the trend.
* **Trigger:** Price breaks **above** key resistance or Moving Averages (MA5, MA10, MA20) and establishes a position above them.
* **Volume Requirement:** Must be accompanied by a **significant volume spike** (often >70% of daily avg in first hour). This indicates "smart money" participation.

### B. Pullback to Value

*Best for: Stocks already in an uptrend offering a secondary entry.*

* **Philosophy:** Buy at demand areas to improve risk/reward.
* **Location:**
  * **Support Zones:** Previous resistance turned support.
  * **Fibonacci Levels:** 38.2%, 50%, or 61.8% retracement levels.
  * **Dynamic MA:** Price tests the specific MA respecting the trend (e.g., MA20).
* **Confirmation:** Price stabilizes at the level. Bounces should see volume picked up.

### C. The Wyckoff Spring (Reversal)

*Best for: Catching the end of accumulation/sideways phases.*

* **Philosophy:** Buy the "shakeout" where weak hands are forced out before the move.
* **Pattern:**
    1. Price breaks *below* a support level.
    2. **Volume is LOW** on the break (no real supply).
    3. Price quickly recovers back above support.
* **Trigger:** Entry on the recovery back inside the range.

## 4.2 Volume Confirmation Rules Matrix

Volume is the "fuel" of any move. Use this matrix to validate price action:

| Price Action | Volume | Interpretation | Action |
| --- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Price **UP** | Volume **UP** | Strong Trend (Markup) | **Hold / Buy** |
| Price **DOWN** | Volume **DOWN** | Healthy Correction | **Hold / Buy Dip** |
| Price **UP** | Volume **DOWN** | Weak Rally | **Caution** |
| Price **DOWN** | Volume **UP** | Distribution | **EXIT** |

**The Anomaly Rule:**
If a stock trades **70% of its average daily volume** within the first hour, a major move (breakout or dump) is imminent. Transition to active monitoring.

## 4.3 Position Sizing & Scaling

We do not gamble; we allocate capital based on conviction and risk rules.

### The 1% Risk Rule

Never risk more than **1% of total capital** on a single trade.

**Calculation:**
$$
\text{Position Size (Lots)} = \frac{\text{Total Capital} \times 1\%}{\text{Entry Price} - \text{Stop Loss}}
$$

* *Example:* Capital 100M. Risk 1M. Entry 1,000. Stop 950 (Risk 50/share).
  * Size = 1,000,000 / 50 = 20,000 shares (200 lots).

### Scaling In (The Pyramid)

Do not go "All-In" immediately unless the setup is pristine.

1. **Initial Entry:** 30-70% of max position size depending on conviction.
2. **Average Up:** Add to the position (Pyramiding) only when the thesis is confirmed (e.g., breakout holds, trend continues).
    * *Note:* Avoid averaging down on losers. Average up on winners.

## 4.4 Exit Strategies

The goal is to capture the "body" of the trend. We accept giving back the top 5-10% to ensure we don't sell too early.

### A. The Structural Exit (Trend Following)

*Primary method for big trends.*

* **Trigger:** Price closes **below** the Dynamic MA (support) **AND** breaks the uptrend line.
* **Discipline:** Do not sell just because the price "feels high" or RSI is overbought. As long as price > Dynamic MA, the trend is intact.

### B. Resistance & Extension Targets

*For swing trades or defined ranges.*

* **Targets:** Major resistance zones (Supply Areas) or Fibonacci Extensions (161.8%).
* **Action:** Sell partials (e.g., 50%) at resistance to lock in gains, let the rest run with a trailing stop.

### C. Volume-Based Escape (Emergency)

*Immediate exit signals.*

* **Breakdown:** Support breaks with **HIGH Volume**. (Real supply entering).
* **Climax:** Massive volume spike without price progress (Churning/Distribution) after a long rally.

## 4.5 The "No Resistance" Phase

When a stock breaks All-Time Highs (ATH) or clears all major resistance:

1. **Do NOT guess a target.** There is no overhead supply.
2. **Hold** until the trend structure breaks (Dynamic MA violation).
3. Ignore "Overvalued" commentary; price discovery is in effect.

## Summary Checklist

**Before Entry:**

* [ ] Is the trend confirmed (Price > MA)?
* [ ] Is there a Volume Anomaly or smart money footprint?
* [ ] Have I calculated the max loss (1% rule)?
* [ ] Am I buying a breakout (Strength) or a valid support bounce (Value)?

**During Trade:**

* [ ] Is Price > Dynamic MA? -> HOLD.
* [ ] Is Price correction on Low Volume? -> HOLD.
* [ ] Did Price break support/MA on High Volume? -> EXIT.
