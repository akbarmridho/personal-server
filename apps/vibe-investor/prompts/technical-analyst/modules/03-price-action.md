# Module 3: Price Action & Patterns

**Description:** Recognizing market phases using Wyckoff methodology, analyzing price-volume relationships, and distinguishing real breakouts from fake breakouts (traps).

## 3.1 Price-Volume Relationship Rules (Wyckoff Logic)

While indicators provide secondary signals, the primary data remains changes in **Price** and **Volume**.

### The Up Trend Formula

In a healthy bullish environment, the interaction follows two primary rules:

| Price Action | Volume Action | Interpretation | Action |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Price **↑** | Volume **↑** | **Strong Up Trend** - Markup supported by massive demand | Hold / Buy |
| Price **↓** | Volume **↓** | **Up Trend Continuation** - Healthy correction, smart money NOT exiting | Hold / Buy Dip |
| Price **↑** | Volume **↓** | **Weak Rally** - Lack of conviction, potential reversal | Caution |
| Price **↓** | Volume **↑** | **Distribution** - Smart money exiting, trend likely ending | EXIT |

### Key Insight

A price drop on **low volume** suggests a "healthy correction." It indicates that while some profit-taking is occurring, the major holders are not exiting their positions.

## 3.2 Volume Anomaly Detection

### The 70% Volume Rule

For active traders, if a stock reaches **70% of its average daily volume within the first hour of trading**, it is a high-probability signal that a major move (either a breakout or a massive dump) is occurring.

### Detecting "Seeds" of Momentum

When volume suddenly spikes in a stock that was previously dormant—reaching perhaps 70% of its average daily turnover within the first hour—it signals an anomaly that cannot be ignored.

**Action:** When a usually quiet stock suddenly trades with high aggression, transition from observation to active monitoring.

## 3.3 Detecting Accumulation (Frequency Analyzer)

When a stock is **sideways for extended period** and shows unusual activity (frequency spikes) over days/weeks, it indicates accumulation by big money.

### Conditions for Valid Signal

1. Price must be sideways (consolidation/range)
2. Stock must be relatively quiet/illiquid before
3. Unusual activity persists for days/weeks (not just one day)
4. Confirm with broker summary if available (Indonesia market)

### What to Look For

- Volume spikes during sideways price action
- Increasing number of transactions without price movement
- This often precedes markup phase

## 3.4 Wyckoff Accumulation Schematic

The transition from downtrend to uptrend follows specific phases.

### Phase A: Stopping the Downtrend

| Event | Description | Volume |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Preliminary Support (PS)** | Large buyers step in, first resistance to downtrend | Increasing |
| **Selling Climax (SC)** | Panic selling, massive volume spike on wide down candle | Massive spike |
| **Automatic Rally (AR)** | Exhaustion of selling allows easy bounce, defines upper range | Decreasing |
| **Secondary Test (ST)** | Price returns to SC area to test if supply is exhausted | **Much lower than SC** |

### Phase B: Building the Cause

- Longest phase
- Price oscillates in range
- Institutions absorb remaining supply
- Frustrates retail traders (they exit)
- Goal: "wash out" weak hands

### Phase C: The Test (Spring)

- Deliberate break below support ("Spring")
- Tests if selling pressure remains
- Volume stays low on the break
- Price quickly recovers
- **This is the final shakeout before markup**

### Confirmation

Spring is valid when:

- Support breaks on **LOW volume**
- Price quickly recovers above support
- Followed by markup on **increasing volume**

## 3.5 Identifying the Selling Climax

A Selling Climax marks potential trend reversal from down to up.

### Anatomy of a Bottom

1. **Saturation of bad news** - Company bombarded with negative reports
2. **Price stability** - Despite bad news, price stops making new lows
3. **Volume anomaly** - High volume appears without price dropping (absorption)
4. **Confirmation** - Price breaks downward structure on high volume, then corrects on LOW volume

### The "Bad News is Good" Principle

When stock is hit with negative news but:

- Experiences high-volume drop
- Then moves sideways
- Price refuses to drop further

→ Supply has been absorbed. Bad news is "priced in." Stock is primed for reversal.

## 3.6 Breakout Patterns

### Valid Breakout Characteristics

1. Price closes above resistance (not just wick)
2. Volume significantly above average (1.5x+)
3. Follow-through in subsequent days
4. Previous resistance becomes support on retest

### Breakout Entry Options

| Method | Description | Risk |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Aggressive | Enter on breakout candle close | Higher (fake break risk) |
| Conservative | Wait for retest of broken level | Lower (may miss move) |

## 3.7 Fake Breakout (Fakeout) Detection

Market makers use fake breakouts to trap retail traders.

### The Trap Mechanism

1. **The Setup:** Well-known resistance level, retail watching
2. **The Fake Break:** Price pushed above resistance to trigger retail buy orders
3. **The Reversal:** Once retail buys in, price dumps back below resistance
4. **The Result:** Retail trapped at highs, becomes supply for further decline

### How to Detect Fake Breaks

| Signal | Real Breakout | Fake Breakout |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Volume | High (1.5x+ average) | Low or normal |
| Candle close | Strong close above level | Wick above, close below |
| Follow-through | Next day holds above | Immediately reverses |
| Retest behavior | Holds broken level as support | Falls back through |

### The Volume Confirmation Rule

**CRITICAL:** Always check volume on level breaks.

| Break | Volume | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|--------|----------------|--------|
| Support breaks | LOW volume | Likely fake (manipulation) | Wait, possibly buy the dip |
| Support breaks | HIGH volume + heavy offer | Valid breakdown | Exit mandatory |
| Resistance breaks | LOW volume | Likely fake | Don't chase |
| Resistance breaks | HIGH volume | Valid breakout | Enter or hold |

## Summary

| Pattern | Key Signal | Volume |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Selling Climax | Massive down candle at lows | Extreme spike |
| Secondary Test | Retest of lows | Much lower than SC |
| Spring | Fake break below support | Low volume, quick recovery |
| Valid Breakout | Close above resistance | High volume (1.5x+) |
| Fake Breakout | Wick above, close below | Low or normal volume |
| Distribution | Price up/sideways at highs | High volume, no progress |
