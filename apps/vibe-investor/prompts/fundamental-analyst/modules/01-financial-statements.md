# Financial Statement Analysis Framework

This module provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the quality of a company's financial health. It combines standard accounting checks with "value investor" perspectives to distinguish between accounting anomalies and true business performance.

## 1. Balance Sheet Checklist: Structure & Solvency

### Asset Alignment & Business Model

- **Investor vs. Accountant View:** Re-categorize assets to reflect the business model. Split assets into **Working Capital** (cash, receivables, inventory) and **Fixed Assets** (infrastructure).
- **Industry Consistency:**
  - **Heavy Industry (e.g., Coal Mining):** Should show high Fixed Assets (infrastructure).
  - **Financial/Service (e.g., Banks):** Should show high Working Capital (money flow).
  - *Red Flag:* Significant misalignment between asset allocation and the specific industry requirements.

### Liquidity & Quality

- **Current Ratio Check:** Flag if Current Assets < Current Liabilities.
- **Quick Ratio Check:** Flag if Quick Ratio < 0.5 (conservative liquidity assessment).
- **Asset Quality:**
  - **Inventory Control:** Percentage increase in inventory should be lower than profit growth (%Δ Inventory < Profit Growth).
  - **Other Assets Limit:** "Other Assets" (Aset Lain-lain) should not exceed 5% of Total Assets.

### Debt Composition & Equity

- **Debt Classification:** Not all debt is equal. Distinguish between:
  - **Business Payables:** Interest-free credit from suppliers (Good debt indicating bargaining power).
  - **Business Loans:** Interest-bearing debt (Bad debt if excessive).
  - *Insight:* A high DER may be acceptable if primarily composed of business payables.
- **Equity Source:** Verify if equity growth is driven by **Accumulated Profits** (Organic) or **Capital Injections** (Rights Issues/Private Placements).

## 2. Income Statement Checklist: True Earnings

### Revenue & Segment Analysis

- **Source Verification:** Analyze **Footnotes** to break down revenue by segment. Ensure the "Main Business" is the primary revenue driver, not unrelated side ventures.
- **Commodity Sensitivity:** Identify if the company is a beneficiary or victim of raw material price hikes (e.g., coal price hike benefits miners but hurts cement companies due to rising COGS).

### Efficiency, Costs & Margins

- **COGS Structure:**
  - **Fixed Costs:** Depreciation/Factory overhead (constant regardless of sales).
  - **Variable Costs:** Raw materials (scales with volume).
  - *Warning:* Rising COGS with stagnant revenue suggests inefficiency or inability to pass costs to consumers.
- **Margin vs. Turnover:**
  - **Luxury/Property:** High Margin, Low Turnover.
  - **Retail/Consumer Goods:** Low Margin, High Turnover.
- **SGA Efficiency:**
  - **Marketing:** High ad spend must correlate with revenue growth.
  - **General/Admin:** Monitor head office costs to prevent management wastefulness.

### Earnings Quality

- **The "Other Income" Trap:**
  - Exclude one-time events (asset sales, divestitures) from long-term valuation.
  - Ignore FX Gains/Losses as they are often "virtual" or temporary.
- **Profitability Floor:** Net Profit Margin (NPM) should be greater than 2%.

## 3. Cash Flow Statement Checklist: The "Blood" of the Business

### Cash Flow vs. Accounting Profit

- **Reality Check:** Accounting profit is an opinion; Cash is a fact. High accounting profits must be validated by high **Operating Cash Flows**.
- **Value Trap Avoidance:** Discrepancies between Net Income and Operating Cash Flow indicate "Paper Profits" rather than actual liquidity.

### Solvency & Sustainability

- **Repayment Capacity:** It should not take more than 10 years to pay off total debt using operating cash flow.
- **Cash Flow to Debt Ratio:** OCF/Total Debt < 0.1 is a potential warning sign.
- **Source of Cash:** Cash flow increases should originate from core business operations, not from capital injections (share issuance) or increased borrowing.

### Shareholder Value

- **Dividend Coverage:** Dividends paid should not exceed Free Cash Flow (FCF).
- **Dilution:** Avoid companies that are overly aggressive with Stock-Based Compensation (SBC).

## 4. Advanced Ratios & Integrity Checks

### Solvency & Risk

- **Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR)**: Operating Profit / Interest Expense
  - < 1.0: DANGER. Cannot pay interest from profits.
  - > 3.0: Safe.
- **Net Gearing Ratio (NGR)**: (Interest Bearing Debt - Cash) / Equity
  - < 0.5 (50%): Ideal.

### Valuation Double-Checks

- **Earnings Yield**: EPS / Price
  - Compare with Gov Bond Yield. If Earnings Yield < Bond Yield, stock is expensive (risk premium check).
- **EV/EBITDA**: Enterprise Value / EBITDA
  - < 10x: Generally considered cheap/undervalued.
  - Better than P/E for comparing companies with different debt levels.

## 5. Multi-Period Trend Analysis

When analyzing financial statements, always compare across multiple periods:

- **Minimum 3 years** for trend identification
- **5-10 years** for cyclical business assessment
- **Quarter-over-quarter** for recent momentum

### What to Track Over Time

- Revenue growth trajectory (accelerating, decelerating, declining)
- Margin trends (expanding, stable, compressing)
- ROE consistency (stable >10% = quality indicator)
- Cash conversion (OCF/Net Profit ratio over time)
- Debt trajectory (increasing or decreasing leverage)
- Dividend payout sustainability

### Key Formulas

- **Current Ratio:** Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- **Net Profit Margin:** (Net Income / Revenue) × 100%
- **Cash Flow to Debt:** Operating Cash Flow / Total Debt
- **Free Cash Flow:** Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditure
- **DER:** Total Debt / Total Equity
