# Company Quality Assessment

This module provides frameworks for evaluating business quality, competitive advantages, ownership structure, and growth prospects.

## 1. Business Model Understanding

Before any analysis, answer these fundamental questions:

- What does the company actually do?
- How does the company make money?
- What are the main revenue segments?
- Who are the customers? Who are the suppliers?
- What is the competitive landscape?

### Basic Filters

- **Company existence**: Does the company actually exist and operate today?
- **Bankruptcy risk**: Could the company realistically go bankrupt? (check Altman Z-score)
  - Z > 3.0 (Safe Zone): Financially healthy, low bankruptcy risk
  - Z 1.8-3.0 (Grey Zone): Caution needed, warning signs appearing
  - Z < 1.8 (Distress Zone): High probability of bankruptcy
- **Future prospects**: Does the company have a long-term future?
- **Business growth**: Is the business still growing?

## 2. Economic Moat Framework

An "Economic Moat" refers to a company's sustainable competitive advantage that protects its long-term profits and market share from competitors.

### Sources of Economic Moat

**Intangible Assets** - Companies with strong intangible assets can command premium pricing.

- Brand Equity: Strong brand recognition creates customer loyalty (e.g., Aqua, Indomie)
- Patents: Legal protection for proprietary technology
- Exclusive Licenses: Government-granted monopolies or exclusivity (e.g., Astra/Toyota distribution)

**Network Effect** - Value increases as more users join, creating self-reinforcing cycles.

- Vast distribution or user network makes service more valuable
- Competitors struggle to replicate the network
- Examples: Indomaret/Alfamart (distribution), Tokopedia (marketplace)

**Switching Costs** - High costs discourage customers from moving to competitors.

- Financial switching costs (fees, penalties)
- Time/effort switching costs (learning new systems)
- Data/integration switching costs (migrating information)
- Examples: Banking services, enterprise software

**Barriers to Entry** - Structural obstacles preventing new challengers.

- Regulatory Hurdles: Licenses, permits, compliance
- Technology Requirements: Advanced R&D, specialized expertise
- Capital Requirements: Massive upfront investment
- Scale Advantages: Existing players have cost advantages from volume
- Examples: Banking (capital), Mining (permits + infrastructure)

### Financial Indicators of a Moat

- Positive Free Cash Flow for at least 5 consecutive years
- ROE consistently above 10%
- Gross Profit Margin maintained above 40%
- Stable or growing market share over 5+ years
- Pricing power: Ability to raise prices without losing customers
- Low customer concentration: Not dependent on few large customers

### Moat Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Does the company have strong brands, patents, or licenses?
- [ ] Does the value increase as more users join?
- [ ] Are customers locked in (switching costs)?
- [ ] Can new competitors easily replicate the business?
- [ ] FCF positive for 5+ years?
- [ ] ROE consistently >10%?
- [ ] GPM consistently >40%?
- [ ] Market share stable or growing?

### Moat Erosion Warning Signs

- Declining market share despite stable industry
- Margin compression over multiple periods
- New technology disrupting the industry
- Regulatory changes reducing barriers
- Customer concentration increasing
- Increased competition from well-funded entrants

## 3. Industry Lifecycle & Market Structure

### Industry Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Characteristics | Investment Approach |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Introduction | New product, high risk, no track record | Speculative, small positions |
| Growth | Rapid expansion, increasing competition | Focus on market leaders |
| Maturity | Slowing growth, stable competition, consistent profits | Efficiency leaders, dividend yield |
| Decline | Shrinking market, consolidation, value traps common | Avoid or short-term tactical only |

### Market Structure (Pricing Power)

| Structure | Pricing Power | Barriers | Investor View |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| Monopoly | Maximum (price setter) | Very high | Ideal long-term (e.g., PLN, Telkom legacy) |
| Oligopoly | High (coordination possible) | High | Highly attractive for leaders (e.g., BBCA, SMGR) |
| Monopolistic Competition | Moderate (differentiation) | Medium | Focus on strongest brands |
| Perfect Competition | None (price takers) | Low | Thin margins, generally avoid |

## 4. Ownership Structure Analysis

### Shareholding Structure

- Is there a clear controlling shareholder or parent company?
- What is the free float percentage?
- Is the stock held by large institutional investors?
- Is it held by foreign investors? (flow implications in IDX 2.0)
- Any recent changes in major shareholders?

### Owner & Major Shareholder Character

Evaluate the character of the owner and majority shareholders:

- **Goals**: What are the owners' goals? Growth? Cash extraction?
- **Dividend philosophy**: Do they routinely share profits via dividends?
- **Capital raising patterns**: Do they often raise money from public (rights issues, REPO)?
- **Ambition assessment**: Do they have ambition to become ultra-rich at all costs?
- **Track record**: How have they treated minority shareholders historically?

## 5. Management Quality Assessment

### Governance Indicators

- Board independence and diversity
- Executive compensation relative to performance
- Related party transaction history
- Capital allocation track record
- Communication transparency with investors

### Management Red Flags

- Frequent management turnover
- Excessive related party transactions
- Management compensation growing faster than profits
- Poor capital allocation (destroying value through bad acquisitions)
- Lack of skin in the game (low insider ownership)

## 6. Business Excitement & Growth Story

### Growth Assessment

- Is the business still exciting for the future?
- Are there new things in the business that can attract investor imagination?
- Are there still many opportunities for expansion and new profit?
- Is the company in a growing or shrinking addressable market?

### Re-rating Potential

Some companies are profitable but not exciting (e.g., mature food companies), so they are harder for the market to "pump" or re-rate aggressively. Consider:

- Is there a catalyst for market re-rating?
- Can the company's story attract new investor interest?
- Is the company transitioning to a higher-growth segment?

## 7. Future Existence & Quality

Ask these forward-looking questions:

- Will the company likely still operate in the future?
- Will it likely still be profitable?
- Will it likely continue paying dividends?
- Is it still worth holding for long-term investors?
- What could disrupt the business model?
