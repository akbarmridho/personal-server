# Catalyst Mapping Framework

## Catalyst Calendar

Map known and potential catalysts with expected timing.

| Catalyst type | Typical timing | Typical impact |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Quarterly earnings | ~30-45 days post quarter | Beat/miss, guidance change |
| Annual report | Q1 following year | Full-year quality and payout context |
| RUPS | Q2-Q3 | Dividend approval, board and strategic agenda |
| LQ45/IDX rebalancing | Feb and Aug | Forced buying/selling windows |
| MSCI rebalancing | Feb, May, Aug, Nov | Foreign fund-flow catalyst |
| Regulatory decisions | Variable | Licensing/policy/tariff repricing |
| Commodity triggers | Ongoing | Price pass-through to earnings narrative |
| Corporate actions | As announced | Rights issue, split, M&A, spin-off |
| IPO lock-up expiry | 6-12 months post IPO | Supply overhang risk |
| Debt maturity | Company specific | Refinancing/liquidity stress event |

## Catalyst Proximity Rule

- <1 month: imminent, often partially pre-positioned.
- 1-3 months: best setup window if narrative is still under-owned.
- >6 months: story can stale or be displaced by new narratives.
