# Hype Lifecycle: From “Pompom” to “Cuci Piring”

This is a reference model for **how stories turn into liquidity**, then into bagholders.

## Phases (reference)

| Phase | What it looks like | Who benefits |
|---|---|---|
| **Accumulation** | Quiet; boring; limited attention; supply consolidates | Strong hands |
| **Pompom** (leak/endorsement) | Influencers/media push story; attention ramps | Strong hands (prep liquidity) |
| **Frying / Markup** | Fast price expansion; “everyone posting gains” | Strong hands + early followers |
| **Cuci piring** (dish-washing) | Crowd holds; price fades; liquidity dries | Late entrants lose |

## Influencer/template red flags

Higher probability you are late-stage when:

- multiple accounts share **near-identical** “templates” (same slides/bullets)
- the narrative is simple, viral, and detached from numbers
- the stock is already up large before the campaign intensifies

## Weekly–monthly use

Treat this as a **cycle-positioning map**:

- early-phase: focus on ownership/SID contraction (cleaning),
- late-phase: focus on “who is buying” + whether SID is expanding.
