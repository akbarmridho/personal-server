# Narrative Valuation (IDX) — Reference

This entry is a compact reference for thinking about **how much “story” is priced**, and when narrative becomes too expensive.

## Decompose price into two layers

| Layer | What it represents | Typical evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Base value** | What the business is worth without “special events” | Normalized earnings/cash flow, peer multiples |
| **Narrative premium** | Extra price paid for a future story/catalyst | Re-rating, future optionality, forced-buyer events |

## Certainty becomes expensive

IDX narratives often follow this curve:

| Narrative state | Market behavior |
|---|---|
| Uncertain / not believed | Cheap but volatile, easy to doubt |
| Becoming plausible | Re-rating starts; best R/R often here |
| Consensus / “everyone knows” | Most expensive; downside asymmetry grows |

## Catalyst “priced-in” tests (reference)

| Test | If “yes”, risk is higher |
|---|---|
| If the catalyst happens exactly as expected, will price still go up materially? | Narrative may be fully priced |
| Is the story now official + repeated everywhere? | Late-stage/exit-liquidity risk rises |
| Is participation/crowding expanding (SID/retail attention)? | Liquidity used for distribution |

## IDX-specific catalyst classes (where premium comes from)

| Catalyst class | Why premium appears |
|---|---|
| Index agenda (MSCI/LQ45) | Forced buyers / liquidity windows |
| Corporate actions (RI, M&A, backdoor) | Repricing via structure and control changes |
| Macro rotation (SoV/commodities) | Cross-sector money flow narratives |
