# Workflow And Operating Sequence

## Phase 1: Parallel Data Collection

Run in parallel:

- `search-documents` for symbol and key themes
- `search-twitter` for current social spread
- `get-stock-fundamental` for valuation framing
- `get-stock-governance` for owner and control context

## Phase 2: Sequential Analysis

1. Narrative identification
2. Catalyst mapping
3. Narrative strength scoring
4. Failure-mode assessment
5. Haluasi / narrative-premium assessment (if relevant)

## Phase 3: Verdict

Produce one of:

- `STRONG`
- `MODERATE`
- `WEAK`
- `BROKEN`

Verdict must include:

- Key story in 1-2 sentences
- Catalyst timeline
- Primary failure trigger
- Confidence level
