# Haluasi & Re-rating Premium (IDX) — Reference

“Haluasi” (hallucination premium) is the market paying for **imagination** beyond base fundamentals. It is not “always bad”; it is a **pricing regime**.

## When haluasi premium forms

| Driver | Why it works on IDX |
|---|---|
| **Scarcity** | Limited investable proxies amplify pricing |
| **Simplicity** | One-sentence story spreads faster |
| **Forced buyers** | Index/mandate flows create liquidity windows |
| **Control/agenda** | Controlling shareholders can engineer supply/liquidity |

## Premium bands (reference)

| Premium band | Typical behavior | Failure risk |
|---|---|---|
| Moderate | Re-rating is “explainable” | Softer mean reversion |
| High | Narrative dominates numbers | -30% to -50% drawdown common on breaks |
| Extreme | Pure imagination + crowding | -50% to -80% tail risk |

## Practical failure triggers (reference)

| Trigger | Why it breaks premium |
|---|---|
| Narrative becomes stale/consensus | No incremental buyers |
| Policy/regulation blocks the catalyst | Premium collapses into base value |
| Ownership/crowding expands at highs | Exit liquidity created for stronger hands |
