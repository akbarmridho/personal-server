# WTFF Backdoor Cycle (IDX) — Reference

Mentorbaik jargon frames backdoor mania as a **cycle artifact** that often clusters near late-stage markets.

## Terms (local jargon)

| Term | Practical meaning |
|---|---|
| **TFF** | Early-stage narrative ignition (market getting “hot”) |
| **WTFF** | Amplified late-stage narrative frenzy |
| **Peaked** | Late-cycle conditions where exit-liquidity events cluster |

## Why backdoor themes cluster late-cycle (heuristic)

Backdoor/corporate-action mania tends to intensify when:

- speculative appetite is high,
- “real economy support” feels weak but price action is strong,
- liquidity seeks high-beta, high-story vehicles.

## Indonesia-specific pre-signals (reference)

| Signal | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Shell scarcity + rising “shell price”** | Late-cycle: easy shells already used, remaining shells reprice |
| **Warkat → scriptless conversion** by controlling holders | Prepares tradability/transfer; watch KSEI ownership context |
| PSP/control moves become more visible | Indicates agenda execution is near |
