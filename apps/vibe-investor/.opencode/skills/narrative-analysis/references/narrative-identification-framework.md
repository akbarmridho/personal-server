# Narrative Identification Framework

## Step 1: Business Reality Check

Before story analysis, confirm business viability.

| Question | Red flag if |
|----------|-------------|
| Does business actually operate? | Shell with no real operations |
| Bankruptcy risk manageable? | Altman Z-score < 1.8 |
| Long-term relevance intact? | Obsolete product, shrinking market |
| Revenue trajectory healthy? | Multi-year decline without recovery plan |
| Revenue model clear? | Unclear monetization, paper-profit profile |

## Step 2: Classify Narrative Type

| Type | Description | Typical examples |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Thematic play | Riding macro/sector theme | EV chain, data center, energy transition |
| Earnings turnaround | Recovery from weak base | Margin expansion, debt reduction |
| Corporate action | Structural event | M&A, spin-off, rights issue |
| Sector rotation | Capital rotation across sectors | Rate-cut beneficiaries, commodities |
| Policy beneficiary | Regulation-driven uplift | Incentives, tariff changes |
| MSCI/index inclusion | Forced-buying narrative | MSCI review, LQ45 inclusion |
| Conglomerate rerating | Group restructuring story | Asset spin-off, strategic pivot |
| Dividend play | Payout-driven demand | High/special dividend cycle |
| Speculative/hype | Story-first, weak numbers | Viral influencer campaign |

## Step 3: Growth Excitement Test

- Is there future optionality the market can imagine?
- Is there expansion logic beyond stable status quo?
- Mature but stable names can still work, but rerating velocity is usually lower.

## Step 4: Owner Character Assessment

| Question | Bullish signal | Bearish signal |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Owner objective | Long-term value build | Cash extraction behavior |
| Dividend policy | Consistent and rational | Persistently low payout despite profits |
| Fundraising behavior | Rare and purpose-driven | Repeated dilutive actions |
| Minority alignment | Transparent and fair | Aggressive control-first behavior |

## Step 5: Ownership Map

| Check | Signal |
|------|--------|
| Institutional holders | Validation and stability |
| Foreign presence | External confidence signal |
| Control clarity | Strategic direction visibility |
| Recent ownership shifts | Possible narrative regime change |
