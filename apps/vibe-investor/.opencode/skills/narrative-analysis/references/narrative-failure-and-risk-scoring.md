# Narrative Failure And Risk Scoring

## What Breaks The Story

| Narrative type | Typical failure trigger |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Thematic play | Theme fades or demand assumptions fail |
| Earnings turnaround | Next earnings disconfirm recovery |
| Corporate action | Deal canceled/blocked or terms worsen |
| Sector rotation | Macro regime shifts against the sector |
| Policy beneficiary | Policy delayed/reversed/weaker than expected |
| MSCI/index | Inclusion fails or expected flow does not materialize |
| Conglomerate rerating | Strategic pivot execution breaks |
| Dividend play | Payout below expectations |
| Speculative/hype | No real business follow-through |

## Failure Risk Score (0-3)

| Score | Level | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Low | Multiple independent catalysts, resilient thesis |
| 1 | Moderate | 2-3 dependencies with partial redundancy |
| 2 | High | Single-key catalyst, binary setup |
| 3 | Critical | Visible cracks, narrative already degrading |

## Price Behavior vs Narrative Health

| Price behavior | Narrative state | Reading |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Price up + narrative fresh | Healthy | Normal markup |
| Price flat + narrative fresh | Early skepticism/positioning | Needs confirmation |
| Price up + narrative aging | Late stage | De-risking candidate |
| Price down + narrative intact | Either opportunity or early failure | Validate with evidence |
| Price down + narrative broken | Confirmed failure | Exit/avoid |

## Failure Discipline

- Define invalidation before acting.
- If primary invalidation hits, downgrade verdict immediately.
- Do not rely on social momentum after fundamental or governance failure.
