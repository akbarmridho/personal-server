# Narrative Strength And Priced-In Tests

## Strength Scoring Matrix (0-15)

| Factor | Score | Criteria |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Freshness | 0-3 | 0 stale, 3 brand new |
| Market awareness | 0-3 | 0 everyone knows, 3 under-owned |
| Fundamental support | 0-3 | 0 pure hype, 3 strong evidence |
| Catalyst proximity | 0-3 | 0 none, 3 imminent (<1 month) |
| Flow alignment | 0-3 | 0 visible distribution, 3 clear accumulation |

## Interpretation

| Score | Verdict | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 12-15 | STRONG | Fresh, supported, catalyst-active |
| 8-11 | MODERATE | Real story but partially priced/delayed catalyst |
| 4-7 | WEAK | Stale or weakly supported narrative |
| 0-3 | BROKEN | No credible narrative edge |

## Priced-In Detection

A story is likely priced in when:

- Price already repriced materially ahead of catalyst.
- Social discussion is saturated.
- Research notes already consensus the same thesis.
- Valuation already embeds expected catalyst outcome.

Core test:

- If catalyst happens exactly as expected, is there still material upside?
- If no, upside asymmetry is weak.
