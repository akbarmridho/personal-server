# Sharia Banking Framework

Sharia banking operates under Islamic law — prohibits interest, focuses on risk-sharing and real-asset-backed transactions.

## Core Prohibitions

| Prohibition | Definition | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Riba** (Interest) | Predetermined interest on loans | Profit must come from trade/services, not lending money |
| **Gharar** (Uncertainty) | Excessive ambiguity or hidden information | Highly speculative transactions |
| **Maysir** (Gambling) | Profit from pure chance | Speculative forex trading |

## Transaction Contracts (Akad)

### Fixed Margin (Trade & Lease)

| Contract | Mechanism | Revenue Source |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Murabahah** (Cost-Plus Sale) | Bank buys asset, sells to customer at agreed markup. Customer pays installments. | Fixed margin on sale |
| **Ijarah** (Leasing) | Bank buys asset, rents to customer | Rental margin |

### Variable Margin (Profit & Loss Sharing)

| Contract | Mechanism | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **Mudharabah** | Bank manages customer capital. Profits shared per agreed ratio (PSR). | If investment misses target: bank gets no fee, customer bears financial loss |
| **Musyarakah** (Joint Venture) | Both bank and customer provide capital | Profits/losses shared proportionally to capital contribution |

### Social Lending

- **Qardh**: Interest-free loan for social purposes (e.g., medical). Customer repays principal + small admin fee only.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Conventional Equivalent | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|------------------------|---------|-----------|
| **FDR** (Financing to Deposit Ratio) | LDR | Total Financing / Total DPK | Ideal: 90-100% |
| **NPF** (Non-Performing Financing) | NPL | Problematic Financing / Total Financing | Healthy: <5%; Ideal: <3% |
| **PSR** (Profit Sharing Ratio) | — | Profit Shared to Customers / Total Profit | >40% = attractive to depositors but may lower bank profitability |

## Governance

- Every sharia bank overseen by **DPS (Dewan Pengawas Syariah)** — Sharia Supervisory Board
- DPS ensures compliance with rulings (fatwas) of **DSN-MUI** (National Sharia Council)

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **Large**: BRIS (Bank Syariah Indonesia — merged BSI)
- **Digital Sharia**: BANK (Bank Aladin Syariah)
- **Sharia Units**: Most Big 4 banks operate sharia subsidiaries/units
