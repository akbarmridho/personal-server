# Coal Sector Framework

Indonesia is a top global coal exporter. The sector spans exploration through reclamation, with profitability driven by strip ratio, coal quality, and global pricing benchmarks.

## Value Chain

1. **Exploration**: Geological surveys, core drilling to test calorie, ash, seam thickness
2. **Mine Development**: Feasibility study (reserves, strip ratio, cash costs), PIT/haul road/crusher/jetty construction
3. **Production**: Overburden removal, extraction (shovel-truck), crushing, washing, blending to buyer specs
4. **Transport**: Haul to stockpile, barge (tongkang) to mother vessels (60k-180k DWT) via estafet system
5. **Reclamation**: Back-filling, revegetation. Requires Jamrek (reclamation guarantee) deposit

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Strip Ratio (SR) | Overburden (BCM) / Coal (Tonne) | Lower = lower cost, higher margin |
| GAR | Gross As Received — total calories including moisture | Used for pricing |
| NAR | Net As Received — net calories after moisture subtraction | Used for pricing |
| TM | Total Moisture — lower = higher quality | Varies by seam |
| Ash Content | Residue after combustion — lower is better | Spec-dependent |
| Total Sulfur | Environmental metric — lower = premium | <1% preferred |
| Cash Cost | Direct production costs (fuel, labor, royalties) | USD/tonne |
| ASP | Average Selling Price — driven by benchmarks | USD/tonne |

## Pricing Benchmarks

| Index | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **HBA** (Harga Batubara Acuan) | Official Indonesian government reference price. Used for royalty calculation |
| **ICI** (Indonesia Coal Index) | Spot market index for Indonesian domestic transactions |
| **Newcastle** | Global benchmark for high-calorie coal (~6322 kcal/kg GAR) |

## Shipping & Contract Terms

- **FOB**: Seller responsible until loaded on ship. Buyer handles freight/insurance.
- **CFR**: Seller pays freight to destination port.
- **Spot**: Short-term, immediate delivery at market price
- **Term Contract**: 6-12 months with pricing formula
- **Off-take**: 3-5 years, often take-or-pay, volume guaranteed

## Regulatory (Indonesia)

- **IUP**: Standard mining business license
- **IUPK**: Special license for larger/strategic entities or former PKP2B holders
- **DMO**: Must sell ≥25% of production domestically (primarily PLN) at capped price (~$70/ton for high calorie)
- **Royalty**: % of revenue paid to state, scales with HBA and mine type

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **Upstream (Bigcaps)**: AADI, BYAN, PTBA, ITMG, BUMI, GEMS
- **Upstream (Midcaps)**: HRUM, INDY, BSSR, MBAP, TOBA
- **Midstream (Logistics)**: TPMA, MBSS, PSSI, TCPI, RMKE
- **Mining Services**: UNTR, DOID, PTRO, ADMR, ABMM
