# Retail & Consumer Goods (FMCG) Framework

Efficiency-driven sector. Business is about moving inventory quickly and managing cash flow, not just high margins.

## Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC)

**CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO**

- **Lower is better**: Short cycle = fast cash generation
- **Negative is best**: Company operates on supplier money (collects from customers before paying suppliers)

## Efficiency Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark | Risk Signal |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **DIO** (Days Inventory Outstanding) | Avg Inventory / COGS x 365 | <60 days | High DIO = dead stock, obsolescence, storage costs |
| **DSO** (Days Sales Outstanding) | Avg Receivables / Revenue x 365 | <60 days | High DSO = collection issues, "fake" sales, bad debt |
| **DPO** (Days Payable Outstanding) | Avg Payables / COGS x 365 | Varies | Very high DPO may signal liquidity trouble |

- Pure retailers (minimarkets) often have near-zero DSO (cash sales)
- Distributors/wholesalers have higher DSO
- Strong companies (UNVR, INDF) can force long payment terms on suppliers (high DPO = bargaining power)

## Business Model Spectrum

| Model | Net Margin | Asset Turnover | Profit Driver |
|-------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| FMCG / Minimarket | 2-5% | High | Volume |
| Luxury / Department Store | Higher | Lower | Premium pricing |

## Same Store Sales Growth (SSSG)

- Sales growth from **existing stores only** (excludes new openings)
- Revenue growth with negative SSSG = growth purely from aggressive expansion (cannibalizes margins)
- True organic demand indicator

## Seasonality

| Period | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Q2 (Ramadan/Lebaran)** | Peak sales |
| **Q4 (Year-end)** | Strong — holidays and bonuses |

Always compare YoY (not QoQ) to account for seasonal patterns.

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **FMCG**: UNVR, ICBP, INDF, MYOR, KLBF
- **Minimarket**: AMRT (Alfamart), MIDI (Alfamidi)
- **Department Store**: LPPF (Matahari), RALS (Ramayana)
- **Specialty Retail**: ACES (Ace Hardware), ERAA (Erajaya)
