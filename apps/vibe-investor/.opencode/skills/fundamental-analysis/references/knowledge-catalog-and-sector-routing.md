# Knowledge-Catalog And Sector Routing

Use this file to route sector and mechanism-specific deep dives.

## Knowledge Catalog Usage

1. Run `list-knowledge` to discover relevant entries.
2. Run `get-knowledge` for the exact sector/mechanism playbook.
3. Apply sector framework before final verdict.

## High-Value Mechanism Entries

- `get-knowledge ownership-entities-custody-vs-active`
Use for holder interpretation to avoid custody-name misreads.

- `get-knowledge bank-ckpn-writeoff-overdue-diagnostics`
Use for bank asset-quality analysis (CKPN, write-off, overdue dynamics).

## Sector Selection Heuristic

- Bank and lender: banking references first, then ownership and liquidity checks.
- Asset-heavy cyclicals: sector-specific cost and cycle metrics before valuation conclusion.
- Property: NAV and adjusted leverage logic, not plain PER.
- Retail/FMCG: cash-conversion-cycle efficiency first, then growth narrative.
