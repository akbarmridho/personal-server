# Construction Sector Framework

High leverage, thin margins, heavy dependence on government spending/infrastructure cycles. Includes BUMN Karya and private contractors.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| New Contracts | Value of projects won during period | Leading indicator for future revenue |
| Order Book | Total pipeline (new contracts + carry over) | Sustainability of revenue |
| Burn Rate | Revenue / Order Book | Execution speed |
| Gross Margin | Gross Profit / Revenue | Typically 8-12% (thin) |
| DER | Total Debt / Equity | Normal: 1.5-2.5x; Danger: >3-5x |

## Leverage Norms

- DER 1.5-2.5x is standard — contractors pay for materials/labor upfront, get paid later
- DER >3x signals high default/restructuring risk
- **CFO check**: Negative CFO for multiple consecutive years = burning cash, surviving on new debt (Ponzi-like structure risk)

## Payment Schemes

| Scheme | Mechanism | Cash Flow Impact |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Progress Payment** | Paid based on completion % (20%, 50%, 100%) | Better for contractor cash flow |
| **Turnkey** | Contractor finances entire project. Payment only at 100% completion | Requires massive working capital debt. Owner payment delays eat all profit via interest |

Many BUMN Karya problems stemmed from massive turnkey projects.

## Margin Risk

- Contracts often fixed-price
- Rising raw material costs (steel, cement) can wipe out net profit entirely
- Working capital interest on turnkey projects compounds margin erosion

## BUMN Karya Lessons (WSKT/WIKA)

- Shifted from pure contractors to **asset owners** (toll roads)
- Funded long-term assets (toll roads break even in 10+ years) with short-term bank debt
- Planned divestment to sovereign funds (INA) delayed → interest pile-up
- Pure contractors generally safer than contractor + investment developers in high-rate environments

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **BUMN Karya**: WSKT, WIKA, PTPP, ADHI
- **Private**: ACST, TOTL, NRCA, JKON
