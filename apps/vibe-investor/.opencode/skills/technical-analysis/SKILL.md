## Data & Charting Tools

**`fetch-ohlcv`** — downloads 3 years of daily data (OHLCV, foreign flow, frequency) to a file. Save to `work/` to avoid context explosion.

**Python libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `mplfinance` for calculations and chart generation. After generating a chart, use Read to view it — visual reasoning catches things code alone misses.
