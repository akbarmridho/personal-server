# Banking Sector Framework

Banks are financial intermediaries — collecting funds from depositors at lower rates and distributing to borrowers at higher rates.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Benchmark |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| CASA Ratio | (Giro + Savings) / Total DPK | Higher = lower cost of funds |
| NIM | Net Interest Income / Earning Assets | Higher = more profitable lending |
| LDR | Total Loans / Total DPK | Ideal: 80-92% |
| CAR | Capital / Risk-Weighted Assets | Minimum: 8% (Indonesia) |
| NPL Gross | Problem Loans / Total Loans | Must stay below 5% |
| BOPO/CIR | Operating Expenses / Operating Income | Lower = more efficient |

## Revenue Streams

- **Net Interest Income (NII)**: Core revenue from lending spread
- **Fee-Based Income**: Transaction fees, wealth management, insurance distribution

## Funding Structure

| Source | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Giro (Current Account) | 0.1-0.5% | Cheapest, most desirable |
| Tabungan (Savings) | 1-2% | Mid-cost |
| Deposito (Time Deposit) | 4-6% | Most expensive |

High CASA ratio → lower cost of funds → higher NIM → premium valuation.

## Key Ratios

- **PPOP**: (NII + Non-Interest Income) − Operating Expenses. Core business strength before credit risk.
- **Cost of Credit (CoC)**: Provisioning expense / Average Loans. Indicator of asset quality stress.
- **Loan-at-Risk (LaR)**: Restructured + NPL loans as % of total. Better picture than NPL alone (post-COVID).

## Regulatory Environment

- **GWM**: Minimum reserves held at Bank Indonesia
- **BMPK**: Lending limits — 20% single borrower, 25% group
- **KPMM/CAR**: Minimum capital adequacy (8% regulatory, top banks maintain 20%+)
- **Countercyclical Buffer**: Additional capital buffer BI can activate

## Valuation

- P/E and P/B are primary methods
- ROE-PBV model works well (ROE × 10 = fair PBV)
- High CASA banks command premium valuations
- Digital banking capabilities increasingly important
- Compare: NIM, CASA, NPL, CIR across peer group

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **Big 4 (BUKU IV)**: BBCA, BBRI, BMRI, BBNI
- **Mid-tier**: BNGA, BDMN, PNBN, NISP, BTPN, MEGA, BRIS
- **Small/Digital**: ARTO, BBYB, AMAR
