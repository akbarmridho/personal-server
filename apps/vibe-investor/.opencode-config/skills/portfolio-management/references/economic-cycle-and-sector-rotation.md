# Economic Cycle And Sector Rotation

## The 6-Stage Business Cycle

| Stage | GDP | Strategy |
|-------|-----|----------|
| 1. Start of contraction | Negative growth begins | Reduce equity, accumulate bonds |
| 2. Bottoming | Still negative, deceleration slowing | Start accumulating blue chips |
| 3. Early recovery | Turns positive, below average | Move into mid-cap second-liners |
| 4. Expansion | Exceeds average | Overweight cyclicals/offensive |
| 5. Topping out | Near peak, starting to flatten | Start profit-taking, increase cash |
| 6. Early recession | Turns negative again | Heavy cash, defensive stocks only |

Critical insight: the stock market cycle usually leads the economic cycle.

## Stock Market Cycle (4 Stages)

| Stage | Economic phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Accumulation | Late recession / early recovery | Institutional/foreign entry, volume rises |
| Markup | Early to mid expansion | Broader participation and FOMO |
| Distribution | Late expansion / early contraction | Institutional profit-taking, higher volatility |
| Markdown | Mid to late contraction | Panic selling and rapid decline |

## Defensive vs Offensive Stocks

### Defensive (Recession-Resistant)

| Sector | Symbols | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Consumer goods | ICBP, INDF, UNVR | Essential daily needs |
| Banking | BBCA, BBRI, BMRI | Always needed |
| Healthcare | SILO, KLBF | Non-discretionary demand |
| Energy | PGAS, AKRA | Essential utilities |
| Telecom | TLKM, EXCL | Communication necessity |

### Offensive (Cyclicals - Expansion)

| Sector | Symbols | Rationale |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Commodities | Coal, metals, oil, CPO | Industrial demand expansion |
| Property | BSDE, CTRA, SMRA | Big-ticket demand improves |
| Construction | WIKA, PTPP, ADHI | Infrastructure spending rises |
| Cement | INTP, SMGR | Building materials demand |
| Retail | MAPI, RALS | Discretionary spending growth |
| Automotive | ASII, AUTO | Big-ticket consumer cycle |

## Rotation Transitions

| Transition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Late recession -> early recovery | Accumulate blue chips, then early-cycle industrials |
| Early recovery -> expansion | Rotate into mid-cap cyclicals, increase equity exposure |
| Late expansion -> early recession | Take profits on cyclicals, shift to defensive, raise cash |

## Indonesian Market Indicators

### Global

- PMI: >50 expansion, <50 contraction.
- Fed balance sheet: expansion tends risk-on, taper tends risk-off.
- Fed rate level/direction: lower supports acceleration, higher pressures valuation.

### Domestic

- Trade balance: surplus supports IDR, deficit pressures IDR.
- IDR/USD: weaker IDR hurts USD-liability names.
- Inflation: BI target around 3% +/- 1%.
- BI rate spread vs Fed: around 3% spread helps reduce outflow risk.
- Bond yields: higher yields can pull capital from equities.
