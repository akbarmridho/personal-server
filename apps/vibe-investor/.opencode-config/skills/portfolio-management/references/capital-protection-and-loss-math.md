# Capital Protection And Loss Math

## The Mathematics Of Recovery

| Loss | Required Gain to Break Even |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 10% | 11% |
| 25% | 33% |
| 50% | 100% |
| 75% | 300% |
| 90% | 1000% |

Principle: protecting capital is more important than chasing returns. A 50% loss requires doubling capital just to recover to zero.

## Common Money Management Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | Rule |
|---------|---------|------|
| Overdiversification (30+ stocks) | Significant gains in one stock barely impact portfolio | Quality over quantity |
| Under-diversification (1-2 stocks) | Wrong hypothesis can break portfolio | Never all eggs in one basket |
| Sector concentration | 4 banks is still one exposure cluster | Cross-sector exposure is required |
| Imbalanced sizing | One name at 50%, others at 2-5% | Use systematic sizing |
| Speculative FOMO | Buying hype without thesis | Thesis required before entry |
| All blue-chip | Stability with limited alpha | Keep balanced core/value/growth mix |
| No cash reserves | Cannot use corrections | Maintain a cash buffer |

## Practical Risk Lens

- Treat large drawdowns as compounding process risk, not temporary discomfort.
- Avoid process drift in euphoric periods.
- If your risk process is violated, fix process first before taking new exposure.
