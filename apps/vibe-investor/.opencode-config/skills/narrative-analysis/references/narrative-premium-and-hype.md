# Narrative Premium And Hype

---

# Narrative Valuation (IDX)

This entry is a compact reference for thinking about **how much "story" is priced**, and when narrative becomes too expensive.

## Decompose price into two layers

| Layer | What it represents | Typical evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Base value** | What the business is worth without "special events" | Normalized earnings/cash flow, peer multiples |
| **Narrative premium** | Extra price paid for a future story/catalyst | Re-rating, future optionality, forced-buyer events |

## Certainty becomes expensive

IDX narratives often follow this curve:

| Narrative state | Market behavior |
|---|---|
| Uncertain / not believed | Cheap but volatile, easy to doubt |
| Becoming plausible | Re-rating starts; best R/R often here |
| Consensus / "everyone knows" | Most expensive; downside asymmetry grows |

## Catalyst "priced-in" tests (reference)

| Test | If "yes", risk is higher |
|---|---|
| If the catalyst happens exactly as expected, will price still go up materially? | Narrative may be fully priced |
| Is the story now official + repeated everywhere? | Late-stage/exit-liquidity risk rises |
| Is participation/crowding expanding (SID/retail attention)? | Liquidity used for distribution |

## IDX-specific catalyst classes (where premium comes from)

| Catalyst class | Why premium appears |
|---|---|
| Index agenda (MSCI/LQ45) | Forced buyers / liquidity windows |
| Corporate actions (RI, M&A, backdoor) | Repricing via structure and control changes |
| Macro rotation (SoV/commodities) | Cross-sector money flow narratives |

# Haluasi & Re-rating Premium (IDX)

"Haluasi" (hallucination premium) is the market paying for **imagination** beyond base fundamentals. It is not "always bad"; it is a **pricing regime**.

## When haluasi premium forms

| Driver | Why it works on IDX |
|---|---|
| **Scarcity** | Limited investable proxies amplify pricing |
| **Simplicity** | One-sentence story spreads faster |
| **Forced buyers** | Index/mandate flows create liquidity windows |
| **Control/agenda** | Controlling shareholders can engineer supply/liquidity |

## Premium bands (reference)

| Premium band | Typical behavior | Failure risk |
|---|---|---|
| Moderate | Re-rating is "explainable" | Softer mean reversion |
| High | Narrative dominates numbers | -30% to -50% drawdown common on breaks |
| Extreme | Pure imagination + crowding | -50% to -80% tail risk |

## Practical failure triggers (reference)

| Trigger | Why it breaks premium |
|---|---|
| Narrative becomes stale/consensus | No incremental buyers |
| Policy/regulation blocks the catalyst | Premium collapses into base value |
| Ownership/crowding expands at highs | Exit liquidity created for stronger hands |

# Hype Lifecycle: From "Pompom" to "Cuci Piring"

This is a reference model for **how stories turn into liquidity**, then into bagholders.

## Phases (reference)

| Phase | What it looks like | Who benefits |
|---|---|---|
| **Accumulation** | Quiet; boring; limited attention; supply consolidates | Strong hands |
| **Pompom** (leak/endorsement) | Influencers/media push story; attention ramps | Strong hands (prep liquidity) |
| **Frying / Markup** | Fast price expansion; "everyone posting gains" | Strong hands + early followers |
| **Cuci piring** (dish-washing) | Crowd holds; price fades; liquidity dries | Late entrants lose |

## Influencer/template red flags

Higher probability you are late-stage when:

- multiple accounts share **near-identical** "templates" (same slides/bullets)
- the narrative is simple, viral, and detached from numbers
- the stock is already up large before the campaign intensifies

## Weekly-monthly use

Treat this as a **cycle-positioning map**:

- early-phase: focus on ownership/SID contraction (cleaning),
- late-phase: focus on "who is buying" + whether SID is expanding.

## Implementation Note

Enforcement: agent workflow during Phase 2 step 5 when haluasi/premium assessment is relevant, and when narrative involves hype/speculative dynamics (see SKILL.md). Base value vs narrative premium decomposition, premium band assessment, and hype phase identification are agent judgment. Priced-in tests and failure triggers are structured checklists. Premium band labels must match `enums-and-glossary.md`.
