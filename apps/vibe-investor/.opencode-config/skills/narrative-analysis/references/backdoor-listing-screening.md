# IDX Backdoor Listing — Shell Screening (Reference)

## Definition (practical)

**Backdoor listing** = a private entity attains a listed vehicle by taking control of an existing listed company (often weak/inactive), then **injects new assets/business** and changes control/management—achieving “listing” without a fresh IPO process.

## Why it trends on IDX

Backdoor cycles typically intensify when:

- IPO pathways are perceived as slower/tighter, or
- corporate action narratives dominate the market’s attention.

## Shell screening criteria (heuristic checklist)

Common “shell” traits often hunted in backdoor cycles:

| Criterion | Why it’s preferred |
|---|---|
| Legacy business is fading / going-concern questioned | Easier to justify pivot |
| **High controlling shareholder (PSP) stake** | Cleaner control transfer (less fragmented) |
| **Low debt** with **positive equity** | Less baggage; easier reset |
| **Small market cap** (often cited: < ~Rp 50B; sometimes tolerable to ~Rp 70B) | Cheap “listing vehicle” |
| Not under special monitoring / heavy regulatory issues | Avoids process delays |
| No major legal disputes | Reduces headline risk |

## Indonesia-specific pre-signals (often discussed)

| Signal | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Warkat → scriptless** conversion | Prepares shares for easier transfer/trading; can precede agenda execution |
| Shell scarcity + “shell price” inflation | Late-cycle phenomenon; easier shells already used |

## Post-injection reality check

After the transaction:

- price action can decouple from fundamentals for a while,
- but long-run outcome still depends on the injected business quality and governance.

Common failure mode: narrative is strong, but the injected assets do not translate into sustainable cash flows (or minority terms are unfavorable).
