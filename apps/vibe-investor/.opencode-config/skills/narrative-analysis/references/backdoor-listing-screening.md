# IDX Backdoor Listing — Screening And Cycle Reference

## Definition (practical)

**Backdoor listing** = a private entity attains a listed vehicle by taking control of an existing listed company (often weak/inactive), then **injects new assets/business** and changes control/management—achieving "listing" without a fresh IPO process.

## Why It Trends On IDX

Backdoor cycles typically intensify when:

- IPO pathways are perceived as slower/tighter, or
- corporate action narratives dominate the market's attention.

## Shell Screening Criteria (Heuristic Checklist)

Common "shell" traits often hunted in backdoor cycles:

| Criterion | Why it's preferred |
|---|---|
| Legacy business is fading / going-concern questioned | Easier to justify pivot |
| High controlling shareholder (PSP) stake | Cleaner control transfer (less fragmented) |
| Low debt with positive equity | Less baggage; easier reset |
| Small market cap (often cited: < ~Rp 50B; sometimes tolerable to ~Rp 70B) | Cheap "listing vehicle" |
| Not under special monitoring / heavy regulatory issues | Avoids process delays |
| No major legal disputes | Reduces headline risk |

## Indonesia-Specific Pre-Signals

| Signal | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Warkat → scriptless conversion | Prepares shares for easier transfer/trading; can precede agenda execution |
| Shell scarcity + "shell price" inflation | Late-cycle phenomenon; easier shells already used |
| PSP/control moves become more visible | Indicates agenda execution is near |

## Late-Cycle Dynamics (TFF/WTFF)

Backdoor/corporate-action mania tends to cluster near late-stage markets.

| Term | Practical meaning |
|---|---|
| TFF | Early-stage narrative ignition (market getting "hot") |
| WTFF | Amplified late-stage narrative frenzy |
| Peaked | Late-cycle conditions where exit-liquidity events cluster |

Why backdoor themes cluster late-cycle:

- Speculative appetite is high.
- "Real economy support" feels weak but price action is strong.
- Liquidity seeks high-beta, high-story vehicles.

## Post-Injection Reality Check

After the transaction:

- Price action can decouple from fundamentals for a while.
- Long-run outcome still depends on the injected business quality and governance.

Common failure mode: narrative is strong, but the injected assets do not translate into sustainable cash flows (or minority terms are unfavorable).

## Implementation Note

Enforcement: agent workflow when narrative type involves corporate action / backdoor listing (see SKILL.md sector and mechanism routing). Shell screening criteria are heuristic, not hard filters. Late-cycle positioning uses the TFF/WTFF framing as a cycle-awareness overlay, not a trading signal.
