# IDX Rights Issue — Purpose & Signal Map (Reference)

Rights issues on IDX are used for very different agendas. The *same* corporate action can be:

- a real growth funding event, or
- a control/asset-transfer mechanism.

## Common purposes (and what to verify)

| Purpose | What usually happens | What to verify in disclosures |
|---|---|---|
| **Survival capital** | Company needs cash to keep operating | Debt wall, cash burn, going-concern language |
| **Capex expansion** | Fund factories, fleet, stores, etc. | Capex plan, ROI logic, timeline, procurement/permits |
| **Acquisition war chest** | Raise cash to buy assets/companies | Target clarity, valuation method, related-party risk |
| **Strategic investor entry** | Investor enters via rights/placement instead of open market | Lock-up/standstill, control implications, pricing fairness |
| **Backdoor / asset injection** | Shell + new assets injected (often land/permits) | Asset appraisal, related-party terms, funding waterfall |
| **Monetize hard-to-sell assets** | Owner injects assets; cash-out via company funds or share conversion | “Wajib konversi” style terms, appraisal credibility, minority dilution |

## Pricing “premium” (exercise above market) can still be bullish

Sometimes the market reacts positively even when the exercise price is above the current market price, because it implies:

- credible value of incoming assets, or
- a strong strategic buyer willing to pay up.

**But**: without clear governance and appraisal quality, premium pricing can also be narrative fuel for a trap.

## Red flags (Indonesia-specific)

| Red flag | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Related-party asset injection** without strong, independent appraisal | Minority can be diluted into questionable assets |
| Proceeds allocated to “working capital” with vague breakdown | Hard to audit impact; can become cash extraction |
| Rights issue used repeatedly | Chronic funding dependence; thesis becomes dilution-prone |
| Complex convert/mandatory terms (“wajib konversi”) | Shifts payoff asymmetry to insiders |

## Implementation Note

Enforcement: agent workflow when narrative involves rights issue mechanics (see SKILL.md mechanism routing). Purpose classification uses filing disclosures. Red flag detection is a checklist against disclosure terms. Pricing signal interpretation is agent judgment.
