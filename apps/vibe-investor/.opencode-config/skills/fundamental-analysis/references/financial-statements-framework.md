# Financial Statements Framework

## Balance Sheet Checks

### Asset alignment

- Reclassify into working capital vs fixed assets.
- Check whether composition matches industry economics.

### Liquidity and quality

- Current ratio warning when current assets < current liabilities.
- Quick ratio warning when <0.5.
- Inventory growth should not outpace profit growth.
- Other assets should generally stay below 5% of total assets.

### Debt composition

- Distinguish operating payables vs interest-bearing debt.
- Validate equity growth source: retained earnings vs repeated capital injections.

## Income Statement Checks

- Confirm primary revenue driver from notes.
- Evaluate commodity sensitivity and pricing power.
- Separate fixed and variable cost pressure.
- Remove one-off gains from core earnings.
- Profitability floor: NPM >2% as a practical baseline.

## Cash Flow Checks

- OCF should validate accounting profit over time.
- OCF/Net Profit divergence is a trap signal.
- Debt repayment capacity should be realistic from OCF.
- Cash flow to debt guide: OCF/Total Debt >0.1.
- Dividend payout should be supported by FCF.

## Advanced Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Baseline interpretation |
|------|---------|-------------------------|
| ICR | Operating Profit / Interest Expense | <1 dangerous, >3 safer |
| NGR | (Interest-Bearing Debt - Cash) / Equity | <0.5 preferred |
| Earnings Yield | EPS / Price | Compare to risk-free context |
| EV/EBITDA | EV / EBITDA | <10 often considered cheaper |

## Trend Requirement

- Minimum 3-year trend view.
- Prefer 5-10 years for cyclical businesses.
- Track revenue, margin, ROE, cash conversion, debt path, and dividend sustainability.

## Core Formulas

- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- NPM = Net Income / Revenue
- Cash Flow to Debt = OCF / Total Debt
- FCF = OCF - CapEx
- DER = Total Debt / Total Equity
