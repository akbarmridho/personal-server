# Oil & Gas Narrative Proxies (IDX) — Reference

O&G “themes” often trade as a **rotation/narrative**. The key is picking the right **proxy** for *what the market is actually pricing* (price of oil, capex cycle, downstream margin, geopolitics).

## Proxy selection by narrative

| Narrative | Best-fit proxy type | Why | Typical proxies (examples) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Crude price direction** | Upstream E&P | Direct lifting sensitivity | MEDC, ENRG, RATU |
| **Offshore activity ramp** | OSV / offshore support | Utilization expands with drilling/maintenance | LEAD, WINS, ELPI, SOCI |
| **Work pipeline (pre-production)** | Seismic/services | Early “gateway” activity | ELSA |
| **Rig build / field construction** | Drilling/construction | Leverage to capex cycle | APEX, RUIS |
| **Domestic policy / fuel pricing** | Downstream beneficiaries | Margin depends on policy + product pricing refs | (case-by-case) |

## “Narrative quality” checklist (O&G edition)

| Check | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Is the narrative **price-led** (Brent/WTI) or **activity-led** (capex/tenders)? | Proxies differ materially |
| Does the proxy have **FX risk** (USD debt/costs vs IDR revenue)? | IDR swings can dominate |
| Is the story vulnerable to **policy** (subsidy/price intervention) or **regulatory delays**? | Can break correlation to crude |
| Is the company a **pure proxy** or a mixed conglomerate? | Mixed exposures dilute signal |

## Indonesia-specific “story breakers”

| Breaker | How it shows up |
|---|---|
| Policy/subsidy shift | Downstream margins change abruptly |
| Tender/capex delay | Services/OSV rally fades without follow-through |
| FX shock (USD/IDR) | Highly leveraged names suffer despite oil strength |
| Operational incidents (refinery disruption, field downtime) | Local headlines dominate fundamentals |
