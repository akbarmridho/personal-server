# Workflow And Operating Sequence

## Phase 1: Parallel Data Collection

Run in parallel:

- `get-stock-fundamental`
- `get-stock-financials`
- `get-stock-governance`
- `search-documents`

## Phase 2: Sequential Analysis

1. Financial statements health check
2. Valuation (2-3 methods minimum)
3. Company quality and moat assessment
4. Risk assessment and trap detection
5. Sector-specific context check

## Phase 3: Synthesis

Produce:

- Fair-value range
- Margin of safety view
- Fundamental verdict: `UNDERVALUED`, `FAIR`, or `OVERVALUED`
- Confidence level and key invalidation conditions

## Operating Rule

Fundamentals are required but not sufficient in IDX. Keep conclusions explicit about where non-fundamental factors may dominate timing.
