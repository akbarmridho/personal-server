# Property Sector Framework

Property requires unique accounting adjustments — "sales" (marketing sales) often don't appear as "revenue" for years due to PSAK 72.

## Asset Classification

| Asset Type | Description | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Inventory** | Land with completed/ongoing buildings ready for sale | Current asset |
| **Land Under Development** | Raw landbank for future projects | Top value driver |
| **Investment Property** | Malls, office towers, hotels held for rental | Check: valued at "Cost" (conservative) or "Fair Value" (can inflate equity) |

## Marketing Sales vs Revenue (PSAK 72)

- **Marketing Sales (Pre-sales)**: Contracts signed / down payments collected. Leading indicator for future revenue.
- **Accounting Revenue**: Recognized ONLY upon unit handover (serah terima) per PSAK 72.
- **Lag Time**: High-rise/apartments 3-4 years; landed houses 1-2 years.
- Record marketing sales with low/declining accounting revenue = projects still under construction (not necessarily bad).

## Financial Statement Adjustments

**Advances from Customers (Uang Muka Pelanggan)**

- Cash from buyers sits in liabilities until revenue recognition
- High "liabilities" in property is often positive — represents future revenue

**Adjusted DER**

- Standard DER overstates risk for property companies
- Adjusted DER = (Total Liabilities - Advances from Customers) / Total Equity
- Always use adjusted DER for solvency assessment

## Valuation: NAV Method

P/E is unreliable for property developers due to revenue recognition lag. Use PBV or NAV.

1. **Revalue Assets**: Land Area x Current Market Price (landbank often recorded at historical cost)
2. **Net Debt**: Interest Bearing Debt - Cash
3. **NAV**: Revalued Assets - Net Debt
4. **NAV/Share**: NAV / Total Shares

### NAV Discount

- Indonesian property stocks typically trade at **40-60% discount** to NAV
- Don't target 1x NAV unless massive bull run
- Apply historical discount to calculated NAV for target price

## Catalysts

- **Rate cuts**: Stimulates mortgage demand
- **LTV easing**: Lower down payment requirements
- **Tax incentives**: Free VAT / PPN DTP

## Key Players (IHSG)

- **Large Developers**: BSDE, CTRA, SMRA, PWON, LPKR
- **Recurring Income Focus**: SMRA, CTRA (malls/hospitals — safer in downturns vs pure developers)
- **Township Model**: BSDE (BSD City), LPKR (Lippo Village)
