# Checklists And Red Flags

## Analysis Checkpoints

### Objective

Enforce a consistent analysis flow without forcing rigid sequencing in every scenario.

### Adaptive Checklist

1. `G1_MODE` - Analysis mode and lens are explicitly declared.
2. `G2_DATA` - Data completeness and recency.
3. `G3_STATE_REGIME` - Daily state (`balance` or `imbalance`) and regime are classifiable.
4. `G4_LEVELS` - Tradable levels/zones are present.
5. `G5_PARTICIPATION` - Volume and behavior do not contradict setup.
6. `G6_STRUCTURE_CONFIRM` - Reversal intent requires `CHOCH + BOS` confirmation.
7. `G7_SETUP` - Exactly one valid setup family selected.
8. `G8_RISK` - Invalidation, stop, and size are explicit.
9. `G9_CONFLICTS` - Any chart vs numeric contradiction is resolved explicitly.
10. `G10_DELTA` - Non-initial mode includes prior snapshot, delta log, and thesis status.
11. `G11_SMC` - If lens is `SMC_ICT_LIGHT`, used SMC modules and evidence are explicitly reported.
12. `G12_VOLUME_PROFILE` - If volume-profile context is used, report POC/VAH/VAL, HVN/LVN, and prior-session POC references.
13. `G13_IMBALANCE` - If FVG/IFVG is used, report type, bounds, CE behavior, and mitigation state.
14. `G14_L2L_PATH` - If action is BUY/EXIT, report next-zone target and expected RR.
15. `G15_LIQUIDITY_MAP` - Report current draw, opposing draw, sweep event/outcome, and liquidity path state.
16. `G16_LEVEL_HEURISTICS` - Include HTF-first mapping, time-based levels, and round-number checks when relevant.
17. `G17_BREAKOUT_FILTERS` - For breakout setups, include base quality and market-context filters; MA posture should be covered in level context.
18. `G18_FIB_CONTEXT` - If Fib is used, include swing anchors, retracement interaction level, and extension target references.

### Hard Stops

- Missing required data -> stop and report dependency.
- Missing invalidation/stop for actionable call -> downgrade to `WAIT`.

### Soft Stops

- Mixed or conflicting evidence -> reduce confidence and prefer `WAIT` or smaller risk.

## Red Flags Taxonomy

### Objective

Standardize warning signals and severity assessment for risk communication.

### Red Flag IDs

- `F1_STRUCTURE_BREAK`
- `F2_DISTRIBUTION`
- `F3_WEAK_BREAKOUT`
- `F4_LEVEL_EXHAUSTION`
- `F5_DIVERGENCE_ESCALATION`
- `F6_MARKET_CONTEXT_MISMATCH`
- `F7_MA_BREAKDOWN`
- `F8_POSITION_RISK`
- `F9_NO_NEARBY_SUPPORT`
- `F10_UNCONFIRMED_CHOCH`
- `F11_MISSING_PRIOR_CONTEXT`
- `F12_SMC_EVIDENCE_GAP`
- `F13_VOLUME_CONFLUENCE_WEAK`
- `F14_IMBALANCE_QUALITY_WEAK`
- `F15_NO_NEXT_ZONE_PATH`
- `F16_LIQUIDITY_MAP_MISSING`
- `F17_BREAKOUT_STALLING`
- `F18_BREAKOUT_FILTER_WEAK`

### Severity

- `LOW`
- `MEDIUM`
- `HIGH`
- `CRITICAL`

### Agent-Assigned Flags

The following flags are assigned by the agent during analysis based on qualitative judgment, not generated by deterministic scripts:

- `F8_POSITION_RISK`
- `F11_MISSING_PRIOR_CONTEXT`

### Trace Requirements

Every red flag should include:

- `flag_id`
- `severity`
- `why`

Also include overall risk summary: `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL` with one-sentence rationale.
