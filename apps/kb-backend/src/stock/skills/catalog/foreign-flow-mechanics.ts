  content: `# Foreign Flow Mechanics

In the Indonesian market, foreign inventors often act as the primary "drivers" of price action, particularly for blue-chip stocks, though this dynamic is evolving with the rise of local conglomerates.

## 1. The Structure of Ownership

### Ownership vs. Number of Investors
- **Number of Investors**: Local individuals make up >99% of total accounts (Stock Density).
- **Market Value**: A tiny fraction of institutional and foreign accounts controls the vast majority of wealth.
- **Implication**: Do not be misled by "many people buying." 1,000 retailers buying 1 lot each is weaker than 1 foreign institution buying 10,000 lots.

### The "Driver and Stopper" Analogy
- **Foreigners (Driver)**: Dictate the direction. They buy to push price up, sell to push price down.
- **Locals (Stopper/Ganjal)**: Provide liquidity. They absorb foreign selling (providing exit liquidity) or sell to foreigners (allowing accumulation).
- **Phase dynamics**:
  - Foreign Buy + Local Sell = **Accumulation** (Bullish)
  - Foreign Sell + Local Buy = **Distribution** (Bearish)

## 2. Information Asymmetry

Foreign investors frequently have an information advantage:
- Access to better/faster research
- Move ahead of major news
- **Pattern**: Accumulate months before positive news → News Release → Retail Euphoria → Foreign Sell (Profit Taking).

## 3. Key Indicators for Foreign Flow Analysis

### Foreign Participation Rate
The percentage of total transaction value involving foreign investors.
- **> 30% Participation**: Signal that foreigners are actively controlling direction.
- **Low Participation**: Stock is likely driven by local bandars or retail crowd.

### Price Correlation (Buying Power)
Measure how closely the stock price tracks Net Foreign Buy.
- **High Correlation**: Stock is "Foreign-Driven" (e.g., Historically BBCA, TLKM).
- **Low Correlation**: Foreign flow is irrelevant; focus on Local Dealer/Bandarmology.

### Foreign Ownership Trend
- Track the accumulation of scriptless shares over time.
- **Divergence**: If price drops but Foreign Ownership keeps rising, it may be a divergence accumulation opportunity.

## 4. The Negotiated Market (Backdoor Strategy)

Big players use the Negotiated Market (*Pasar Nego*) to hide movements from the Regular Market public tape.

### The "Crossing" Maneuver
Institutional investor transfers massive blocks to a local nominee account via Nego.
- **Public View**: Foreign Net Sell in Regular Market (Panic signal).
- **Reality**: Shares just moved pockets to a local agent account, preparing for distribution or holding.

### Implications
- Always check **Total Net Buy/Sell** (Regular + Negotiated) for the full picture.
- Massive Nego crosses often precede major corporate actions or ownership changes.

## 5. Foreign Flow in "Stock Market 2.0"

**Critical Update**: Post-2020, the dominance of foreign flow has weakened due to the rise of massive local conglomerates (Barito, Bayan, etc.).
- **Old Rule**: "Foreign Net Buy = Bullish"
- **New Reality**:
  - For **Blue Chips** (Banks, Telco): Foreign flow still matters.
  - For **Conglomerate/High-Growth Stocks**: Local Bandar flow often overrides Foreign flow.
  - **Trap Alert**: Locals sometimes use foreign broker codes (ZP, AK, etc.) to simulate "Foreign Interest" and lure retail followers.
