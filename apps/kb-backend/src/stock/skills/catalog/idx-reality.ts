### Market Paradigm: "Stock Market 2.0"

The Indonesian market operates under fundamentally different rules than textbook
finance theory. Do NOT apply conventional value investing logic without adjustment.

**Core Truth**: Stock prices are driven by BANDAR AGENDA and NARRATIVES, not
corporate fundamentals. A company reporting record losses can 5x while blue chips
with record profits decline 25%. This is not an anomaly—it IS the market.

**Key Statistics (2024-2025)**:

- Retail volume: 60-70% (up from 30% pre-pandemic)
- Foreign outflow: Rp 60T+ since September 2024
- LQ45 blue chips: -10% to -25% YTD
- Small/mid cap story stocks: +100% to +500%

### Investment Approaches Hierarchy

**TIER 1 - BANDARMOLOGY (Highest Priority)**
Track big money flow, not fundamentals. Bandar (market makers) control prices.
When bandar accumulates → price will rise. When bandar distributes → price will fall.
Corporate performance is secondary to bandar's agenda.

**TIER 2 - STORY/NARRATIVE**
Current winning themes tied to Prabowo administration:

- Infrastructure: IKN (new capital), toll roads
- Consumption: Free meals program → retail/F&B
- Commodities: Nickel/EV, CPO with narrative support
- Fintech: Digital banking push

Social media buzz (X, TikTok, Telegram) is a LEADING indicator, not noise.

**TIER 3 - TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**
Use for TIMING, not selection. Key signals:

- Volume > 3-5x average = bandar activity
- Accumulation patterns before breakout
- RSI/MA for entry optimization

**TIER 4 - FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS**
Use as FILTER only, NOT as primary driver:

- Validates if story is sustainable
- Risk assessment for position sizing
- Peace of mind for longer holds

Low P/E or P/BV does NOT mean stock will rise. "Cheap" stocks can stay cheap 
forever if bandar has no agenda.

### Critical Warnings

**Traps to Avoid**:

1. "Foreign buying = quality" → Often locals using foreign brokers to mislead
2. "High dividend = safe" → Frequently used as distribution trap
3. "Hold together to defeat bandar" → Dangerous myth; bandar controls price
4. "Good fundamental = price will rise" → Decoupled in Stock Market 2.0
5. "News drives price" → 95% of news is noise; bandar uses it for sentiment

**Blue Chip Reality (Saham Konglo)**:
LQ45 stocks like BBCA, BBRI, TLKM, ASII are currently in "value trap" territory.
Foreign selling pressure + low retail interest = stagnant or declining prices
despite strong fundamentals.

### Market Regime Assessment

When analyzing any stock, first determine:

1. **Who is the bandar?** (Local conglomerate? Foreign institution? Retail-driven?)
2. **What phase?** (Accumulation → Markup → Distribution → Markdown)
3. **What narrative?** (Policy tie? Sector theme? Pure speculation?)
4. **Where is foreign flow?** (Net buyer = bullish signal; net seller = caution)

### Risk Management

For sustainable returns, apply this checklist:

- [ ] Story/narrative is present AND
- [ ] Broker summary shows smart money buying AND
- [ ] Volume confirms accumulation AND
- [ ] Fundamentals don't have fatal flaws
