      "title": "US Involvement in Israel-Iran Conflict Determined Within 2 Weeks",
      "content": "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday (June 19) that U.S. President Donald Trump will decide within the next two weeks whether to attack Iran. The statement delivered via Leavitt was softer than Trump's earlier remarks, which had named Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as an \"easy target\" and urged Iranian citizens to evacuate. Leavitt's comment came a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that Trump had told senior officials this week that he approved a plan to strike Iran. However, the Wall Street Journal source said Trump is still delaying the attack to see if the Iranian government will halt its nuclear program. The Israel-Iran conflict has entered its eighth day, with neither side showing signs of a cease-fire. In response, foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the EU foreign policy chief are scheduled to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in Geneva on Friday (June 20) to try to de-escalate the conflict. British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the next two weeks represent the last diplomatic window to prevent a wider escalation in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Russia and China publicly condemned Israel and called for immediate de-escalation. Key Takeaway: The two-week deadline set by Trump eases concerns of immediate U.S. military involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. In response, Brent futures for September 2025 fell 2.04% to about $75.5 per barrel in intraday trading on Friday (June 20), although they are up 3.7% over the past week. Equity markets reacted mixed: Nikkei -0.22%, EURO STOXX 50 +0.8%, S&P Futures -0.28%. The Indonesian composite index (IHSG) fell another 0.88% today after a 1.96% drop yesterday, indicating profit-taking amid rising geopolitical uncertainty.",
