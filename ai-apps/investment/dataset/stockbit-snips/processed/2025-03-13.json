      "title": "Penerimaan Anjlok, APBN Defisit pada 2M25",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance held a briefing on the realization of the 2025 State Budget (APBN) on Thursday (13/3). This is the first APBN briefing in 2025, after the Ministry did not hold a discussion for January 2025 last month. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the briefing on the realization of the APBN for January 2025 was not carried out to ensure comparable and accurate data presentation, considering several factors that occurred at the beginning of the year.\n\nKey notes on the APBN realization for the first two months of 2025 (2M25):\n- Revenue fell 20.8% year‑on‑year (YoY), equal to 10.5% of the target. Deputy Finance Minister Anggito Abimanyu said gross tax revenue during 2M25 slowed down (-20.8% YoY) due to lower commodity prices, including coal (-11.8% YoY), Brent oil (-5.2% YoY) and nickel (-5.9% YoY). The decline in tax revenue also resulted from tax administration factors, such as the implementation of the Effective Average Rate (TER) policy for personal income tax (PPh 21) and the relaxation of domestic VAT payment until the 10th day (until 10 March 2025) for tax reporting.\n- Expenditure fell 7% YoY, equal to 9.6% of the target. Deputy Finance Minister Suahasil Nazara said state spending dropped -7% YoY during 2M25 because of a high‑base effect from high expenditures at the end of 2023 to early 2024 due to El Niño. He also explained that President Prabowo Subianto's instruction on ministry/agency spending efficiency up to IDR 306.7 trillion aims to fund priority government programs, add fiscal space for productive spending, and finance the new regional head vision‑mission programs.\n- Deficit appeared earlier, reaching 0.13% of GDP. With this progress, the APBN recorded a deficit of IDR 31.2 trillion or 0.13% of GDP during 2M25, marking an earlier deficit compared to the previous year (vs. February 2024: surplus 0.11% of GDP). This is the first time the APBN posted a deficit in the first two months of the fiscal year since 2021, according to Bloomberg.\n- Budget financing reached 35.7% of the target. Sri Mulyani also noted a large issuance at the beginning of the year, so budget financing reached IDR 220.1 trillion (vs. the 2025 APBN target of IDR 616.2 trillion). Nevertheless, this progress is similar to the February 2024 realization, which reached 35.4% of the 2024 APBN target.\n\nWhen closing the press conference, Sri Mulyani opened the possibility that the APBN realization briefing could be skipped in certain months due to internal data considerations.\n\nIn addition to the APBN issue, Bloomberg reported that there is a rumor President Prabowo is preparing a cabinet reshuffle, which may involve Sri Mulyani. The Presidential Communication Office spokesperson Phillips J. Vermonte declined to comment but emphasized that President Prabowo has the prerogative to conduct a reshuffle. Sri Mulyani herself declined to comment to several national media outlets on Wednesday (12/3).",

A weak rupiah narrows the space for Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates, even though expectations of Fed rate cuts have increased recently amid investor worries about a potential US recession due to trade wars.
