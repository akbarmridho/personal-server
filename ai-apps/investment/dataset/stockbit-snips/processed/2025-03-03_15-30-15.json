      "title": "HGBT Incentives Officially Continued",
      "content": "The government has officially continued the specific natural gas price incentive (HGBT) through the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree which was announced last week. Compared to the previous regulation, the extension of the HGBT incentive sets the gas price (plant gate) from the range of 6-7 US dollars per MMBTU to 6.5-7 US dollars per MMBTU. This price will be retroactive starting from January 2025, with a validity period of 5 years. HGBT will still be granted to the 7 recipient industrial sectors as per the previous regulation, namely ceramics, fertilizer, petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, glass, and rubber gloves. The Chairman of the Association of Indonesian Ceramic Industries (Asaki), Edy Suryanto, stated that the extension of HGBT is needed to maintain and increase the competitiveness of the domestic ceramic industry, and to provide business certainty and a conducive investment climate. Edy explained that the HGBT incentive in 2020-2024 has encouraged the addition of new national ceramic tile production capacity by 90 million square meters, foreign direct investment ranging from 20-23 trillion rupiah, and the absorption of approximately 15,000 new workers. Following the continuation of the HGBT incentive, Edy explained that Asaki members will immediately increase ceramic tile production capacity by 45 million square meters per year through an investment worth 4 trillion rupiah which is expected to absorb 5,000 new workers. This expansion is targeted for completion at least in 2H26. Although Asaki does not object to the increase in the HGBT tariff, Edy mentioned that they requested the incentive to be fully implemented on the ground, with gas supply having to match the industry's needs listed in the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree. Previously, Edy mentioned that Perusahaan Gas Negara increased the surcharge or additional fee for gas usage above the certain industrial gas allocation (AGIT) from 13.85 US dollars per MMBTU to 16.77 US dollars per MMBTU from January 1 to March 31, 2025. Edy revealed that if this surcharge were implemented, the objective of HGBT to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry and support economic growth would not be realized.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway: HGBT Continuation",
      "content": "We are of the view that the continuation of the HGBT incentive will provide positive sentiment for issuers sensitive to gas prices, especially Arwana Citramulia ($ARNA), because: - The extension of the HGBT incentive ensures ARNA can still access cheaper gas, considering energy costs contributed approximately 32% of the company's production costs in 2024. - The new price in the 2025 HGBT incentive is retroactive as of January 1, 2025, so ARNA will not pay for gas based on more expensive market prices during January-February 2025. - Based on our estimation, the increase in the HGBT tariff will only cause ARNA's gas costs to rise by about +10%, while ARNA only needs to increase its average selling price by about +2% to cover this gas price increase, which we believe will not be difficult, especially following the regulation on ceramic anti-dumping import duties (BMAD). The extension of the HGBT incentive with a moderate price increase provides certainty and stability to ARNA's production costs. We see that with the continuation of the HGBT incentive, ARNA will still be able to achieve double-digit growth in 2025 with net profit around 500 billion rupiah (more than +17% YoY). With this projected double-digit net profit growth, ARNA is currently traded at a valuation of <10x FY25 P/E and a dividend yield of around 6-7%, which we consider quite attractive.",
