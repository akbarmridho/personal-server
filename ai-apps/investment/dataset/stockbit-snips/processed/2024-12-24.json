      "content": "Bank Mandiri reported net profit (bank only) of 4.1 trillion rupiah for November 2024, a decline of 9.7% YoY but an increase of 1.4% MoM. This result brings the net profit (bank only) for the first eleven months of 2024 (11M24) to 47.2 trillion rupiah, up 4.7% YoY and above the FY24 consolidated consensus growth estimate of 2% YoY. Negative factors include a weakening Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Non-Interest Income (NII). Positive factors include a maintained credit cost (CoC) and strong credit growth. NIM fell to 4.4% in November 2024 (down 22 basis points YoY and 17 basis points MoM), causing the 11M24 NIM to decline to 4.6% (down 32 basis points YoY), below the FY24 consolidated guidance range of 5-5.3%. Non-Interest Income recorded 2.5 trillion rupiah in November 2024 (down 19% YoY and 4.5% MoM), resulting in 11M24 Non-Interest Income growth slowing to 2% YoY (vs 11M23: 15% YoY, 10M24: 4.6% YoY). The weakening Non-Interest Income pressured Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) to 5.4 trillion rupiah (down 2.6% YoY and 5.1% MoM) in November 2024, though 11M24 PPOP remained solid at 64.9 trillion rupiah, up 6.1% YoY. CoC stood at 0.3% in November 2024 (up 28 basis points YoY and down 61 basis points MoM), keeping the 11M24 CoC at 0.7%, better than the FY24 consolidated guidance of up to 1%. The annual CoC increase was due to a low-base effect in November 2023. Credit growth was strong, with a 22.7% YoY increase in 11M24 (vs 11M23: 14% YoY, 10M24: 22.5% YoY), surpassing the FY24 consolidated guidance range of 16-18%. Third-party funds (DPK) grew 15% YoY (vs 11M23: 6% YoY, 10M24: 13% YoY) over 11M24. Although loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) eased, it remained relatively high at 93.9% in November 2024 (vs 11M23: 87.7%, 10M24: 95.1%), one of the highest among the big banks. The analysis concludes that BMRI's bank-only performance in November 2024 was fairly good, especially due to the maintained CoC indicating asset quality preservation. While NIM weakened, the consolidated NIM is supported by subsidiary NIMs. Liquidity is relatively tight compared to other big banks, limiting future credit growth potential and raising the risk of higher cost of funds due to competition for DPK growth.",
