      "content": "XLSmart Telecom Sejahtera ($EXCL) has announced its financial performance for 1Q25 - which is the performance of XL Axiata before merging with Smartfren Telecom - with a net profit of 385 billion rupiah (-29% YoY, -23% QoQ). This result is below expectations (17% of the 2025F consensus estimate). Operationally, EXCL recorded 58.9 million mobile customers in 1Q25 (+2.3% YoY, +0.2% QoQ), with the average revenue per user (ARPU) declining to 40 thousand rupiah (-9% YoY, -2% QoQ). EXCL management stated in an earnings call on Tuesday (6/5) that excluding revenue from the fixed broadband business (First Media) which was only reflected in the financial statements at the end of 2024, the company's revenue actually decreased by -5% YoY in 1Q25. EXCL management explained that the decline in ARPU in 1Q25 was caused by weakening purchasing power and tighter competition due to competitors selling starter packs at cheaper prices. Nevertheless, management sees that the intensity of competition among operators is starting to subside and is expected to reflect positively starting in 2H25. In line with the merger which was just completed on April 16, 2025, EXCL management is still in the operational integration phase and therefore cannot provide guidance for 2025. However, management expects merger cost synergy to reach 100 million US dollars this year. Management will also anticipate a slight increase in expenses and capex at the beginning of the integration process, before they are expected to decrease in the long run. In the earnings calls of Telkom Indonesia ($TLKM), Indosat ($ISAT), and EXCL, management each stated that the intensity of competition among operators is starting to subside and is expected to be reflected positively in 2H25. We assess that the potential subsiding of competition among operators is based on the declining ARPU trend, where TLKM continues to drop closer to the psychological level of 40 thousand rupiah (1Q25: 42.4 thousand rupiah, 4Q24: 44 thousand rupiah) and EXCL has reached 40 thousand rupiah. Furthermore, the continuous decline in data yield will damage the profitability of all industry players going forward. Specifically for EXCL, the 2Q25 performance release will be the new base of the merged entity, so the company's future performance will be assessed using that figure.",
