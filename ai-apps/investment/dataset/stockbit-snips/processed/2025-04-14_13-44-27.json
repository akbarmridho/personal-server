      "title": "MSCI: BREN, CUAN, and PTRO Remain Excluded from May 2025 Review",
      "content": "MSCI on Friday (11/4) announced that Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN), Petrindo Jaya Kreasi ($CUAN), and Petrosea ($PTRO) will remain excluded from inclusion in the May 2025 index review. This announcement was an update after MSCI opened input from market participants and investors regarding the investment viability of these three stocks. Previously, MSCI determined that BREN, CUAN, and PTRO would not be included in the MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index in the February 2025 index review due to potential investability constraints. In the announcement on Friday (11/4), MSCI also explained that it is reviewing the addition of regulations where stocks on the IDX that have been included in unusual market activity (UMA) announcements and/or monitoring boards due to unusual price movements in the last 12 months will not be considered for inclusion in the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. MSCI opened input from market participants regarding these regulatory changes until June 20, 2025, with updates to be announced on July 11, 2025. For additional information, here are the last dates BREN, CUAN, and PTRO received UMA signs and/or monitoring board inclusion: BREN: June 20, 2024 (last trading day in the special monitoring board). CUAN: January 8, 2025 (UMA). PTRO: September 4, 2024 (UMA). Following the MSCI announcement, the share prices of BREN, CUAN, and PTRO closed up +9.71%, +7.5%, and +4% respectively on Monday (14/4). Key Takeaway: We assess that the precedent set by these three stocks, along with potential additional regulations related to UMA and the special monitoring board, may complicate a stock's prospect of entering the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. If realized, this regulation addition would increase the influence of regulators - in this case, the IDX - in determining the eligibility of a stock for inclusion in the MSCI index.",

      "title": "US President Donald Trump Insists on Tariffs for Imported Electronics; Indonesia Proposes USD 18-19 Billion Import Increase to Mitigate Trade Deficit",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, said on Sunday (13/4) that he will still impose tariffs on imported smartphones, computers, and other popular electronic goods. Trump's clarification came after these goods were exempted from reciprocal tariffs last weekend. Trump also signaled that details regarding tariffs for semiconductor commodities would be announced this week. The Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, stated that the Indonesian government proposed importing approximately 18-19 billion US dollars worth of US goods in a tariff negotiation proposal with the US government. This proposal aims to cover the US trade deficit with Indonesia, which was recorded at 16.8 billion US dollars during 2024. Additionally, the Deputy Minister of Investment and Downstreaming of Indonesia, Todotua Pasaribu, mentioned that the proposal also suggests that Indonesian State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) invest in the US oil, gas, and information technology sectors. Chief Investment Officer of BPI Danantara, Pandu Sjahrir, said on Monday (14/4) that they are ready to become a liquidity provider in the Indonesian capital market. Pandu's statement came after the Chairman of the OJK Supervisory Board, Mahendra Siregar, stated on Friday (11/4) that the OJK had coordinated with BPI Danantara to encourage government-owned financial service institutions to make larger investments in the capital market as institutional investors. Pandu mentioned that BPI Danantara is currently reviewing a plan for fund placement derived from dividend income to be received at the end of April 2025. The China Customs Administration noted that China's coal imports decreased by -6.4% YoY to 38.73 million tons in March 2025. This realization was pressed down by high port inventories and weak domestic demand, pushing spot market prices to their lowest level in the last four years. This result also marked the first annual decline in China's coal imports since March 2022, excluding the January-February period when the year-on-year comparison was influenced by the Lunar New Year holiday. The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded that domestic motorcycle sales reached 541,684 units in March 2025 (-7.2% YoY, -6.8% MoM). This result brought total domestic motorcycle sales during 3M25 to approximately 1.7 million units (-3% YoY), equivalent to 25-26% of AISI's 2025 target set around 6.4-6.7 million units. President Prabowo Subianto claimed on Sunday (13/4) that Qatar has committed to investing 2 billion US dollars in a joint fund for BPI Danantara. Goldman Sachs raised its gold price forecast to 3,700 US dollars per troy ounce by the end of 2025, driven by growing concerns about the US economy amid the escalation of the trade war with China. This marks the third upgrade to the gold price outlook from Goldman Sachs this year, after the investment bank raised its 2025 gold price target to 3,300 US dollars per troy ounce in March 2025. Goldman Sachs also warned that, in an extreme risk scenario, the price of gold could reach 4,500 US dollars per troy ounce by the end of 2025. Bank Indonesia noted that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of March 2025 rose to 157.1 billion US dollars (vs. February 2025: 154.5 billion US dollars), equivalent to financing 6.7 months of imports or 6.5 months of imports and government foreign debt payments. This development was influenced by tax and service receipts as well as the drawdown of government foreign loans, amidst the policy of stabilizing the Rupiah exchange rate. Pertamina Geothermal Energy ($PGEO) signed a joint study agreement with the Turkish company, Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim A.S., as a step to explore cooperation in the development of a Geothermal Power Plant (PLTP) project in Zorlu Enerji's geothermal working area in Turkey.",
