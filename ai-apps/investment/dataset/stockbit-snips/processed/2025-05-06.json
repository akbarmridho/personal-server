Director of the Indonesia Stock Exchange, Irvan Susandy, said on Monday (5/5) that the exchange will soon implement the opening of broker codes and domicile, although details were not provided. He explained that the opening will not be real-time; data will be sent after the break following the first trading session. The initiative is still under development due to changes in the exchange's system.\n2. A residential property price survey by Bank Indonesia showed that residential property price growth slowed to +1.07% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. +1.89% YoY in 1Q24 and +1.39% YoY in 4Q24), marking the weakest growth since 3Q21. Meanwhile, residential property sales in 1Q25 grew +0.73% YoY (vs. +31.16% YoY in 1Q24 and -15.09% YoY in 4Q24), supported by a +21.75% YoY increase in sales of small-type houses (vs. +37.84% YoY in 1Q24 and -23.7% YoY in 4Q24) amid a contraction in medium-type house sales of -35.76% YoY (vs. +13.57% YoY in 1Q24 and -16.61% YoY in 4Q24) and large-type house sales of -11.69% YoY (vs. +48.51% YoY in 1Q24 and +20.44% YoY in 4Q24).\n3.

Sources said a memorandum of understanding could be signed by the end of May 2025, but discussions are ongoing and plans may change.\n4. Bloomberg reported that electric-vehicle battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) is seeking a loan of about 1 billion US dollars to finance its investment in Indonesia.

The Chairman of the Indonesian Gas Users Industry Forum, Yustinus Gunawan, said on Monday (5/5) that gas supply realization was far below the allocated incentive price for certain natural gas (HGBT), with only 54% realized in January 2025. Excess usage will be charged a regasification tariff of 16.77 US dollars per MMBtu. He also noted that the excess payment in January 2025 has not been compensated by Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) or other gas distributors. Specific industrial gas allocation (AGIT) reached 73% in February 2025 and 76% in March 2025.\n6. President Prabowo Subianto said on Monday (5/5) that he will meet Bill Gates on Wednesday (7/5), claiming Gates offered support for social programs in Indonesia.

The Director of APBN Preparation at the Ministry of Finance, Rofyanto Kurniawan, said on Monday (5/5) that the government will allocate 268 trillion rupiah for the free nutritious-meal program in 2026, an increase of about 57% YoY from the 2025 allocation of 171 trillion rupiah. After reaching the 2025 target of 82.9 million beneficiaries, the focus will shift to improving program quality. The program is expected to contribute 1.03% to 2026 GDP, create more than 1.32 million jobs, and help reduce poverty by 0.38 percentage points.",

      "content": "XLSmart Telecom Sejahtera ($EXCL) has announced financial performance for 1Q25 – which is the performance of XL Axiata before merger with Smartfren Telecom – with net profit of 385 billion rupiah (-29% YoY, -23% QoQ). This result is below expectations (17% of the 2025F consensus estimate).\n\nCustomer count up, ARPU down\n\nOperationally, EXCL recorded mobile subscriber base of 58.9 million in 1Q25 (+2.3% YoY, +0.2% QoQ), with average revenue per user (ARPU) falling to 40 thousand rupiah (-9% YoY, -2% QoQ).\n\nManagement said in earnings call on Tuesday (6/5) that excluding revenue from fixed broadband business (First Media) which will be reflected in financial statements at end of 2024, the company's revenue actually fell -5% YoY in 1Q25.\n\nManagement explained that ARPU decline in 1Q25 was caused by weakening purchasing power and tighter competition as rivals offered cheaper starter packages. Nevertheless, management sees competition intensity among operators easing and expected to reflect positively in 2H25.\n\nMerger completed, operational integration continues\n\nFollowing the merger that was completed on 16 April 2025, EXCL management is still in operational integration phase and cannot provide guidance for 2025. However, management expects merger cost synergy of 100 million US dollars this year. Management also anticipates a slight increase in expenses and capex at the early integration stage, before expected to decline in the long term.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn earnings calls of Telkom Indonesia ($TLKM), Indosat ($ISAT), and EXCL, each management said competition intensity among operators is easing and expected to reflect positively in 2H25. We assess the potential easing based on ARPU decline trend, where TLKM continues to fall near psychological level of 40 thousand rupiah (1Q25: 42.4 thousand rupiah, 4Q24: 44 thousand rupiah) and EXCL has reached 40 thousand rupiah. Additionally, continuous decline in data yield will damage profitability of all industry players.\n\nFor EXCL, the 2Q25 performance release will become a new base for the merged entity, so future performance will be evaluated using that figure.",
