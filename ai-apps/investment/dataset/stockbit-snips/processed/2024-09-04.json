      "title": "Investment Realization 2025 Targeted to Increase +15.5% YoY",
      "content": "Minister of Investment Rosan Roeslani said the government targets investment realization of 1,905 trillion rupiah in 2025, up 15.5% year-on-year compared with the 2024 target. Cumulatively, the government targets total investment realization of 11,855 trillion rupiah for the 2025-2029 period. The breakdown is as follows: Rosan claimed that the 1,905 trillion rupiah target for 2025 could boost economic growth to +5.6% YoY, higher than the government's own target of +5.2% YoY and the International Monetary Fund's projection of +5.1% YoY. Rosan mentioned that the sectors to be focused on are green investment, connectivity infrastructure, energy transition and downstream processing, as well as export-based investment. On the other hand, Rosan noted that the limited budget of the Ministry of Investment in 2025 could hinder the achievement of the investment target. The ministry's budget fell 44.5% YoY to about 681.9 billion rupiah in 2025, only 43.4% of the planned budget requirement. Key Takeaway: If achieved, higher investment realization prospects could provide a positive catalyst for banking issuers such as BBCA, BBRI, BMRI and BBNI as a proxy for Indonesia's economic growth. In addition, the government's focus on export-based and downstream investment could benefit infrastructure downstream providers such as AKRA, which operates the JIIPE industrial zone.",
