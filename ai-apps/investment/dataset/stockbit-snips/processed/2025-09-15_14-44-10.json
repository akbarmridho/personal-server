      "content": "In terms of valuation, this acquisition value represents an EV/Reserves of approximately 5.6 billion Rupiah per ounce and EV/Resources of 2.8 billion Rupiah per ounce, below the average valuation of peers which reached 11.5 billion Rupiah per ounce and 8.3 billion Rupiah per ounce, respectively (see table above). In terms of contribution, UNTR's gold reserves and resources will increase by +38% and +42% respectively, to 5,734 koz and 10,507 koz after this transaction is completed. However, due to UNTR's large scale, this acquisition value (enterprise value) is only equivalent to ~9% of UNTR's EV as of Monday (15/9). UNTR's stock price has strengthened by +8.8% in the last 1 month. Meanwhile, for PSAB, the Doup mine is one of the company's main assets, where Doup's reserves and resources are equivalent to 61% and 51% of PSAB's total reserves and resources, respectively.",

The Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, said on Monday (15/9) that the financing scheme for the Village Cooperatives (Kopdes) Merah Putih will use a liquidity injection of 200 trillion Rupiah placed by the government into state-owned bank conglomerates (Himbara). On the same occasion, the Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, said that the government requested an acceleration of loan disbursement for the Kopdes Merah Putih program, adding that the government wants 16,000 Kopdes to be funded by the end of this month. The government noted that Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), and Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS), have identified over 1,000 qualifying Kopdes potentially borrowing 1.06 trillion Rupiah. Purbaya explained that Himbara can reduce the interest they pay on government deposits to 2% if the funds are channeled to Kopdes. Previously, Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) explained that the placement of these government cash reserves will be placed in a 6-month renewable call deposit instrument with an interest/yield of ~4%. 4. The national cement industry sales volume fell -3.8% YoY in August 2025, according to data from Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa (INTP) management. This result caused the national cement industry's sales volume for 8M25 to fall -3.3% YoY (vs. 8M24 including Grobogan cement: +2.3% YoY). INTP management explained that the decline in industry-wide cement sales volume was affected by demonstration activities in late August 2025. In terms of segmentation, bagged cement sales volume weakened -0.3% YoY during 8M25 (vs. 8M24: -1.7% YoY), while bulk cement fell -10% YoY (vs. 8M24: +12% YoY). 5. The Directorate General of Taxes of the Ministry of Finance noted that net tax revenue, or tax deposits after deducting refunds, reached 990.01 trillion Rupiah during 7M25 (-5.29% YoY), equivalent to 47.7% of the 2025 State Budget (APBN) outlook target of 2,077 trillion Rupiah. Meanwhile, gross tax revenue, or total tax deposits before refunds, reached 1,269.4 trillion Rupiah during 7M25 (+2.3% YoY). 6. The Solvent Extractors' Association of India noted that India's palm oil imports in August 2025 rose to 990,528 tons (+15.8% MoM), marking the highest monthly level since July 2024. This realization was driven by more competitive palm oil prices compared to soybean oil, thus boosting purchases ahead of the festive season.",
