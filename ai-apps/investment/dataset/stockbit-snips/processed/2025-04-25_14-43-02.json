      "content": "1. Bloomberg reported on Friday (25/4) that the Chinese government is considering suspending the 125% tariff on some US imports - including medical equipment, some industrial chemicals such as ethane, to aircraft leases - in order to reduce the burden on industries that still rely on US products. Previously, the US suspended the 145% tariff on smartphones, computers, and other imported electronic goods originating from China. Bloomberg reported that investors are currently waiting to see if both countries will reduce their respective tariffs, although the prospect of this still seems stalled. 2. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said on Friday (25/4) that the Indonesian government will prioritize its national interest in tariff negotiations with the US, adding that Indonesia wants a \"fair and honest\" trade relationship. However, Airlangga did not share specific details about the negotiations. Previously, the Indonesian government proposed increasing its imports from the US up to 19 billion US dollars in the negotiation proposal to cover the US trade deficit. For comparison, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus with the US of 16.8 billion US dollars during 2024. 3. The World Bank cut the economic growth outlook for Indonesia in 2025 to +4.7% YoY, lower than the projection made in October 2024 at +5.1% YoY. The World Bank stated on Thursday (24/4) that the outlook change they made does not only consider the regional economic growth prospects but also considers the country's related policies amid global uncertainty. Besides the World Bank, the IMF also cut Indonesia's economic growth projection for 2025 this week from +5.1% YoY to +4.7% YoY. 4. The Deputy at the Ministry of Investment and Downstreaming, Nurul Ichwan, admitted to a downsizing of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL)'s investment in the battery cell manufacturing project with Industry Battery Corporation. This downsizing reduces CATL's investment in the project to only 417 million US dollars, compared to the initial plan of 1.18 billion US dollars. Nurul explained that the reduction in investment value occurred after CATL observed that the demand from electric cars was not as expected. Previously, the consortium led by LG withdrew from another electric vehicle battery supply chain project in Indonesia for similar reasons. 5. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, said on Thursday (24/4) that the government is still reviewing the funding scheme for the village cooperative program which requires 400 trillion rupiah. Sri Mulyani explained that there are at least 3 funding schemes being reviewed, namely funding from public funds, loans from state-owned banks, or transfers to the regions. Sri Mulyani's statement signals that the government is not certain about involving state-owned banks in the village cooperative program. Previously, the Coordinating Minister for Food, Zulkifli Hasan, stated in early March 2025 that state-owned banks would be involved in funding the program. 6. Bank Indonesia noted that the growth of economic liquidity or broad money supply (M2) in March 2025 slowed to +6.1% YoY to the level of 9,436.4 trillion rupiah (vs. Feb 2025: +6.2% YoY). This development was driven by the growth of narrow money supply (M1) by +7.1% YoY and quasi money by +3% YoY. 7. Asia Pulp & Paper Co. along with Royal Golden Eagle and Suzano SA are the final bidders for Kimberly-Clark's international tissue business valued at 4 billion US dollars, according to a Reuters report on Thursday (24/4). These three companies are reportedly conducting due diligence regarding the potential acquisition and are expected to submit bids in mid-May 2025. Kimberly-Clark's international tissue business reportedly has an EBITDA of around 500 million US dollars, according to Reuters sources. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Asia Pulp & Paper Co. was seeking a 2 billion US dollar loan to support the acquisition attempt.",

      "title": "AKRA 1Q25: Net Profit -5% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "AKR Corporindo ($AKRA) recorded a net profit of 565 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (-5% YoY, -25% QoQ), equivalent to 23% of the consensus 2025F estimate and around 22-24% of management's 2025 guidance. Although there were no JIIPE land sales in 1Q25, management stated that potential land sales during 1H25 range from 20-45 ha. 1. PBT of Trading and Distribution Segment Grew +16% YoY Profit before tax (PBT) from the 'trading and distribution' segment - which contributes about 65-75% of total PBT - experienced a recovery, growing +16% YoY during 1Q25. Gross profit from this segment also increased +17% YoY, exceeding management's 2025 guidance targeting +5-7% YoY. The increase in the performance of the 'trading and distribution' segment was mainly supported by the low-base effect in 1Q24 due to RKAB permit issues with customers in the mining segment. Going forward, AKRA management maintains the guidance for gross profit in the 'trading and distribution' segment at the range of +5-7% YoY throughout 2025, considering the potential weakening of fuel (BBM) demand volume due to weakening commodity prices in the mining sector. To address this issue, management will optimize revenue from the retail segment (bp AKR) and the chemical raw material trading segment. 2. No JIIPE Land Sales in 1Q25, But Projected 20-45 ha in 2Q25 Although there were no JIIPE land sales in 1Q25, AKRA management has confirmed that there will be a 20 ha land sale in 2Q25 to Golden Elephant, which will be reflected in the financial statements. The realized sale of 20 ha is already higher than the realization in 1H24 at 18.1 ha. Apart from the land sale to Golden Elephant, AKRA management projects an additional sale of around 20-25 ha in 2Q25. If realized, JIIPE land sales in 1H25 have the potential to reach 40-45 ha in 1H25, equivalent to 40-45% of the 2025 target of 100 ha. During 1Q25, the 'industrial estate' segment still recorded profit from recurring income in the form of land rent as well as electricity and utility revenues. AKRA management expects recurring income in this segment to increase further in the coming quarters, driven by increased utilization from the Xinyi Glass factory and the Freeport copper smelter, which are targeted to resume operations in June 2025. AKRA management explained that the escalation of the trade war between the US and China provides an opportunity for the company, where several Chinese companies will start expanding abroad to reduce the risk of tariffs imposed by the US. 3. Final Dividend for Fiscal Year 2024 of Rp50/Share, Indication Yield of 4.2% AKRA management proposes the distribution of the 2024 fiscal year dividend amounting to 1.97 trillion rupiah or equivalent to an 88% dividend payout ratio in the GMS to be held on April 28, 2025. This amount implies a final dividend of 50 rupiah per share, with an indicative dividend yield of 4.2% as of Friday (25/4). Previously, AKRA distributed an interim dividend for the 2024 fiscal year of 987 billion rupiah or 50 rupiah per share in August 2024. Key Takeaway Although only equivalent to 23% of the consensus 2025F estimate and 22-24% of management's 2025 guidance, we assess AKRA's performance in 1Q25 as relatively in line with expectations. This is based on the factor of the shift in Eid al-Fitr seasonality to the end of 1Q25 and the projection of increased industrial land sales in the following quarters. Although global economic uncertainty is high and commodity prices are low, we remain optimistic that AKRA can achieve the 2025 guidance, considering: 1) this guidance is already quite conservative compared to the 2024 realization; and 2) AKRA has secured a backlog of unexecuted land sale contracts in 2024.",
