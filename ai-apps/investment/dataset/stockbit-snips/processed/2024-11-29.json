According to a Bloomberg report, OPEC usually changes the meeting date when more time is needed to finalize an agreement.

The dividend amount is close to the analyst’s estimate of IDR 1,359 per share and is sufficient to cover the cost of exercising the PUPS for AADI, excluding a 0.18% transaction fee charged by Trimegah Sekuritas as underwriter. The stock was locked in an auto‑reject bottom at IDR 2,070 before closing down 24.6% to IDR 2,080, indicating the price decline since the cum date exceeds the dividend amount. Investors could benefit more by using the dividend to participate in the AADI PUPS, as the AADI share price could appreciate, whereas non‑participants would miss out on the thermal coal business valued at 2.7× 1H24 annualised P/E, below the five‑year historical mean and peers. The redemption period is expected to be 7‑10 December 2024 with distribution on 10‑11 December; the latest cut‑off is 10:00 WIB each trading day, with any exercise after that processed the next trading day.",
