      "content": "Several residential property developers announced their 2024 marketing sales realizations, including Ciputra Development ($CTRA), Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua ($PANI), Summarecon Agung ($SMRA), Alam Sutera Realty ($ASRI), Bangun Kosambi Sukses ($CBDK), and Pakuwon Jati ($PWON). During 2024, several issuers exceeded their marketing-sales targets, such as ASRI (113%) and PWON (104%). The issuers that met their marketing-sales targets were CTRA and PANI. Notably, PANI revised its marketing-sales target upward from IDR 5.5 trillion to IDR 6 trillion, as we had anticipated in the 1H24 analysis (see https://snips.stockbit.com/snips-terbaru/sektor-properti-kompilasi-marketing-sales-1h24#:~:text=Sementara%20itu%2C%20marketing%20sales%20PANI%20berpeluang%20melebihi%20target%202024%2C%20sehingga%20perseroan%20berpotensi%20merevisi%20naik%20target%20mereka.). In contrast, the marketing-sales realizations of CBDK and SMRA fell short of their targets, reaching 82% and 87% of target respectively. Of the six issuers, two have already announced 2025 marketing-sales targets: SMRA at IDR 5 trillion (a 14.5% increase over the 2024 realization) and PWON at IDR 1.8 trillion (a 15.8% increase over the 2024 realization). \n\nKey Takeaway: Although 2024 was an election year, residential property developers were able to maintain or post year-on-year growth in marketing-sales. We believe the results can be linked to the 100% Value-Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive that was in force for ten months (January-June and September-December). Several issuers reported the contribution of the PPN DTP to total marketing-sales in 2024, namely PWON at 59% and CTRA at 27%. For 2025, we assess that the positive sentiment for the sector can continue with the extension of the 100% PPN DTP until June 2025, after which the rate will fall to 50% for July-December 2025. Bloomberg consensus estimates that the BI Rate will be cut another 50 basis points, twice, to 5.25% by the end of 2025.",

      "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve kept its policy rate unchanged at 4.25%–4.5% at its meeting on Wednesday, 29 January, in line with consensus expectations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is not in a hurry to cut rates, adding that the pause is intended to assess the impact of the 2024 rate-cut cycle on inflation. Powell also noted that the U.S. economy remains strong and that rates are no longer as restrictive as before. The robust U.S. economy, together with a solid labour market, gives the Fed time to evaluate how President Donald Trump’s policies might affect the economy.",

      "content": "Kpler estimates that China’s seaborne coal imports in January 2025 fell to 27.97 million tonnes, a 26% month-on-month decline and the lowest level in almost four years. Historically, China’s coal imports usually weaken in January and February as the winter peak ends, but the estimated drop is far larger than the January 2024 decline of 9% MoM and the January 2023 decline of 10.9% MoM, pressured by higher domestic supply. The price impact was evident as Argus reported that Indonesian thermal coal (4,200 kcal/kg) traded at US$48.76 per tonne in the week to 24 January 2025, the lowest level since April 2021.",
