      "title": "OECD Again Cuts RI Economic Growth Outlook",
      "content": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) again cut its projection for Indonesia's economic growth to +4.7% YoY in 2025 and +4.8% YoY in 2026 in an outlook released in early June 2025, respectively 0.2 percentage point lower than the outlook in March 2025. This also marks the second downward revision for Indonesia this year, following the downgrade in March 2025.\nBesides the outlook for Indonesia's economic growth, OECD again cut the projection for global economic growth to +2.9% YoY in 2025 and 2026, which is 0.2 and 0.1 percentage point lower, respectively, than the outlook in March 2025. This marked the second downward revision of the global economic growth outlook by the OECD after March 2025, influenced by risks of significant slowdowns in several advanced economies - such as the US, Canada, and Mexico - along with increasing trade barriers and geopolitical uncertainties.\nAlthough the weakening global economic growth also puts additional pressure on developing countries, OECD confirmed that the downgrade in Indonesia's economic growth outlook is mainly due to domestic factors, not the direct impact of US import tariff policies. OECD stated that Indonesia's export contribution to the US is less than 2% of Indonesia's GDP, making the direct influence of US tariff policies quite limited.\nSpecifically, OECD noted that private consumption and investment in Indonesia will be suppressed in the first half of 2025, along with weakening business and consumer sentiment, uncertainty in fiscal policy direction, and high borrowing costs. On the external side, increasing global trade tensions and declining commodity prices are also expected to burden Indonesian exports, reflected in BPS data showing an export contraction of -10.77% MoM in April 2025.\nOECD projects domestic demand in Indonesia will gradually recover in 2H25 to 2026. OECD also forecasts inflation in Indonesia will move towards 2.3% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, following the expiration of electricity tariff discounts and the effect of Rupiah depreciation. Furthermore, public investment spending through Danantara IDR is considered to have potential as an investment recovery catalyst. However, OECD also warns of additional risks from potential capital outflows from Indonesia, due to both global and domestic uncertainties. This pressure could suppress the Rupiah exchange rate, widen the current account deficit, and increase the risk of imported inflation.\nIn 2025 itself, the government is targeting economic growth of +5.2% YoY. However, Indonesia's economic growth in 1Q25 only reached +4.87% YoY (vs 1Q24: +5.11% YoY, 4Q24: +5.02% YoY) - lower than the government's 2025 target of +5.2% YoY - with household consumption slowing to +4.89% YoY (vs 1Q24: +4.91% YoY). Following this data, Bank Indonesia cut its economic growth target for 2025 from +4.7-5.5% to +4.6-5.4%, marking the central bank's second downgrade this year.",

      "content": "We assess that the impact of the second round of the government's economic stimulus package launched during the June-July 2025 school holiday period may be a key factor in maintaining short-term economic growth. In the long term, we assess that Indonesia's economic growth will be influenced by several factors, such as the acceleration of government spending, the utilization and management of Danantara investment funds, the prospect of interest rate cuts to encourage economic growth, and improved investment climate following trade war de-escalation. Having a diversified portfolio across various asset classes can help minimize the impact of market volatility, especially amid risks of economic slowdown. With the prospect of future interest rate cuts to boost economic growth, investors can consider investing in short-tenor government bonds that still offer attractive risk-reward:\n1. SR022-T3 (3-year tenor, yield 6.45%)\n2. PBS003 (approx. 2-year tenor, yield approx. 5.93%)\n3. PBS032 (approx. 1-year tenor, yield approx. 5.73%)",

      "content": "Macquarie Analyst, Jim Lennon, stated that the oversupply in the global nickel market is expected to persist until 2027-2028 as demand growth slows amid capacity expansion. Nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange recently hit a 5-year low, dropping to US$13,865 per ton on April 7, 2025, before creeping up to US$15,380 per ton on Thursday (5/6). Lennon stated that the US$15,000 per ton level is a crucial level for producers, considering half of existing producers will risk losses if nickel prices remain below that level. Nickel demand growth is slowing due to the surge in the use of its substitute, the cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries. Reuters reported that the analyst consensus has cut the estimate for nickel demand in the battery sector in 2030 to only 967,000 tons (vs. 2024 realization: 518,000 tons), much lower than the consensus estimate made 2 years ago at 1.5 million tons.",
