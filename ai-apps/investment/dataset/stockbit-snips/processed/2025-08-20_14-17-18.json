      "title": "BI Rate Cut to 5%, Beyond Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (20/8) cut the BI Rate by 25 bps to the 5% level, exceeding consensus expectations which predicted no change. The deposit facility and lending facility were also cut by 25 bps each to 4.25% and 5.75% respectively. With this decision, BI has cut the BI Rate by 100 bps since the beginning of 2025. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this step was taken to boost economic growth amid a stable Rupiah exchange rate and inflation projections remaining low within the 1.5-3.5% target range. Perry added that his team would continue to monitor the possibility of further interest rate reductions to support higher economic growth. Bloomberg reported that the decision to cut interest rates for two consecutive months amidst 2Q25 economic growth surpassing expectations indicates that Bank Indonesia is directing its policy closer to the government's future target, where the Draft State Budget (RAPBN) 2026 targets economic growth of +5.4% YoY. This target is higher compared to the realization during 1H25 at +4.99% YoY and the 2025 APBN outlook in the range of +4.7-5% YoY. Perry mentioned that his team currently projects Indonesia's economic growth throughout 2025 to reach +5.1% YoY, placing it above the central bank's midpoint projection range of +4.6-5.4% YoY. This statement marks a change in language compared to the July 2025 meeting when Perry only mentioned the growth range. Responding to this announcement, the IHSG closed stronger by +1.03% on Wednesday (20/8), with the 10-year government bond yield relatively flat at 6.402% (-1 bps) and the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakening by -0.15% to 16,270. Key Takeaway: The trend of interest rate cuts and expectations of accelerated government spending have the potential to increase economic growth starting from 2H25. Bank Indonesia itself forecasts that The Fed will still cut interest rates 2 more times until the end of this year, each by 25 bps, which could provide room for a further BI Rate reduction. Sectorally, financial services (+1.18%) and property (+2.56%), which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements, strengthened in today's trading, Wednesday (20/8).",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia recorded that banking credit growth slowed down to +7.03% YoY in 7M25 (vs. 1H25: +7.77% YoY), marking the weakest growth since March 2022 and lower than Bank Indonesia's downgraded 2025 target range of +8-11% YoY. Based on usage, investment credit during 7M25 grew by +12.42% YoY (vs. 1H25: +12.53% YoY), while consumer credit was +8.11% YoY (vs. 1H25: +8.49% YoY) and working capital was +3.08% YoY (vs. 1H25: +4.45% YoY). Meanwhile, Sharia financing in 1H25 grew by +8.31% YoY (vs. 1H25: +8.37% YoY) and MSME credit growth reached +1.82% YoY (vs. 1H25: +2.18% YoY). The Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramics Association, Edy Suyanto, told Bisnis on Tuesday (19/8) that its members potentially stand to halt 50% of production capacity if gas suppliers continue to limit the usage of certain natural gas prices (HGBT) at the 48% level and impose a surcharge of 17.8 US dollars per MMBtu. For context, this surcharge price is approximately +20% higher than the regasified gas price of 14.8 US dollars per MMBtu. Edy explained that gas suppliers impose a higher surcharge citing force majeure. Previously, Edy explained that the ceramics industry in West Java experienced a reduction in HGBT gas allocation from 60% to 48% following restrictions imposed by Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS) from August 13-31, 2025. Elnusa ($ELSA) announced it has signed an agreement with Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) to increase the credit facility ceiling from 50 million US dollars with a 12-month tenor to 70 million US dollars with a 24-month tenor. BUMA Internasional Grup ($DOID) through its business entity, PT Bukit Makmur Internasional, announced receipt of a notification letter from Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU) that the agreement to purchase metallurgical coal assets from Anglo American (LON: AAL) was canceled due to a failure to reach an agreement regarding material adverse change. Previously, in November 2024, DOID announced an agreement to purchase a 51% stake in a metallurgical coal mine in Dawson Complex, Australia, for 455 million US dollars from Peabody Energy Corporation. This transaction is part of Anglo American's divestment of remaining metallurgical coal assets to Peabody Energy, where Peabody Energy will only transfer the Dawson Complex to PT Bukit Makmur Internasional after completing the transaction with Anglo American. Tirta Mahakam Resources ($TIRT) plans to change its main business from the plywood industry to the sea transportation industry. To support this step, the company plans to purchase 10 sets of tugboat and barge fleets worth 162.1 billion rupiah from an affiliated party. The financing for this transaction will use a loan facility of up to 200 billion rupiah from PT Harita Jayaraya, the company's controller. This plan will be discussed at the GMS Extraordinary Meeting on September 25, 2025. Cakra Buana Resources Energi ($CBRE) plans to conduct a rights issue of up to 48 billion new shares, with the proceeds intended for partial debt repayment through the execution of convertible bonds, working capital, and capex in the form of fleet additions. The execution price has not yet been announced. This plan will be discussed at the GMS Extraordinary Meeting on September 25, 2025. Previously, CBRE had signed an agreement to purchase 1 unit of a pipe-laying and lifting vessel worth 100 million US dollars or approximately 1.6 trillion rupiah for the diversification of the company's business portfolio into the offshore support vessel segment.",

BBCA explained that the transaction value refers to BBCA's market value on the IDX during the strategic private placement process, which was in the range of 10 trillion rupiah. BBCA also emphasized that the transaction was carried out through a tender process conducted by the government through the National Bank Liquidity Assistance Agency. The clarification from BBCA emerged after an economist from Gadjah Mada University, Sasmito Hadinegoro, suspected there was manipulation in the 51% BBCA share transaction. Sasmito assessed that the transaction was below the book value of the company's assets at that time, which reached 117 trillion rupiah. Separately, Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, on Tuesday (19/8) denied rumors that his party planned to acquire a majority stake in BBCA.",
