This outlook revision is supported by the recovery in services consumption and exports in early 2024. Meanwhile, China's economy in 2025 is projected to grow by +4.3% YoY, unchanged from the outlook in April 2024. The lower growth projection for 2025 is based on the continuous weakening of the property market, low consumer and investor confidence, as well as structural challenges such as population aging and global tensions.",

      "content": "Logindo Samudramakmur (LEAD) plans to conduct a private placement of 1.75 billion new shares at an exercise price of 186 rupiah per share to convert debt amounting to 20 million US dollars. This corporate action is intended to improve the company's financial structure and will dilute existing share ownership by 30.17%. PT Jalan Terang Samudra, OCP Asia Fund IV (SF1) Pte. Ltd., and OCP Asia Fund V (SF1) Pte. Ltd. will subscribe to the new LEAD shares, with their post-transaction ownership percentages becoming 23.19%, 2.59%, and 4.39%, respectively. Previously, these three entities did not hold any shares in LEAD. This plan will be discussed at the EGMS on November 14, 2024. Referring to the 1H24 balance sheet, this debt conversion will reduce LEAD's total debt by 20 million US dollars to 74.6 million US dollars, while equity will increase from 23.5 million US dollars to 43.5 million US dollars. With cash reserves of 7.6 million US dollars, the company's Net Debt-to-Equity Ratio will decrease from 3.69x to 1.54x. Key Takeaway: We assess this corporate action as a positive sentiment for LEAD, considering the high exercise price alongside the prospect of improved financial structure. In the last 2 years, LEAD has been unable to record positive net profit due to large interest expenses, even though the offshore supply vessel (OSV) sector has recovered and the company has successfully booked revenue growth. Assuming the converted debt has an interest rate equivalent to the blended interest rate as of 1H24, LEAD has the potential to experience a reduction in finance costs of approximately 1.7 million US dollars per year. This reduction in finance costs has the potential to drive LEAD to record a net profit of 1.25 million US dollars per FY24 annualized. Using an exchange rate assumption for the Indonesian Rupiah against the US Dollar of 15,900, this net profit is equivalent to an EPS of 3.46 rupiah per share based on the post-transaction share count. With this performance and the new share count, LEAD has the potential to trade at a P/E FY24 annualized of 33.8x. Following the announcement of this debt conversion plan, LEAD's stock price surged +26.5% to 148 rupiah per share on Wednesday (9/10). This headline was released earlier in Stockbit Commentary.",
