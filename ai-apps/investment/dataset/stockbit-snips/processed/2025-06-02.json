      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump said on Friday, 30 May, that he plans to double import tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50%. The announcement came a few hours after Trump accused China of violating an agreement with the US to mutually remove tariffs and restrictions on important mineral trade.\\n2. BPS recorded that Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) eased to 1.6% year-on-year in May 2025 (versus 1.95% in April 2025), below the consensus expectation of 1.94% YoY. On a monthly basis, Indonesia experienced deflation of 0.37% MoM (versus 1.17% inflation in April), lower than the consensus forecast of a 0.01% MoM deflation. Core inflation fell to a four-month low of 2.4% YoY (versus 2.5% in April), also below the consensus of 2.5% YoY.\\n3. S&P Global reported that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 47.4 in May 2025 (versus 46.7 in April), indicating a second consecutive month of contraction. New orders contracted at the fastest pace since August 2021 and export sales fell sharply, especially to the United States.\\n4. China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that China's manufacturing PMI was 49.5 in May 2025 (versus 49 in April), matching consensus expectations and marking a second month of contraction. Output recovered as trade-war tensions eased and the Chinese government continued to stimulate domestic demand. Business confidence improved to 52.5 after reaching a seven-month low of 52.1 in April 2025.\\n5. Indonesia's trade surplus shrank dramatically to USD 0.15 billion in April 2025 (versus a surplus of USD 2.72 billion in April 2024 and USD 4.33 billion in March 2025), the lowest since April 2020. The decline was driven by a surge in non-energy imports, which rose 21.84% YoY, the highest increase since September 2022, while exports grew only 5.76% YoY, in line with expectations. Over the first four months of 2025, the trade surplus was USD 11.07 billion (versus USD 10.97 billion in the same period of 2024).\\n6. Commodity-trade analysis firm Kpler reported that Indonesia's thermal coal exports fell 12% YoY in the first five months of 2025 to 188 million tonnes, the lowest level since the first five months of 2022. Exports to China dropped 23% YoY (more than 20 million tonnes) and exports to India fell 14% YoY (more than 6.5 million tonnes). The decline was caused by higher domestic production in those importing countries, reducing their demand for Indonesian coal. Kpler also noted that Indonesia lost sales to eight of its top ten coal-importing countries as global consumer demand and manufacturing activity weakened.\\n7. Bloomberg reported that Tsingshan Holding Group Co. Ltd. reduced its stainless-steel production in Indonesia's Morowali Industrial Park starting early May 2025. The cut is expected to support stainless-steel prices but could put downward pressure on nickel prices. Both commodities reached five-year lows in April 2025. Tsingshan accounts for almost one-third of global stainless-steel production in 2024, according to Macquarie Group.\\n8. BPS recorded that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia reached 4.33 million during the first four months of 2025, a 5.6% YoY increase, aligning with the government’s 2025 target range of 14-16 million visitors.",

      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded net profit (bank only) of 3.9 trillion rupiah in April 2025, down 3% year-on-year and 13% month-on-month. This result caused the net profit (bank only) for the first four months of 2025 (4M25) to fall 16% year-on-year to 15 trillion rupiah, below the consensus estimate for consolidated 2025 growth of minus 2.8% year-on-year.\\nCredit growth remains challenging. Credit disbursement (bank only) for BBRI stayed low at +4.2% year-on-year during 4M25 (versus 3M25: +3.8% YoY, 4M24: +12% YoY), below the management’s consolidated 2025 guidance of +7-9% YoY. As previously noted, the ongoing restructuring of the micro-segment has reduced micro-credit disbursement by 3% YoY in 1Q25.\\nNet interest income (NII) stagnated, credit cost remains high. Top-line, NII growth was essentially flat at -1% YoY during 4M25. The +4% YoY credit growth did not translate into interest income growth because yields were lower due to the weak micro segment. Non-interest income rose +5% YoY amid operating expenses that jumped +21% YoY. Consequently, pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) fell -8% YoY in 4M25.\\nProvision expenses fell -28% YoY in April 2025 due to a high-base effect, but rose +2% YoY over 4M25 because of a management provision overlay applied in January 2025. This resulted in cost of credit (CoC) at 3.52% for 4M25 (versus 3.61% in 4M24), higher than the management’s consolidated 2025 guidance.\\nKey takeaway: Overall, BBRI’s performance in 4M25 is similar to 1Q25, with micro-segment challenges causing NII stagnation and elevated CoC, while rising opex also draws attention.",

The profit decline was mainly driven by a loss from an associate entity of 20 million US dollars (versus a profit of 230 thousand US dollars in 4Q24) due to a sharp increase in loss from Amman Mineral International (AMMN) to 138.8 million US dollars (versus a loss of 80 million US dollars in 4Q24). Operationally, MEDC’s operating profit grew +1.2% quarter-on-quarter to 182 million US dollars, in line with the consensus estimate (24.9% of the 2025 consensus) and above the analyst’s own estimate (27.6% of the 2025 consensus). MEDC recorded declines in oil and gas production of -2.5% and -4.6% quarter-on-quarter respectively, with oil average selling price at 72 US dollars per barrel (down 0.2% QoQ) and gas ASP at 7.1 US dollars per MMBtu (flat QoQ).",
