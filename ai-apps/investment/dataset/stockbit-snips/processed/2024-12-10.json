      "content": "Reuters reported that Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. (OCBC Singapore) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB Malaysia) are competing to acquire the controlling shares of Bank Pan Indonesia (PNBN). Reuters sources said OCBC Singapore and CIMB Malaysia have submitted a non‑binding offer for the shares offered by ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. and the Gunawan family, with the offer expected to expire this month. In addition to OCBC Singapore and CIMB Malaysia, Reuters also mentioned that Maybank Group Malaysia, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) are interested in buying PNBN. PNBN has not commented on the issue, while OCBC Singapore, CIMB Malaysia, Maybank Malaysia, MUFG, and SMBC declined to comment. Previously, Bloomberg and Reuters reported that the Gunawan family and ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. were considering selling their ownership in PNBN. Together they own 85.74% of PNBN shares, with the Gunawan family holding 46.52% and ANZ holding 39.22%. The combined value of their shares was approximately IDR 39 trillion based on the market close on Tuesday, 10 December. Key Takeaway: If the acquisition materialises, the buyer – either OCBC Singapore or CIMB Malaysia – could consolidate PNBN into their existing banking unit, i.e., Bank CIMB Niaga (BNGA) if bought by CIMB Malaysia, or Bank OCBC NISP (NISP) if bought by OCBC Singapore. Indonesian banking regulations require a single‑presence policy, meaning a controlling shareholder may own only one bank or multiple banks under a consolidation scheme (merger, absorption, integration, or a Joint Business Group). On the day of the report, PNBN shares closed up 5.8% at IDR 2,010 per share.",
