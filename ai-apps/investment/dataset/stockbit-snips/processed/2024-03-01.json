      "title": "Indonesia Inflation Rises to 2.75% Amid Rice Price Surge",
      "content": "The Indonesian Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded an increase to 2.75% year-on-year (YoY) in February 2024, up from 2.57% YoY in January, surpassing the consensus expectation of 2.6% YoY and marking the highest level since November 2023. The inflation rise in February 2024 was driven by higher staple food prices, such as rice, which rose +5.32% month-on-month (MoM) and +19.28% YoY. The rice price surge occurred amid rising paddy prices at the farmer level. The Bureau of Statistics (BPS) noted that dry paddy harvest prices increased +4.86% MoM and +27.14% YoY in February 2024, while milled dry paddy prices rose +6.13% MoM and +33.48% YoY. In addition to rice, the Deputy Head of BPS Production Statistics, M. Habibullah, said chicken meat, chili, and sugar prices were also major contributors to February inflation. According to Danamon Bank economist Irman Faiz, the food price increase in February was also driven by seasonal patterns ahead of Ramadan. On a monthly basis, CPI inflation reached 0.37% MoM in February 2024 (vs. 0.04% MoM in January). Core inflation in February was 1.68% YoY (vs. expectation of 1.71% YoY), stable compared to the previous month and the lowest since December 2021. Since the start of the year, Indonesia's CPI inflation reached 0.34% year-to-date (YTD) by February 2024. Bank Indonesia targets inflation for 2024 in the range of 1.5%-3.5%. The government expects rice prices to start falling as rice import quotas increase from 2 million tons to 3.6 million tons in 2024 and as the main harvest season begins in March 2024. Successful containment of rice prices to more normal levels will reduce inflationary pressure. Conversely, if rice prices remain high, it could suppress consumer purchasing power and negatively affect consumer-focused issuers, especially those targeting lower-middle-income segments.
