      "title": "US Markets & Bitcoin Hit All-Time High",
      "content": "Two major US indices – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq – recorded new all-time highs on Thursday trading (10 July). The S&P 500 closed at 6,280.46, up 0.27%, and the Nasdaq closed at 20,630.67, up 0.09%. The rise was partly driven by a 1.22% increase in Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) shares, marking the first public company to reach a market capitalisation of US$4 trillion. Around the same time, Bitcoin also reached an all-time high of approximately US$118,000 as investors returned to risk-on positions.\n\nThe rally in US equities and Bitcoin was mainly caused by most traders ignoring the trade-tariff concerns announced by President Donald Trump. Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said that most market participants do not pay attention to tariff news until the tariffs are actually implemented, because they can still be renegotiated, postponed or modified for reasonable reasons.\n\nIn Asian markets, South Korea’s KOSPI also posted an all-time high on Friday (11 July) and has risen 32.4% year-to-date, making it the best-performing Asian market since the start of the year. Below is the performance ranking of Asian markets, including Indonesia, ordered from highest to lowest:\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nOverall, the rally in the US and South Korean markets was driven by strong enthusiasm for artificial-intelligence (AI) trends, which appeared to outweigh concerns about US tariff policy. For Indonesia, concerns over economic fundamentals and national growth prospects have kept foreign investor interest low, in our view. We assess that accelerated government spending in the second half of 2025 will be a key factor to boost the economy in the short term. In addition, investors should closely monitor the development of Indonesia-US trade agreements.",

      "content": "1. Reuters reported that the multi-currency loan facility up to USD 10 billion obtained by Danantara from several foreign banks carries an interest rate equivalent to the yield of Indonesian government bonds, with a three-year tenor. Five foreign banks have been appointed as coordinators for the facility, which will become the largest loan ever in Southeast Asia, each committing to lend USD 1 billion unsecured and without government guarantees.\n\n2. The Deputy Minister of Coordinating Ministry for Food, Tatang Yuliono, said that the state-owned bank consortium (Himbara) will provide loans with a ceiling of IDR 3 billion per village cooperative in Merah Putih in the form of goods procurement, not cash, to prevent potential fraud in cooperative management. Meanwhile, the Minister of Cooperatives, Budi Arie Setiadi, stated that President Prabowo Subianto targets about 80,000 Merah Putih village cooperatives to be fully operational by December 2025.\n\n3. Nickel ore shipments from the Philippines to Indonesia are expected to surge this year to meet smelter demand due to production restrictions in Indonesia, according to Tulsi Das Reyes, President of DCMI Mining. Reyes told Bloomberg that Philippine nickel ore exports to Indonesia could increase to around 5-10 million tonnes in 2025, up from the 2023 realization of about 1 million tonnes. He estimates the increase may not last long but could remain stable.\n\n4. Danantara announced on Friday (11 July) that it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to jointly finance renewable energy projects, water management, and power transmission in Indonesia. No further details were provided.\n\n5. Bloomberg reported that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecasts Indonesia’s aluminium production could increase five-fold by the end of the decade as Chinese conglomerates such as Tsingshan Holding Group, China Hongqiao Group, and Shandong Nanshan Aluminum invest in new smelters. Alan Clark, a director at metal consultancy CM Group, told Bloomberg that Indonesia will become a global aluminium industry hub within five years, supported by cheap labour and coal-fired power plants capable of supplying large smelters.\n\n6. Dana Brata Luhur (TEBE) announced that Dian Heryandi and Hendy Narindra Dewantoro have submitted resignation letters from their positions as President Director and Director of the company, respectively. The plan will be discussed at the shareholders’ meeting on 13 August 2025.\n\n7. Jaya Real Property (JRPT) plans to conduct a share buyback of up to 100 million shares (approximately 0.78%) between 10 July and 9 October 2025, allocating IDR 80 billion for the buyback. The plan does not require shareholders’ meeting approval, following OJK’s relaxation to support market stability. Previously, JRPT reported a buyback period from 9 April to 8 July 2025, during which it purchased 23.3 million shares at an average price of IDR 708 per share, totaling IDR 16.5 billion.",
