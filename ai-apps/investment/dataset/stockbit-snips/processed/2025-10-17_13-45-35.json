      "content": "The IHSG plunged -2.57% on Friday (10/17) to the level of 7,916, driven by the continued weakening in conglomerate stocks, with 5 stocks contributing to the decline including DSSA (-13.8%), BREN (-5.10%), BRPT (-7.12%), CUAN (-9.66%), and MLPT (-15%). This decline caused the IHSG to fall -4.14% over the last week. Year-to-date, the IHSG is still up +11.8% YTD, mainly driven by the rise in conglomerate stocks. This is reflected in the performance difference between the IHSG and indices dominated by blue-chip stocks, such as the LQ45. While the IHSG strengthened year-to-date, the LQ45 index actually declined -6.57% YTD, with the performance gap between the two indices widening since mid-2025. However, over the last week, the performance of blue-chip stocks began to outperform conglomerate stocks, with the LQ45 index only declining -2.68% compared to the IHSG's -4.14%, in line with profit-taking actions on conglomerate stocks.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "As we wrote in the Stockbit Commentary, with the massive increase in conglomerate stock prices, we assess that investors can rotate or rebalance into several blue-chip stocks to manage portfolio risk-reward. We see consumer and banking as options for investors, considering their valuations are already at historically low levels. Generally, valuations of issuers in the consumer sector are discounted by more than -1 standard deviation below the historical average, while valuations of issuers in the banking sector are nearly -2 standard deviations below the historical average. We assess that the potential risk of further decline in these two sectors is relatively limited, with continued foreign outflow being one of the main risks we see. Conversely, if profit-taking actions on conglomerate stocks continue, the upside potential offered by the consumer and banking sectors is quite attractive, in our opinion. In the table above, you can see the valuations of several consumer and big bank stocks, along with calculations of the potential upside from valuation recovery to certain levels. Fundamentally, the consumer sector has a relatively better net profit growth outlook in 2025-2026F compared to big banks, with ICBP, INDF, and KLBF being the most prominent in this aspect. Meanwhile, big banks—except BBCA—potentially experience profit declines in 2025F before recovering in 2026F, but this is compensated by a relatively higher dividend yield prospect compared to the consumer sector. In the short term, we expect the release of 3Q25 performance results to generally be the bottom, and recovery will begin in 4Q25.",

      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Friday (10/17) that the government will disburse additional cash assistance totaling 30 trillion rupiah to more than 35 million families in the October-December 2025 period. In addition, the government will help finance internships for 100,000 new university graduates. Previously, the government released a stimulus package totaling 61 trillion rupiah in the first half of 2025 to support declining domestic demand. Gold prices in the spot market briefly surged +1.23% to $4,379.93 per troy ounce on Friday (10/17), marking a new all-time high, before settling around ~$4,343 per troy ounce. The strengthening of gold prices today continued the gold price surge of +2.83% to $4,326.58 per troy ounce at the close of Thursday (10/16). The recent rise in gold prices is supported by increased demand for safe-haven assets amid expectations of The Fed's interest rate cuts and concerns over deteriorating trade relations between the US and China. The Ministry of Investment and Downstreaming noted that investment realization in Indonesia in 3Q25 reached 491.4 trillion rupiah (+13.9% YoY, +2.9% QoQ). This result brought investment realization during 9M25 to 1,434.3 trillion rupiah (+13.7% YoY), equivalent to ~75% of the 2025 target of 1,905.6 trillion rupiah, absorbing 1.96 million workers. Investment realization in 3Q25 was supported by domestic capital investment growth of +40.5% YoY to 279.4 trillion rupiah. Meanwhile, foreign capital investment in 3Q25 contracted -8.9% YoY to 212 trillion rupiah, marking an annual contraction for 2 consecutive quarters and a sharper decline than in 2Q25 (-6.9% YoY). Cumulatively over 9M25, foreign capital investment contracted -1.5% YoY. The Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Rosan Roeslani, mentioned that geopolitical tensions and trade wars are some factors hindering foreign capital investment. Rosan also added that Indonesia will focus on attracting foreign investment to other sectors next year, such as marine, forestry, and plantation sectors. The Head of the Financial Services Authority (OJK), Inarno Djajadi, stated on Friday (10/17) that the authority will strengthen its supervisory function and enhance early detection of unusual transactions or those potentially violating regulations. Inarno added that OJK will increase synergy with Self Regulatory Organizations (SROs) and market players, and strengthen coordination with law enforcement officials to ensure market discipline enforcement, eradication of manipulative practices, and optimal investor protection. Inarno's statement followed the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, affirming that the government will not tolerate market manipulators or 'stock gorengan' (pump-and-dump) practices. Purbaya also encouraged that proven guilty parties be subject to legal sanctions by the relevant authorities. International Financing Review reported that PT Anugrah Neo Energy Materials plans to begin pre-marketing for an IPO on the IDX with a target fund acquisition ranging from 400-700 million US dollars, with a listing target in December 2025. The Head of the National Nutrition Agency, Dadan Hindayana, told Reuters on Thursday (10/16) that his agency estimates the number of recipients of the Free Nutritious Meal program will only reach 70 million people by the end of 2025 due to the limitation in the number of public kitchens, which is about -15% lower than the 2025 target of 83 million recipients. Previously, the National Nutrition Agency estimated that budget absorption for the Free Nutritious Meal program would only reach 99 trillion rupiah by the end of 2025, lower than the revised budget ceiling of 171 trillion rupiah. Due to this low absorption, the National Nutrition Agency stated it would return 70 trillion rupiah of the budget to the government. In 2026, the allocation for the Free Nutritious Meal program will reach 335 trillion rupiah, according to Reuters' report. The CEO of Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, stated that his party is currently discussing with stakeholders—including PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI), relevant ministries, and China's National Development and Reform Commission—to restructure the debt of the Whoosh high-speed rail project. The study of the debt settlement plan is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025.",
