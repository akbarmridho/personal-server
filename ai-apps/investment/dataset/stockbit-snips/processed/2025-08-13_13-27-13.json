      "title": "Foreign Inflow Continues, IHSG Nearing 8,000",
      "content": "The IHSG strengthened +1.3% to the level of 7,892.9 today, Wednesday (13/8), along with the continuation of foreign fund inflows amounting to ~1.5 trillion rupiah. This realization marks a net foreign inflow for 3 consecutive days in the IHSG since the beginning of this week, including an inflow of 2.2 trillion rupiah on Tuesday (12/8) which marked the highest daily inflow since May 14, 2025. Since the beginning of 2025, the IHSG still records a net foreign outflow of 57.3 trillion rupiah as of Wednesday (13/8). The entry of foreign funds into the IHSG pushed up the prices of blue chip stocks since the beginning of this week, with BBRI +10.3%, BMRI +4.3%, BBCA +7.5%, BBNI +7.4%, ASII +5.2%, and TLKM +14.3%. This foreign inflow and the rise in blue chip stocks followed the increase in conglomerate group stocks following the MSCI announcement on Friday (8/8), where DSSA and CUAN were included in the MSCI Indonesia Global Standard. The rise in the aforementioned stocks brought the IHSG closer to the 8,000 level, aligning with the optimism of the IDX President Director, Iman Rachman, who said that the IHSG could break through the 8,000 level on the 80th anniversary of the Republic of Indonesia. Positive sentiment came from the global sphere along with strengthening expectations for a Fed interest rate cut - following weak US labor market data releases and US inflation data that were relatively in line with expectations - as well as the extension of the US-China trade negotiation period. As of Wednesday (13/8), the probability of a 25 bps interest rate cut at the September 2025 meeting was at 96.2%, based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. Until the end of the year, the probability of a minimum 50 bps US interest rate cut stands at 93.7%, slightly increasing compared to last week at 92.7%. Foreign inflow into the Indonesian capital market had already occurred earlier in the government bond market, reflected in the yield of the 10-year government bond declining to the level of 6.406% as of today, having dropped by -0.175 percentage point MTD. The Rupiah exchange rate also strengthened to 16,195 per today, marking a strengthening of +1.8% MTD. Key Takeaway: We assess that the sustainability of the foreign inflow going forward will depend, among other things, on the improvement of Indonesia's economic fundamentals. In the short term, we see that investors will focus on the potential acceleration of government spending in 2H25. Globally, investors need to monitor the developments regarding the impact of US tariff policies which began to be implemented in August 2025, considering their potential influence on inflation and the direction of The Fed's interest rate policy.",
