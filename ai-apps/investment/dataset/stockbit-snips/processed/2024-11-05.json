      "content": "Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew +1.5% quarter-on-quarter and +4.95% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2024 (versus Q2 2024: +5.05% YoY), lower than the consensus expectations of +1.6% QoQ and +5% YoY. This result marks the slowest annual economic growth since Q3 2023 and brings the 9-month (9M24) growth to only +5.03% YoY, below the government target of +5.2% YoY.\\n\\nOn the expenditure side, domestic consumption – which contributed 2.55 percentage points to annual economic growth in Q3 2024 – weakened slightly to +4.91% YoY (versus Q2 2024: +4.93% YoY).\\n\\nExports (+9.09% YoY versus Q2 2024: +8.28% YoY) grew at a lower pace than imports (+11.47% YoY versus Q2 2024: +7.79% YoY), causing net exports to contribute a negative 0.08 percentage points to annual growth in Q3 2024.\\n\\nGovernment spending (+4.62% YoY versus Q2 2024: +1.42% YoY) and gross fixed capital formation (+5.15% YoY versus Q2 2024: +4.43% YoY) both accelerated in Q3 2024, contributing 0.32 and 1.63 percentage points respectively to annual growth.\\n\\nSpatially, the weaker growth was driven by the islands of Java and Sumatra, where growth rates were only +4.92% YoY and +4.48% YoY respectively in Q3 2024, far below the rates in Maluku and Papua (+6% YoY), Sulawesi (+5.87% YoY), Bali and Nusa Tenggara (+5.28% YoY), and Kalimantan (+5.2% YoY).\\n\\nThe GDP release came only a few days after the BPS announced that Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) inflation slowed to 1.71% in October 2024 (versus September 2024: 1.84% YoY), the lowest level since October 2021.",

      "content": "The weak inflation trend and economic growth that fell short of expectations may indicate a weakening of consumer purchasing power, leading to a down-trading phenomenon as we wrote in Stockbit Snips. This phenomenon can be a positive catalyst for consumer-oriented issuers that position their products in the \"value\" segment, such as Tempo Scan Pacific ($TSPC). We have also released an Unboxing of TSPC that you can read here.\\n\\nNevertheless, we observe a shift in the drivers of growth from Java and Sumatra to other islands. This trend is also visible in retail issuers – such as $ACES (as we wrote here) and $MIDI – which are experiencing more significant growth outside Java, and their future strategies are expected to become more expansionary beyond Java.",
