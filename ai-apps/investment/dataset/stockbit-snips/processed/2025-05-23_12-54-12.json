      "title": "US House Passes Trump Tax & Spending Bill, Dollar Under Pressure",
      "content": "The US House of Representatives, controlled by the Republican Party, on Thursday (22/5) passed the tax and spending bill for President Donald Trump's cabinet. The bill will fulfill many of Trump's populist campaign promises, such as tax cuts for individuals and corporations, increased military spending, law enforcement at the nation's borders, and ending clean energy incentives from the era of President Biden. After being passed by the House, the tax and spending bill will be submitted to the US Senate - which is also controlled by the Republican Party - to be passed into law. The bill will increase the US government debt by approximately 3.8 trillion US dollars over the next decade, adding to investor concerns about US solvency levels. Last week, rating agency Moody's lowered the US government's credit rating from Aaa with a negative outlook to Aa1 with a stable outlook, marking Moody's first downgrade of the US government rating since 1917. Prior to Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's had also lowered US debt ratings in 2023 and 2021, respectively. Currently, the US government debt stands at 36.2 trillion rupiah. Interest payments on the US government debt contributed 12.5% of total US expenditures in 2024 and are predicted to increase to 16.7% over the next 10 years. Concerns regarding US government debt again put pressure on the US Dollar Index (DXY), falling -0.6% to the 99.36 level in trading today, Friday (23/5). Year-to-date, the DXY has weakened by -8.4% YTD. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US government bond was flat at the 4.528% level today. Domestically, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar strengthened by +0.67% to the 16,217 level, and the IHSG rose +0.66% to 7,214.16 with a foreign inflow of 589 billion rupiah today. The yield on the 10-year Indonesian government bond fell -2 bps to the 6.828% level.",

      "content": "The trend of the weakening US dollar is projected to potentially push the strengthening of the rupiah exchange rate even below the 16,000 level in 4Q25, which could be followed by a continuation of foreign inflow into the IHSG. The increase in the IHSG driven by foreign inflow will generally have a positive impact on the Big 4 Banks â€“ namely, BBCA, BMRI, BBNI, BBRI. In terms of performance, the strengthening of the rupiah will positively impact issuers that have a large portion of imports/dollar-denominated debt, such as ICBP, KLBF, and MAPI.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that OPEC+ members are considering an oil production increase in July 2025, with the final decision to be made at the meeting on June 1, 2025. OPEC+ delegates stated they are considering an option to increase production by 411,000 barrels per day in July 2025, which is 3 times the originally planned amount. However, no final agreement has been reached regarding the amount of the production increase. Reuters reported that since April 2025, OPEC+ has planned to increase production by a total of 960,000 barrels per day, equivalent to 44% of the 2.2 million barrels per day production cut. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, on Friday (23/5) inaugurated several echelon I officials of the Ministry of Finance, including Lieutenant General (Ret.) Djaka Budi Utama as Director General of Customs and Excise and Bimo Wijayanto as Director General of Taxes. Kontan previously reported that the appointments of Djaka and Bimo were direct choices by President Prabowo Subianto. Djaka currently serves as the principal secretary at the State Intelligence Agency, while Bimo serves as an independent commissioner at Phapros (PEHA). The European Union designated Indonesia as a standard risk country under the anti-deforestation law, which means Indonesian exporters will avoid the strictest compliance checks on goods exported to Europe. The EU's anti-deforestation law will impose due diligence requirements on various exports, including soybeans, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, and chocolate. Bank Indonesia noted that the growth of economic liquidity or broad money supply (M2) in April 2025 slowed to +5.2% YoY (vs. Mar 2025: +6.1% YoY) reaching 9,390 trillion rupiah. Shell Indonesia on Friday (23/5) announced it has reached an agreement to transfer its gas station business in Indonesia to a joint venture owned by Citadel Pacific Ltd. and Sefas Group. This agreement is expected to be finalized in 2026 and does not include Shell Indonesia's lubricant business. Soho Global Health (SOHO) along with its subsidiary, PT Soho Industri Pharmasi, sold its entire ownership (3.27%) stake in PT AstraZeneca Indonesia for 1.84 million US dollars. Sinergi Inti Andalan Prima (INET) announced that Setyanto Hantoro has submitted his resignation letter from his position as President Commissioner of the company on April 11, 2025. This step was taken by Setyanto as he joins BPI Danantara as managing director. Setyanto's resignation will be discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders on June 12, 2025.",
