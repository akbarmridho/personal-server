      "content": "Finance Minister, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, said on Tuesday (9/30) that he is optimistic Indonesian economic growth in 4Q25 can reach +5.5% YoY. This growth, according to Purbaya, will occur across various sectors (across the board), although it will primarily be seen in the property sector - in line with increased credit disbursement from banking - and the food and beverage sector due to increased economic activity. In line with Purbaya, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, also expressed optimism regarding economic growth in 4Q25, which he said will be driven by government spending including fiscal stimulus during the Christmas and New Year holiday period worth approximately 2 billion US dollars or ~30 trillion rupiah. For comparison, the Bloomberg consensus survey in September 2025 predicted that Indonesian economic growth in 4Q25 would only reach +4.7% YoY. On a separate occasion, Purbaya also affirmed that he would not consider easing the fiscal deficit limit until the Indonesian economy can grow faster with more efficient spending. Meanwhile, on Wednesday (10/1), BPS released inflation and trade balance data that exceeded consensus expectations. Indonesian inflation in September 2025 was recorded at 2.65% YoY (vs. August 2025: 2.31% YoY, September 2024: 1.84% YoY), higher than the consensus expectation of 2.5% YoY. Meanwhile, core inflation was recorded at 2.19% YoY in September 2025 (vs. August 2025: 2.17% YoY inflation, September 2024: 2.09% YoY inflation), slightly lower than the consensus expectation of 2.2% YoY. Furthermore, Indonesia's trade balance surplus reached 5.49 billion US dollars in August 2025 (vs. July 2025: 4.17 billion US dollars, August 2024: 2.76 billion US dollars), exceeding the consensus expectation which projected a surplus of 3.99 billion US dollars. This result was driven by export growth of +5.78% YoY in August 2025, exceeding the consensus expectation of +5% YoY. Meanwhile, imports in August 2025 fell by -6.56% YoY, lower than the consensus expectation of -2% YoY.",

Therefore, investors need to monitor the impact of various government initiatives - such as liquidity injection, fiscal stimulus, to increased government spending in general - and the Bank Indonesia interest rate cut.

      "content": "The US officially experienced a government shutdown as of Wednesday (10/1) early morning local time, following the Senate's failure to pass the federal budget bill. This marks the first US government shutdown since 2018-2019. A government shutdown can cause some US government services to temporarily halt. Bloomberg reported that OPEC+ is considering the option of accelerating oil production increases by approximately 500,000 barrels per day in the meeting on October 5, 2025. This amount is higher than previous Reuters reports, which mentioned that OPEC+ in the meeting would most likely decide on a production increase of at least 137,000 barrels per day starting from November 2025. Bloomberg sources said that OPEC+ in the meeting would accelerate the production recovery from voluntary cuts totaling approximately 1.66 million barrels per day, which was initially targeted to end only at the end of 2026. One of the options being considered is increasing monthly production by approximately 500,000 barrels per day over 3 months, although the final decision on this matter is not yet final. S&P Global noted that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slowed to 50.4 in September 2025 (vs. September 2024: 49.2), marking two consecutive months of factory activity expansion despite being down from August 2025 at 51.5, which was the highest level in the last 5 months. S&P Global Market Intelligence Economist, Usamah Bhatti, in his report said that this result was driven by an increase in new demand, although production volume decreased compared to the previous month because companies recorded a decline in client purchasing power. Bhatti added that companies are confident that the improvement in demand conditions at the end of 3Q25 will continue into next year, while manufacturing sector confidence related to output for the next 12 months has also strengthened to its highest level in the last 4 months. S&P Global noted that China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.2 in September 2025 (vs. August 2025: 50.5; September 2024: 49.3), exceeding the consensus expectation of 50.3 while marking the highest level since March 2025. This result was driven by output growing at the fastest pace in the last 3 months, while new export orders rose for the first time in the last 6 months. In addition, new business experienced expansion at the fastest pace since February 2025, which boosted purchasing activity to grow at the fastest rate since November 2024. Going forward, business sentiment improved amid expectations of increased sales and production, supported by business development efforts and Chinese government policies. Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, said on Tuesday (9/30) that his party would launch 33 waste-to-energy power plant (PSEL) projects, 8 of which will be launched at the end of October 2025. Danantara will also open tenders for private parties interested in participating in this project. Rosan explained that each PSEL will manage at least 1,000 tons of waste per day to generate 15 MW of electricity for 20,000 households. Danantara projects that each PSEL unit with an input capacity of 1,000 tons of waste per day requires 4-5 hectares of land, with an investment cost ranging from 2-3 trillion rupiah per project. BPS noted that the number of foreign tourist visits to Indonesia reached approximately 1.5 million people in August 2025 (+12.3% YoY, +1.6% MoM). This result causes the cumulative number of foreign tourist visits during 8M25 to grow by +10.4% YoY to approximately 10 million people, equivalent to 63-72% of the government's 2025 target in the range of 14-16 million people.",
