      "title": "Effective VAT for General Goods & Services Remains 11%",
      "content": "The Government announced on Tuesday (31/12) several important points regarding the increase of Value Added Tax (VAT) effective 1 January 2025. The VAT rate will rise from 11% to 12% only for luxury goods as listed in Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 15/2023 and Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 42/2022. Goods and services that have been exempt from VAT will not change. General goods and services that have been subject to an 11% VAT will not experience an effective increase, so the VAT rate remains 11% of the selling price. Technically, the government does not cancel the 12% VAT rate for general goods and services, but applies a tax base (DPP) equal to 11/12 of the selling price or import value, as regulated in Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 131/2024. This makes the effective VAT on general goods and services stay at 11% of the selling price. For illustration, a general good sold for 10 million rupiah will have a tax base of 9.17 million rupiah (11/12 * 10 million). Applying a 12% VAT on that base yields a total VAT of 1.1 million rupiah, which is exactly 11% of the selling price. Therefore, the effective VAT rate is 11% despite the statutory rate being 12%. The simulation shows that the amount of VAT paid for general goods and services remains unchanged. The announcement also cancels the written statement from the Directorate General of Taxes dated 21 December 2024 that claimed the VAT increase to 12% applied to all goods and services previously taxed at 11%, except for bulk cooking oil 'Minyakita', wheat flour, and industrial sugar. Additionally, the government confirmed that the stimulus package announced on 16 December 2024 will continue to be in effect.",
