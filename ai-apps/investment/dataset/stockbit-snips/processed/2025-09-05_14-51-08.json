      "title": "BI Projects Indonesian Economy to Grow +5.3% in 2026",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that they predict Indonesia's economic growth in 2026 will range between +4.7-5.5% YoY, with a tendency to be at the +5.3% YoY level in line with falling interest rates. This projection is higher compared to Bank Indonesia's projection for Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 at the +5.1% YoY level.\n\nWhen compared with other institutions, Bank Indonesia's projection for 2026 is lower than the government's target in the 2026 State Budget Draft (RAPBN 2026) at the +5.4% YoY level, but higher than the Bloomberg consensus survey in August 2025 at +4.9% YoY and the IMF projection in July 2025 at +4.8% YoY.\n\nIn line with this economic growth projection, Perry stated that they expect banking credit growth to be in the range of +9-12% YoY in 2026, higher than the projection of +8-11% YoY this year.\n\nThe 2026 economic growth projection is based on monetary and fiscal policy directions:\n1. Monetary Policy - Perry mentioned that Bank Indonesia continues to look for room to cut interest rates further given low inflation, a stable rupiah, and the need to boost economic growth. The Bloomberg consensus also expects a BI Rate cut of -25 bps again to the 4.75% level by the end of 2025 and a further cut of -25 bps throughout 2026.\n2. Fiscal Policy - Based on the 2026 RAPBN, consumption and investment are expected to be the drivers of economic growth, with consumption projected to grow +5.2% YoY (vs. 2025 APBN outlook: +4.7-5% YoY) and investment expected to grow +5.2% YoY (vs. 2025 APBN outlook: +4.5-4.7% YoY). Priority programs in the 2026 RAPBN focus on supporting purchasing power, which includes the Free Nutritious Meal program, Red and White Village Cooperatives, as well as food and energy security. To support government program financing, Bank Indonesia has signed a new burden sharing agreement with the government, although there are no details yet on how long this scheme will last and how much government bonds will be borne by Bank Indonesia. Meanwhile, investment is expected to be boosted by the presence of Danantara.\n\nTo support spending, the 2026 RAPBN targets state revenue to increase by +9.8% YoY, supported by a +13% YoY increase in tax revenue. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, affirmed that the government will not impose new taxes or raise tax rates in 2026, but rather encourage improvements in taxpayer compliance.",

      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, stated that he will immediately file an appeal to the Supreme Court as early as Wednesday (3/9) local time regarding the reciprocal tariff dispute. Trump's statement came after the US Federal High Court on Friday (29/8) last week ruled that reciprocal tariffs were a violation of Trump's emergency power usage as president. Nevertheless, the US Federal High Court did not annul the implementation of Trump's reciprocal tariffs, where these tariffs will remain in effect until at least October 14, 2025, to give the US government time to file an appeal to the Supreme Court. As context, 6 out of 9 judges at the US Supreme Court are currently appointed by the Republican Party, so Trump still has a chance to maintain his reciprocal tariff policy.\nThe US labor statistics bureau noted that job vacancies in the US in July 2025 dropped by 176,000 to 7.18 million, marking the lowest level since September 2024 and far below the consensus expectation of 7.4 million. Furthermore, the number of job vacancies in June 2025 was revised down by 80,000 compared to previous estimates to 7.36 million. The US labor statistics bureau also revised up the number of people laid off in June 2025 by 192,000 compared to previous estimates to ~1.8 million.\nA Bloomberg survey estimates that palm oil stocks in Malaysia rose by +2.8% MoM in August 2025 to 2.17 million tons, marking the highest level since December 2023, continuing the upward monthly trend for the last 6 months. Meanwhile, crude palm oil production in Malaysia in August 2025 is estimated to have increased by +2.2% MoM to 1.85 million tons, marking the highest level in the last 1 year, while exports are expected to surge by +11% MoM to 1.45 million tons. The increase in palm oil supply in Malaysia could weigh down the benchmark CPO futures price, especially during the current high production cycle which usually peaks in October.\nKompas reported that the Attorney General's Office on Thursday (4/9) named the former Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, Nadiem Makarim, a suspect in an alleged corruption case involving the procurement of Chromebook-based laptops. The Head of the Legal Information Center of the Attorney General's Office, Anang Supriatna, said that Nadiem was named a suspect after they examined approximately 120 witnesses and 4 experts in this case.",
