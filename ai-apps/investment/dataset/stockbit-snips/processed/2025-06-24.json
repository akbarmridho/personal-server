      "title": "Israel Accuses Iran of Violating Ceasefire",
      "content": "Head of Israel Defense Forces Staff, Eyal Zamir, said on Tuesday (24/6) that Israel will respond to Iran \"with violence\" after accusing Iran of violating the ceasefire agreement. Previously, the US government together with Qatar on Monday (23/6) night tried to push Israel and Iran to achieve a ceasefire by stopping their attacks, according to Axios. Axios continued that both parties had agreed to the ceasefire before US President Donald Trump announced it that same night. However, Israel accused Iran of violating the agreement, claiming it detected a missile launch from Iran after the ceasefire. On the other side, Iranian military and state media denied the accusation. Although Israel threatened to respond \"with violence\", Trump announced on Tuesday (24/6) that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is officially in effect. Responding to recent developments, Brent futures for the August 2025 contract moved volatile throughout Tuesday (24/6) trading. Nevertheless, the intraday price on Tuesday (24/6) at $69.1 per barrel (down 3.3%) in the afternoon continued the decline of 7.2% on Monday (23/6), following Iran's step of not closing the Strait of Hormuz and news of the ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, equity markets reacted positively on Tuesday (24/6) with the Nikkei up 1.16%, the SSE up 1.15% and the Indonesian Composite Index (IHSG) up 1.21%. S&P Futures rose 0.74% in the afternoon after the S&P 500 rose 1% on Monday (23/6) local time. Gold price fell 1.26% to 3,327 per Tuesday afternoon. Key Takeaway: The significant oil price drop caused a correction of several oil-related stocks such as ENRG (down 9.33%), MEDC (down 8.97%) and ELSA (down 5.20%) on Tuesday (24/6) after a rally since the conflict began. Meanwhile, the still positive market movement amid ceasefire violation accusations indicates optimism that the de-escalation progress is generally moving in a positive direction.",
