Airlangga claimed that the tariff exemption for these three commodities would take effect after both parties reach a final agreement, but no schedule has been set as the US is busy with tariff negotiations with other countries.

      "content": "XLSmart Telecom Sejahtera (EXCL) recorded a net loss of 1.6 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: profit 385 billion rupiah, 2Q24: profit 484 billion rupiah). This result caused EXCL's net loss for 1H25 to reach 1.2 trillion rupiah (vs. 1H24: profit 1 trillion rupiah), below the 2025F consensus expectation which projected a net profit of 1.5 trillion rupiah. Here are some of our important notes: Number of Subscribers Increased to 82.6 Million Operationally, EXCL recorded 82.6 million mobile subscribers in 2Q25 (+41% YoY, +40% QoQ), below the initial estimate of the subscriber base at the level of 94.5 million. EXCL management explained that the lower subscriber base compared to estimates was due to the harmonization of subscriber definitions post-merger. The mobile average revenue per user (ARPU) decreased to 36 thousand rupiah in 2Q25 (-14% YoY, -5% QoQ) due to the lower ARPU of Smartfren subscribers (2024: 24 thousand rupiah) compared to XL Axiata (2024: 43 thousand rupiah). Increased Costs Across All Post-Merger Expenses The quarterly net loss in 2Q25 was caused by an increase in all expenses being more aggressive than revenue growth. The main expense increase came from salary and employee expenses reaching 1.1 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (+139% YoY, +114% QoQ) due to increased headcount, and infrastructure expenses of 3 trillion rupiah (+39% YoY, +29% QoQ) due to an increase in the number of sites and regulatory costs from additional spectrum obtained post-merger. All these expenses pushed EXCL's after-tax loss to 1.6 trillion rupiah in 2Q25. Nevertheless, EXCL reported that the company still recorded a normalized profit after tax of 313 billion rupiah in 2Q25 (-36% YoY, -19% QoQ) if one ignores one-off expenses such as integration costs (379 billion rupiah), accelerated depreciation costs (739 billion rupiah), and asset impairment (802 billion rupiah). The asset impairment recorded in 2Q25 originated from assets held for the 900 MHz frequency, which EXCL is obligated to return at the end of 2026. 2025 Guidance: EBITDA Margin Around 40-45% Following the post-merger release, EXCL management announced initial guidance for 2025, targeting revenue growth of +20-30% YoY (vs. 1H25: +12% YoY) and an EBITDA margin of 40-45% (vs. 1H25: 46%). EXCL management also anticipates additional integration costs of 1 trillion rupiah in 2H25 and expects a reduction in opex costs of around 100-200 million US dollars or equivalent to 1.6-3.2 trillion rupiah this year. Key Takeaway Following this financial performance release, EXCL shares fell -6.8% to 2,760 rupiah per share on Wednesday (27/8). We assess that the market reacted negatively due to integration cost realization being greater than market expectations. Going forward, EXCL's performance until the end of 2025 will still be challenging due to several factors: 1) projected additional integration costs of up to 1 trillion rupiah during 2H25; and 2) accelerated depreciation costs will also continue because they relate to 900MHz equipment and assets from legacy vendors. This is also reflected in the EBITDA margin which is still expected to decrease from 46% in 2Q25 to the range of 40-45% throughout 2025, partly due to FREN's lower EBITDA margin.",
