      "title": "US Inflation in Line with Expectations, The Fed Rate Cut On-track",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in the US increased in August 2025 compared to July 2025, although it remained in line with consensus expectations. The growth in US CPI inflation monthly and annually in August 2025 was the fastest inflation increase since January 2025. Here are the details: 1. CPI Inflation MoM: 0.4% (consensus: 0.3%; July 2025: 0.2%) 2. CPI Inflation YoY: 2.9% (consensus: 2.9%; July 2025: 2.7%) 3. Core Inflation MoM: 0.3% (consensus: 0.3%; July 2025: 0.3%) 4. Core Inflation YoY: 3.1% (consensus: 3.1%; July 2025: 3.1%). Meanwhile, in a separate report, initial claims for unemployment benefits (initial jobless claims) increased by 27,000 last week to 263,000, higher than consensus expectations of 235,000. Previously, on September 9, 2025, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that the US economy likely created 911 thousand fewer non-farm payrolls than previous estimates during the 12-month period ending March 2025. This indicates that US job growth had already slowed before the aggressive import tariffs from President Donald Trump. Reuters reported that persistently high inflation amid a weakening labor market is fueling concerns about future US economic uncertainty, particularly regarding stagflation. The weak US labor market reinforces expectations for a Fed rate cut at next week's meeting. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool as of Friday (12/9), the probability for the Fed to cut rates next week reached 100%, with a 25 bps cut probability at 92.7% and a 50 bps cut probability at 7.3%. Responding to the above US inflation data, the US stock market closed higher with the Dow rising +1.36% to an all-time high of 46,108 on Thursday (11/9), while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq strengthened by +0.85% and +0.72% respectively. On the same day, the yield on 10-year US government bonds fell -2.48 bps to ~4.02%. In Indonesia, the IHSG closed higher by +1.37% on Friday (12/9), with the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield falling -5.1 bps to ~6.33% and the Rupiah against the US Dollar strengthening +0.51% to 16,378. Key Takeaway: The increasing certainty of a Fed rate cut potentially opens room for Bank Indonesia to conduct further rate cuts to help boost economic growth. Bloomberg consensus projects the BI Rate will be at 4.75% by the end of 2025, implying one more rate cut. We assess that the government's success in boosting economic growth back up could become a positive catalyst to reverse the foreign outflow trend. The government is currently preparing new stimulus that investors need to watch for details (magnitude, recipient targets, and duration).",
