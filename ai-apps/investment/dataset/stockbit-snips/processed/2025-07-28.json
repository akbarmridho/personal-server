The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that global coal demand will increase slightly by 0.2% year-on-year in 2025, driven by a 7% increase in the United States that offsets a 0.5% decline in China and a 1.6% decline in Europe. The IEA projects global coal demand to fall by 0.2% year-on-year in 2026 to 8.78 billion tonnes (2024 actual 8.79 billion tonnes). Indonesia is expected to record a 10% year-on-year decline in production volume in 2025 to 755 million tonnes.\\n3. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Friday (25/7) that the government agreed to extend the property sector PPN DTP tax discount to 100% for the second half of 2025, instead of the previously planned 50%. He also mentioned other stimulus packages under discussion, including holiday-season discounts for airline tickets, tolls and train tickets, while confirming that electricity tariff discounts will not be part of the stimulus package for the second half of 2025.\\n4. The United States and the European Union reached a trade framework agreement on Sunday (27/7). The deal will impose a 15% tariff on EU exports to the US, including automobiles. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the agreement will bring stability and predictability. US President Donald Trump said the EU also agreed to purchase US energy products worth $750 billion and invest $600 billion in the United States. Bloomberg reported that the 15% tariff will apply to almost all EU exports to the US, but it does not cover steel and aluminium, which will remain subject to a 50% US tariff.\\n5. Nusa Raya Cipta (NRCA) plans to sell or transfer treasury shares resulting from a buy-back, up to approximately 24.8 million shares, between 1 August 2025 and completion.

The sale will be executed through PT Ciptadana Sekuritas Asia at a price in accordance with POJK No. 29/2023. After the transaction is completed, NRCA will no longer hold treasury shares.\\n6. Lippo Cikarang (LPCK) reported marketing sales of 468 billion rupiah in 2Q25, up 13% year-on-year and 45% quarter-on-quarter. This brings 1H25 marketing sales to 791 billion rupiah, up 7% year-on-year, equal to 48% of the 2025 target of 1.65 trillion rupiah. Marketing sales in 1H25 were contributed by the residential segment (52%), commercial (40%) and industrial (8%).\\n7. Shareholders of Lovina Beach Brewery (STRK), PT Barito Mas Sukses, sold 1.6 billion shares (15%) at 15 rupiah per share on 16 July 2025 for a strategic partnership. After the transaction, PT Barito Mas Sukses ownership fell to 61.87%. The shares were sold to Asset Whale Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based consulting and business development firm.

      "title": "AKRA 1H25 Net Profit +18% YoY Beats Expectations",
      "content": "AKR Corporindo (AKRA) recorded a net profit of 615 billion rupiah in 2Q25, up 51% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter. This result makes the net profit for the first half of 2025 (1H25) 1.18 trillion rupiah, an 18% year-on-year increase, surpassing expectations because it equals 47% of the 2025 consensus estimate (the three-year average is 41% of annual net profit) and about 45-49% of management guidance for 2025.\\n1. Trading and Distribution segment pre-tax profit (PBT) grew 30% year-on-year in 1H25. The segment, which contributed about 70% of total FY24 PBT, recovered with a 49% year-on-year increase in 2Q25, leading to a 30% year-on-year growth in 1H25, mainly supported by a low-base effect in 1H24 caused by RKAB permit issues for mining-sector customers.\\nManagement sees potential weakening of fuel demand from mining clients due to declining commodity prices. To mitigate, it will optimise fuel sales to existing industrial (non-mining) clients and the retail segment (bp AKR). Industrial fuel sales remain at a high stable level after new clients acquired in 1H24 become repeat customers.\\nRegarding the change of RKAB duration from every three years to every one year, management says the company is accustomed to the system but is awaiting official regulations from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on implementation details.\\n2. JIIPE land sales grew 21% year-on-year in 1H25. Industrial-zone PBT was 234 billion rupiah in 2Q25 (+114% YoY, +195% QoQ), resulting in a 7% year-on-year increase for 1H25. Growth was driven by JIIPE land sales and higher recurring income from land rentals, electricity and utilities. JIIPE land sales reached 22 hectares in 1H25 (+21% YoY), consistent with management comments in the earnings call for 1Q25. Management expects several new clients to decide on land purchases in 4Q25, similar to previous years, and remains optimistic about a target of 80-100 hectares sold in 2025, supported by a backlog of contracts signed up to 1H25.\\n3. Interim dividend of 50 rupiah per share is planned, amounting to about 990 billion rupiah (~84% of 1H25 net profit). This implies a dividend yield of 3.8% as of Monday 28 July. The cum-date is in the regular market and negotiation on 5 August 2025, with payment on 19 August 2025. In FY2024, AKRA also paid an interim dividend of 50 rupiah per share in August 2024.\\nKey Takeaway: AKRA's performance exceeding expectations in 1H25 keeps optimism that the company can meet its 2025 guidance, based on (1) the guidance being relatively conservative compared with the low-base 2024 net profit decline of 20% YoY, and (2) a solid backlog of land-sale contracts not yet realized in 2024.",

Net profit growth in 2Q25 was driven by: (1) revenue growth of 21% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter, supported by a 33% year-on-year (13% QoQ) increase in the consumer foods segment; and (2) operating margin expansion to 23.6% (2Q24: 19.9%, 1Q25: 20.7%) due to lower administrative and general expenses to 39 billion rupiah (down 26% YoY, 33% QoQ) and a reduced sales-to-revenue ratio to 20.3% (2Q24: 22.5%, 1Q25: 21.3%).",

Net profit growth in 2Q25 was supported by revenue increasing to 1.9 trillion rupiah (+18% YoY, +110% QoQ) and a reduction in the opex-to-sales ratio to 74% (2Q24: 70%, 1Q25: 108%).
