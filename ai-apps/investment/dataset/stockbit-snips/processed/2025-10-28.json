      "content": "The Indonesian government officially released Government Regulation No. 38/2025, which allows the central government to provide loans to regional governments, state-owned enterprises (BUMN), and regional-owned enterprises (BUMD) to support national development projects. The policy aims to provide cheaper financing for infrastructure projects and development programs at the provincial and regency levels. The loans will be funded from the state budget and must be approved by the parliament, and are only granted to borrowers with sound financial conditions. The central government will also impose penalties for late payments, as stipulated in the loan agreements. The regulation follows President Prabowo Subianto's decision to cut the intergovernmental transfer to regions in 2026 by 20% YoY to 693 trillion rupiah to make room for priority programs such as free nutritious meals and increased defense spending.",
