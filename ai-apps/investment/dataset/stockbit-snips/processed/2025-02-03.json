      "title": "Escalation of Trade War Trump Presses Global Markets",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump on Saturday (1/2) announced that he will start imposing import tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico and an additional tariff of 10% on top of existing tariffs for China starting Tuesday (4/2). Trump emphasized that the tariffs will not be lifted until drug trafficking from the three countries to the US stops.\n\nSpecifically, Trump set an import tariff on oil products from Mexico at 25% and from Canada at 10%. The import tariff on energy products from Canada was set lower after considering concerns from US refineries and Midwestern states. Trump also indicated that there will be additional oil and gas tariffs in mid-February 2025, without further details. Previously, Trump on Thursday (30/1) said that his side had not decided whether the announced tariffs would cover oil and gas commodities.\n\nOn the other hand, the imposition of tariffs on China came about a week after Trump mentioned that he could reach a fair trade agreement with China, although he had previously considered a 10% import tariff.\n\nIn response, Mexico and Canada – the United States' two largest trading partners – promised to announce retaliatory tariffs soon. Canada responded with a 25% tariff on US imports worth a total of $155 billion. Meanwhile, China plans to challenge the policy at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and take other retaliatory actions.\n\nFollowing this news, the US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 1.1% to 109.6 in today’s (Monday 3/2) trading, while the Indonesian rupiah weakened by 0.83% to 16,435 per US dollar. The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed down 1.11% at 7,030, and the yield on Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds rose 7 basis points to 7.06%.\n\nOil prices rose, with WTI futures increasing 3.65% to $75.2 per barrel today. The increase was caused by concerns over disrupted crude oil supplies from the two largest supplying countries to the US, while weak demand limited further gains. Gold in the spot market had briefly reached an all-time high of $2,817 per troy ounce on Friday (31/1) driven by safe-haven demand amid global growth concerns and inflation pressure, although it fell 0.09% to $2,796 per troy ounce today.",

      "title": "BBRI Plans Share Buyback up to Rp3 Trillion",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) plans to conduct a share buyback with a funding allocation of up to 3 trillion rupiah. The buyback is expected to take place from 12 March 2025 to 11 March 2026, with the company seeking shareholder approval at the extraordinary general meeting on 11 March 2025. The corporate action will be executed at a price deemed fair by the company in accordance with POJK No. 29/2023. The treasury shares acquired will be used for employee and/or director share ownership programs and the board of commissioners.\n\nS&P Global reported that Indonesia’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in January 2025 (vs. 51.2 in December 2024), indicating two consecutive months of factory activity growth and the strongest pace since May 2024. The result was supported by output increases for three straight months and the strongest rise since May 2024. New orders continued to grow amid rising foreign orders for two consecutive months. Companies also increased purchasing ahead of Ramadan, with employment reaching its highest level in 2.5 years. Sentiment remained positive, backed by expectations of higher output and stable demand and economy.\n\nUS Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3 % month-over-month in December 2024 (vs. 0.1 % in November 2024), matching consensus and marking the highest level since April 2024. Year-over-year, PCE inflation was 2.6 % (vs. 2.4 % in November 2024), the highest in seven months. Core PCE inflation was 0.2 % month-over-month in December 2024 (vs. 0.1 % in November 2024), also matching consensus. Year-over-year, core PCE inflation was 2.8 % (vs. 2.8 % in November 2024), still above the Federal Reserve’s 2 % target.\n\nS&P Global also noted that China’s Manufacturing PMI slipped to 50.1 in January 2025 (vs. 50.5 in December 2024), below the consensus of 50.5. The result marked four consecutive months of factory expansion, albeit the slowest pace in that period, as foreign orders shrank for two months due to rising global trade challenges. Employment fell sharply, the steepest decline since February 2024, and selling prices dropped at the fastest rate since July 2023. Sentiment improved with expectations of business development efforts and supportive government policies, though overall business optimism remained below average because of concerns over US import tariffs.\n\nSpecial Envoy for Climate and Energy, and brother of President Prabowo Subianto, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, said on Friday (31/1) that the government does not plan to implement early retirement for coal-fired power plants (PLTU) in 2040. He clarified that the president’s statement meant the government will not build new PLTU after 2040.\n\nHashim also said the government plans to build nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 4.3 GW, without providing further details. Indonesia’s installed electricity capacity is currently over 90 GW, more than half from coal and less than 15 % from new renewable energy.\n\nBPS reported that Indonesia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to 0.76 % year-over-year in January 2025 (vs. 1.57 % in December 2024), well below the consensus expectation of 1.88 %. Monthly, Indonesia recorded a deflation of 0.76 % (vs. 0.44 % inflation in December 2024), contrary to consensus of 0.32 % inflation. The monthly deflation was driven by electricity tariff subsidies that contributed a 1.47 percentage-point deflation as tariffs were discounted for customers up to 2,200 VA. Core inflation in January 2025 was 2.36 % year-over-year (vs. 2.26 % in December 2024), slightly above the consensus of 2.3 % year-over-year.\n\nBPS also recorded that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia reached 1.24 million in December 2024 (+13.8 % month-over-month, +8.7 % year-over-year). This result brought total international arrivals in 2024 up 19.1 % year-over-year to about 13.9 million, 99.3 % of the government’s 2024 target of 14 million and the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.",
