      "title": "IHSG +5.5% This Week, Starting to Show Signs of Recovery",
      "content": "The IHSG strengthened by +5.5% since the beginning of this week as of Thursday (6/3), after being in a bearish trend with a decline of -21% from its recent peak in mid-September 2024. The strengthening of the IHSG this week raises questions as to whether its downtrend is over and if a rebound can continue, or if it has the potential to fall again. We try to look at historical data of IHSG movements to answer this question. Here are some of our key findings: 1. Historical Average and Range of Decline Similar to Current Decline Level. In the last 20 years, there have been 8 incidents where the IHSG experienced a significant decline. The definition of significant we use is a minimum decline of 15%. Of these incidents, 2 cases were caused by massive crisis declines, namely the Covid-19 pandemic (-38.4%) and the Global Financial Crisis (-61.6%). Excluding these 2 crises, the average decline of the IHSG from the other 6 incidents was -21.4%, with a decline range between 15.8-26.9%. 2. Full Rebound. Out of 8 decline incidents, the IHSG successfully rebounded to the level before the decline occurred, although with a longer duration than the decline duration. There were even 5 incidents where the IHSG managed to rebound to exceed the level before the decline occurred. 3. Trade War Volume I. The IHSG also succeeded in rebounding from the decline related to the first volume trade war during the February-July 2018 period, where this incident has similarities to the current condition. Important notes and disclaimer: - There are 2 significant decline incidents excluded, namely in the 2005 and 2006 periods. This exclusion was made because the IHSG nominal during those periods was below 2,000, so the relevance of the decline was less comparable to the 8 IHSG decline incidents in our table. - Measurement of decline and rebound may contain subjectivity in chart observation. - There is no certainty that the current decline will not turn into a crisis which historically has a massive level of decline. Key Takeaway As a conclusion, if investors assess that the current condition is not a crisis and the prospect of a crisis occurring is not large, history shows that the current IHSG decline has reached/is approaching its end and has the potential to be followed by a significant rebound. *This article was previously published in Stockbit Commentary on Wednesday (6/3) afternoon.",
