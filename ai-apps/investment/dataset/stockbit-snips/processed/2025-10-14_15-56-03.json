      "content": "$CTRA: Ciputra Development recorded marketing sales of approximately 1.9 trillion rupiah in 3Q25 (-28% YoY, -28% QoQ), bringing marketing sales for 9M25 to approximately 7.6 trillion rupiah (-12% YoY). CTRA also revised down its marketing sales target for 2025 from 11 trillion rupiah to 10 trillion rupiah, meaning the achievement for 9M25 reached ~76% of the new 2025 target. The house and land plot segment contributed 88% of total marketing sales during 9M25, followed by the shophouse segment (9%), apartment (3%), and office (1%). Approximately 30% of marketing sales in 9M25 came from products eligible for PPN DTP (VAT Exemptions). $PWON: Pakuwon Jati recorded marketing sales of approximately 300 billion rupiah in 3Q25 (-16% YoY, +10% QoQ). This result brought marketing sales for 9M25 to approximately 903 billion rupiah (-20% YoY), equivalent to ~50% of the 2025 target of 1.8 trillion rupiah. The largest marketing sales contribution came from the condominium segment (57.4%), followed by landed houses (41.5%), and offices (1.2%). 73% of marketing sales in 9M25 came from products eligible for PPN DTP. $ANTM: The Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Tri Winarno, stated that the government is assessing the possibility of applying a Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) scheme for the gold commodity. This plan is aimed at reducing Aneka Tambang's dependence on gold imports, which reach approximately 30 tons per year as raw material for precious metal production. $BBTN: The President Director of Bank Tabungan Negara, Nixon LP Napitupulu, targeted that the government's liquidity injection of 25 trillion rupiah will be fully absorbed by November 2025. Nixon explained that the relatively slow absorption is due to the more complex characteristics of KPR (Mortgage Loans) compared to general credit, starting from the verification stage to credit approval. Furthermore, the disbursed ceiling is smaller because the majority of BBTN's credit portfolio is directed towards the retail segment. According to Nixon, the available credit pipeline has reached 27.5 trillion rupiah across several segments. Nixon's statement came after the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, planned to move 15 trillion rupiah of liquidity fund at BBTN due to low credit disbursement realization at 19% as of October 9, 2025. $ENRG: Energi Mega Persada announced that PT Samuel International has absorbed part of the new shares offered in the private placement.
