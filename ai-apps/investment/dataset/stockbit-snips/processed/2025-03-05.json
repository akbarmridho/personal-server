      "title": "Compilation of Adaro Group Performance 2024",
      "content": "Adaro Group announced its performance for 2024. The details are presented by each listed company:\n\nAdaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI)\n- AADI recorded net profit of US$1.21 billion for 2024, a 5.9% year‑over‑year increase. The result was slightly below our estimate (94.8% of Stockbit estimate) but in line with consensus expectations (98.3% of consensus estimate).\n- Quarterly and annual performance comparison for 4Q24 cannot be made because data for 3Q24 is unavailable as it was still consolidated within Alamtri Resources Indonesia (ADRO).\n- The net profit growth in 2024 was mainly driven by other income that rose about 30 times to US$339 million, together with a profit of US$322.9 million from the sale of the stake in Adaro Minerals Indonesia (ADMR).\n- On the operating side, AADI's revenue fell 10.1% YoY in 2024 due to a decline in average selling price (ASP) of 16.5% YoY, although sales volume grew 7.4% YoY. Cost of goods sold decreased 8% YoY, resulting in a gross profit margin of 27.6% (2023: 29.2%).\n- For 2025, AADI targets thermal coal sales volume of 65‑67 million tonnes, 1.6‑4.5% lower YoY than the 2024 realization, with a stripping ratio of 4.3x (2024: 4.4x). AADI plans capex of US$250‑300 million for 2025.\n\nAlamtri Resources Indonesia (ADRO)\n- ADRO recorded net profit of US$1.38 billion for 2024, a 15.9% YoY decline, in line with consensus expectations (102.5% of consensus).\n- Quarterly and annual performance comparison for 4Q24 cannot be made because pro‑forma 3Q24 data, which would de‑consolidate AADI, is unavailable.\n- The profit decline was caused by a 23.5% YoY drop in revenue from discontinued operations, following the loss of control over AADI after its spin‑off in December 2024. For the 2024 fiscal year, ADRO still recognized revenue from AADI until 6 December 2024. Excluding the AADI profit, ADRO's continuing‑operations net profit fell only 2.4% YoY.\n- Operationally, ADRO's revenue decreased 2.7% YoY in 2024, mainly due to a 12.9% YoY decline in the mining services segment. On the cost side, operating expenses rose 49.4% YoY in 2024, compressing the operating profit margin to 35.3% (2023: 36.2%).\n\nAdaro Minerals Indonesia (ADMR)\n- ADMR recorded net profit of US$105 million in 4Q24, a 25.8% QoQ increase but a 45.1% YoY decline. The full‑year 2024 net profit was US$437 million, down 1% YoY, slightly above consensus (105% of consensus).\n- The quarterly profit rise in 4Q24 was driven by a 33.9% QoQ revenue increase, supported by a 50.8% QoQ volume growth, despite an ASP decline of 11.2% QoQ. However, cost of goods sold rose 35% QoQ and operating expenses rose 69.5% QoQ, lowering the operating margin to 41.5% in 4Q24 (3Q24: 42.7%).\n- For 2025, ADMR targets metallurgical coal sales volume of 5.6‑6.1 million tonnes (2024: 5.6 million tonnes) with a stripping ratio of 3.3x (2024: 3.6x). ADMR plans capex of US$300‑325 million in 2025 (2024 capex: US$600‑700 million).\n\nKey Takeaway\nFor 2025, besides coal price fluctuations, the Adaro Group's performance will be influenced by sales volume and stripping ratio. Based on guidance, AADI's performance may decline due to lower sales targets compared with 2024 while maintaining a stable stripping ratio. ADMR and ADRO are expected to be stable or only slightly weaker, given potential volume growth amid weakening metallurgical coal prices.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that the delayed monthly APBN (state budget) report for January 2025 caused investors to question the government's financial condition. As of Wednesday 5 March, the government had not released the January 2025 APBN balance. The Ministry of Finance said the delay was due to a tight schedule. Normally the government holds a briefing on the APBN position 2‑3 weeks after the end of the month. The January 2025 APBN report is highly anticipated because President Prabowo Subianto issued a budget efficiency instruction for ministries and agencies amounting to 306.7 trillion rupiah in that month.",

His remarks came after the US officially implemented a 25% import tariff on Canada and Mexico, with an exemption for Canadian energy imports that are subject to a 10% tariff.",

      "content": "The International Tin Association reported that the Wa State authority in Myanmar announced its readiness to receive applications for mining and processing licences at the Man Maw tin mine, indicating that the mine could reopen by the end of this year after being suspended in August 2023. Myanmar is the world's third‑largest tin producer after China and Indonesia, and Man Maw was the country's largest tin mine before suspension. However, Reuters metal columnist Andy Home explained that the Wa State announcement is only the first step toward a full reopening, as it will take several months for workers—especially those from China—to obtain work permits and return to Myanmar even after mining licences are granted. Home also argued that the Man Maw reopening will not immediately solve the global tin supply issue, noting that a major tin mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo is facing increased security risks from local rebels.",

ANRPC estimates worldwide natural rubber output in 2025 will grow only 0.3% YoY to 14.9 million tonnes, while demand is projected to increase 1.8% YoY to 15.6 million tonnes. For Indonesia, ANRPC forecasts a 9.8% YoY decline in production to 2.04 million tonnes. Nair explained that the global rubber shortage is caused by low replanting rates due to low prices over the past 7‑8 years, before prices rose to a 13‑year high at the end of 2024.",
