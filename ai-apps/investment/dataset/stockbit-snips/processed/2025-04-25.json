      "title": "AKRA 1Q25: Net Profit -5% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "AKR Corporindo (AKRA) recorded a net profit of IDR 565 billion in 1Q25, down 5% year-over-year (YoY) and down 25% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), representing 23% of the 2025 consensus estimate and about 22-24% of management’s 2025 guidance. No JIIPE land sale occurred in 1Q25, but management indicated a potential land-sale volume of 20-45 ha for 2Q25.\n\n1. **PBT of the Trading and Distribution segment grew +16% YoY** – The profit-before-tax (PBT) from the ‘trading and distribution’ segment, which contributes roughly 65-75% of total PBT, recovered with a +16% YoY increase in 1Q25. Gross profit for this segment also rose +17% YoY, surpassing the 2025 guidance of +5-7% YoY. The improvement was mainly driven by a low-base effect in 1Q24 caused by RKAB permit issues for mining-sector customers.\n\nLooking ahead, AKRA will keep the gross-profit guidance for the trading and distribution segment at +5-7% YoY for 2025, given potential weakening of fuel demand due to softening commodity prices. To offset this, management will optimise revenue from the retail (bp AKR) segment and the chemical raw-material trading segment.\n\n2. **No JIIPE land sale in 1Q25, but 20-45 ha expected in 2Q25** – Although no JIIPE land was sold in 1Q25, AKRA confirmed a sale of 20 ha to Golden Elephant in 2Q25, which will be reflected in the financial statements. This 20 ha sale already exceeds the 1H24 level of 18.1 ha. In addition, AKRA expects an additional 20-25 ha sale in 2Q25. If realised, total JIIPE land sales in 1H25 could reach 40-45 ha, i.e., 40-45% of the 2025 target of 100 ha.\n\nDuring 1Q25, the ‘industrial park’ segment still recorded profit from recurring income such as land rent and electricity/utilities. Management expects recurring income to rise further in coming quarters, driven by higher utilisation at the Xinyi Glass plant and the Freeport copper smelter, which is targeted to resume operations in June 2025.\n\nManagement explained that the US-China trade war escalation creates opportunities, as some Chinese firms will expand abroad to avoid US tariffs.",
