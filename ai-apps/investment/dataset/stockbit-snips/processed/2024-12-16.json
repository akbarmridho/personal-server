      "title": "Economic Policy Package 2025",
      "content": "The government on Monday (16/12) announced a series of economic policy packages and a selective 12% value-added tax (VAT) for 2025. The important notes are as follows:\n\n- Selective 12% VAT: The government said that the increase of VAT to 12% will only be applied to luxury or premium goods and services. Based on the press conference briefing, the items that will be subject to the 12% VAT are:\n  - Premium rice, premium fruits, and premium meat (such as wagyu)\n  - Expensive fish, shrimp, and premium crustaceans (such as king crab)\n  - Premium education services\n  - Premium health services\n  - Electricity tariff for customers with a category of 3,500-6,600 VA\nThe government has not announced a complete list of luxury goods and services that will be subject to the 12% VAT. Meanwhile, the government will bear a 1 percentage point increase in VAT (VAT DTP) for wheat flour, industrial sugar, and cooking oil Minyakita, so their VAT will remain at 11%. Basic food items such as rice, meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, and milk will remain exempt from VAT.\n\n- Food and Electricity Assistance: The government will provide food assistance in the form of rice amounting to 10 kg per month for 2 months (January and February 2025) for 16 million recipients. In addition, the government will also provide a 50% electricity tariff discount for 2 months (January and February 2025) for customers with a category of 2,200 VA or below, covering approximately 80 million customers or about 97% of PLN customers.\n\n- Support for the Labor-Intensive Sector: The government will bear income tax (PPh 21) for workers in the labor‑intensive sector with salaries up to 10 million rupiah per month. In addition, labor‑intensive industries that wish to revitalize machinery will receive a special interest rate incentive of 5%.\n\n- Extension of Property Sector Incentives: The government again extended the 100% VAT DTP exemption for landed houses and apartment units until June 2025. For the period July‑December 2025, the incentive will be reduced to a 50% VAT DTP exemption. The incentive applies to housing with a maximum selling price of 5 billion rupiah for the first 2 billion rupiah.\n\n- Hybrid Car Incentive: The government will bear a 3% luxury vehicle tax (PPnBM) for hybrid cars. Consequently, the PPnBM for hybrid cars will drop from the current 7‑8% to 4‑5%. However, there is still uncertainty regarding a possible increase in the PPnBM for hybrid cars.\n\n- Extension of UMKM Incentive: The government will extend the 0.5% tax exemption for micro, small and medium enterprises (UMKM) with annual turnover up to 4.8 billion rupiah for one additional year, specifically for UMKM that have already enjoyed the maximum 7‑year incentive. With this extension, UMKM that have already received the 7‑year incentive will obtain an additional one‑year duration. For UMKM that are newly receiving the incentive and have been under the program for less than 7 years, the tax incentive will remain at the maximum 7‑year period.\n\n- Tobacco Excise Duty: The government confirmed that it will not raise the tobacco excise duty (CHT) in 2025. It also confirmed that the retail price of cigarettes and electronic cigarettes will be increased in 2025. On average, the retail price of cigarettes will rise by 4% in 2025 (excluding electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products). The cigarette type with the highest percentage increase is hand‑rolled kretek (SKT), especially in groups II and III. Meanwhile, the average retail price of electronic cigarettes will increase by 11% in 2025. These provisions will take effect on 1 January 2025.\n\n- Interest Rate Outlook: Reuters‑surveyed economists expect Bank Indonesia to keep the benchmark BI Rate at 6% in the Governor’s Board meeting on 18 December 2024. This expectation differs from the previous month, when economists anticipated a 25 basis‑point rate cut in December 2024. The shift is driven by the continued weakening of the rupiah against the US dollar. Economists also lowered the expected BI Rate cuts for 2025 from 100 basis points to 75 basis points, considering potential longer‑term dollar strength due to protectionist policies of the newly elected US President Donald Trump.\n\n- Trade Balance: BPS reported that Indonesia’s trade surplus surged to 4.42 billion US dollars in November 2024 (versus 2.48 billion in October 2024 and 2.41 billion in November 2023), exceeding the consensus estimate of 2.21 billion and marking the largest surplus since July 2024. The result was supported by a 9.14% year‑on‑year increase in exports, while imports rose only 0.01% year‑on‑year. Over the first 11 months of 2024, the trade surplus amounted to 28.89 billion US dollars, with exports up 2.06% year‑on‑year and imports up 4.74% year‑on‑year.\n\n- China Retail Sales: China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that retail sales growth slowed to 3% year‑on‑year in November 2024 (down from 4.8% in October 2024), below the consensus forecast of 4.6%. This marks the weakest retail sales growth since August 2024. On a monthly basis, retail sales fell 0.16% in November 2024. Over the first 11 months of 2024, China’s retail sales grew 3.5% year‑on‑year.",

Therefore, investors still need to wait for the official regulation to see the complete list of goods and services that will be subject to the 12% VAT.",
