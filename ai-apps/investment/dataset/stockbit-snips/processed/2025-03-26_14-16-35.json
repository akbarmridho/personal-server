      "title": "Issuer Performance Compilation 2024: Part 1",
      "content": "Most issuers have announced their financial reports for the 2024 fiscal year. In this first part of the issuer performance compilation, we summarize the performance of issuers closely related to consumers, including the banking, consumer staples, dairy, poultry, retail, tobacco, healthcare, and media sectors. The following is a breakdown of revenue, operating profit, and net profit for each sector: Key Takeaway: In general, the performance of most consumer-related sectors was quite good in 4Q24 and throughout FY24, where the total top-line in both periods still grew above +6% YoY. Operating profit margins in 4Q24 and FY24 in total were also relatively stable, causing total operating profit to still grow +5.6% YoY in 4Q24 and +7.2% YoY throughout FY24. The decline in operating profit margins that occurred in the consumer staples, dairy, retail, and tobacco sectors during FY24 could be offset by increases in the banking and poultry sectors. Although top-line and operating profit recorded good performance, net profit in 4Q24 decreased by -1.6% YoY, mainly driven by exchange rate losses from consumer staples companies such as $ICBP accompanying the weakening rupiah exchange rate and increased provisions in several banks. However, total net profit throughout FY24 still grew quite well by +4.8% YoY, mainly driven by the banking, poultry, and dairy sectors. Highlights from the recap of issuer performance by industry include: Nominally, the banking sector remains the largest contributor to net profit growth during FY24. Growth in this sector was mainly driven by $BBCA (+13% YoY) and $NISP (+19% YoY), while net profit from the other 3 big banks only booked growth around +0-3% YoY. Throughout FY24, the banking sector recorded significant credit growth from BBCA and $BMRI, with both exceeding the FY24 guidance from their respective management. However, the surge in provisions from $BBRI became a negative aspect, making it the only big bank that recorded a worse cost of credit (CoC) compared to its management guidance. The poultry sector recorded the highest percentage YoY net profit growth during FY24. This was due to the decrease in the average price of raw materials (corn -5% YoY), as well as the maintained increase in DOC prices (+28% YoY) and broiler (+3% YoY) during FY24. Besides poultry, industries that recorded double-digit net profit growth during FY24 include media, healthcare, and dairy. Meanwhile, industries that recorded a decline in net profit were consumer staples (especially pressured by the decline in $UNVR performance) and tobacco (volume and margin decline due to excise tax increases and downtrading).",
