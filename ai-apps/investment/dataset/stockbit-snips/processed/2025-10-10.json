      "title": "Automotive Sales September 2025: Bottom Level Passed",
      "content": "Gaikindo recorded that national wholesale car sales in September 2025 reached 62,071 units (down 15% YoY, up 0.5% MoM). This realization makes wholesale car sales for the first nine months of 2025 total 561,820 units (down 11% YoY), equal to 62-75% of Gaikindo's 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 units (versus 73% realization in the same period of 2024). Based on brand, the overall market showed a decline, with non-ASII wholesale sales falling -14% YoY and -9% MoM. From the competitor side, BYD+Denza wholesale sales only reached 1,315 units in September 2025 (down 37% YoY, down 54% MoM), marking the first month since January 2025 with monthly wholesale below 2,000 units. In a separate report, the Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded that domestic motorcycle sales in September 2025 reached 567,173 units (up 7.3% YoY, down 1.9% MoM). This result brings motorcycle sales for the first nine months of 2025 to approximately 4.8 million units (down 0.7% YoY), equal to 72-76% of AISI's 2025 target range of 6.4-6.7 million units (versus 77% realization in the same period of 2024). September 2025 is the first month of the year where motorcycle sales grew more than 5% YoY. Key Takeaway: Looking at car and motorcycle sales data for September 2025, we see that automotive sales have passed their lowest level (bottom). This recovery could accelerate further with relatively better macro-economic prospects from government spending acceleration, declining interest rates, and specific government initiatives such as liquidity injections that are beginning to materialize.",

      "content": "OJK is reviewing changes to the minimum free float rule for publicly listed companies, with discussions planned for Q4 2025. Two proposed schemes are: 1) a minimum free float based on market cap for IPO issuers—20% for market cap below 5 trillion IDR, 15% for market cap between 5 and 50 trillion IDR, and 10% for market cap above 50 trillion IDR; and 2) raising the minimum free float for already listed companies from 7.5% to 10% over three years, with periodic reviews for possible gradual increases. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa told CNBC Indonesia that he expects Indonesia's economy to accelerate to 6% YoY in the second half of 2026, with a possible slowdown in Q3 2025 followed by a rebound to 5.5% YoY in Q4 2025. Reuters reported that the minister is confident about a 6% YoY growth in 2026 thanks to a liquidity injection of 200 trillion IDR to state-owned banks, of which 56% has been disbursed as loans by 10 October 2025, supporting a projected 10% YoY growth in bank credit by year-end. Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani announced that the company will launch the first wave of waste-to-energy projects in 10 cities in early November 2025, an increase from the previous plan of 8 projects by the end of October 2025. The total target is 33 projects with an estimated total investment of 91 trillion IDR, and 192 domestic and foreign companies have expressed interest. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources said it is restoring mining business licences (IUP) to a portion of the 190 mines that were suspended in September 2025 after they provided reclamation guarantees and corrected administrative documents.",

In September 2025, ASII reported a wholesale decline of 16% YoY, but a monthly increase of 10% MoM. The better performance was mainly driven by growth in Toyota+Lexus and Daihatsu wholesales, which grew +13% MoM and +8% MoM respectively. Toyota+Lexus again posted monthly wholesales above 20,000 units, after three months previously staying in the 18,000-19,000 range.
