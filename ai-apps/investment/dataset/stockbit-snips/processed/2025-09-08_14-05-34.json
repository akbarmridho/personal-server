      "title": "Sri Mulyani Replaced by Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa as Finance Minister",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto today, Monday (8/9), replaced Sri Mulyani from the position of Finance Minister, a position she has held for almost 14 years in the last 20 years. As her replacement, President Prabowo inaugurated Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, who since 2020 has served as the chairman of the board of commissioners at the Deposit Insurance Corporation (Lembaga Penjamin Simpanan). Following this decision, the IHSG closed down -1.28% at 7,767 today, with the one-month NDF rupiah against the US dollar weakening -1.07% to 16,585 this afternoon. Before the reshuffle today, Sri Mulyani had indeed been frequently rumored to resign from her position. Rumors of Sri Mulyani's resignation resurfaced at the end of August 2025, after a mob looted her house at the peak of demonstrations. The State Secretary Minister, Prasetyo Hadi, in a press conference today only explained that the removal of Sri Mulyani from her position was the prerogative right of the president. According to Bloomberg, Sri Mulyani was a symbol of fiscal credibility for the last 3 Indonesian presidents, widely acknowledged for having helped Indonesia secure investment-grade credit ratings. Meanwhile, Purbaya previously served in government as a deputy at the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment and as a special staffer at the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. Before entering government, Purbaya served as a senior economist at Danareksa Research Institute and President Director of PT Danareksa Sekuritas.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "The reshuffle of the Finance Minister position was responded to negatively by the market, likely due to a perceived increase in uncertainty regarding government fiscal discipline. Some metrics to monitor in the short term are: 1) foreign flow in the bond and stock markets after this reshuffle; and 2) the movement of government bond yields and the rupiah exchange rate. For bond yields, besides movements in the secondary market yields, investors can also monitor the results of primary market auctions scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday (9/9). In the longer term, investors can monitor fiscal policy and its effectiveness in driving economic growth. In the short term, for investors wanting to be more defensive currently, they can consider consumer stocks that have strong balance sheets (net cash/low leverage) and relatively low currency risk, such as SIDO, MYOR, and CMRY.",

      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm payrolls (NFP) in August 2025 only increased by 22,000, below the consensus expectation of 75,000. Meanwhile, the NFP data for July 2025 was revised from an increase of 73,000 to an increase of 79,000. Furthermore, the NFP for the June 2025 period was revised from an increase of 14,000 to a decrease of 13,000, marking the first decline since December 2020. The unemployment rate increased from 4.2% in July 2025 to 4.3% in August 2025, marking the highest level since October 2021. Responding to this employment data, the market currently expects a Fed interest rate cut in September 2025 with a probability of 100%, based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. The Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia on Monday (8/9) stated that burden sharing will be conducted prudently. Under this scheme, Bank Indonesia will pay a higher interest rate on government deposit placements to help fund housing and cooperative programs initiated by President Prabowo Subianto's administration. The Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia stated that this higher interest rate will be paid until the end of the program, although neither detailed the specific interest rate, the amount paid, nor the duration of the program mentioned. This step was taken amid growing concerns about the impact of these programs on the budget. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that the free trade agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA) will be signed on September 23, 2025. Previously, Airlangga stated in June 2025 that the agreement would allow Indonesia to obtain zero tariffs for almost 80% of its export products to the European Union along with the removal of non-tariff barriers. Based on reports from several media outlets, Indonesian commodities subject to tariffs by the European Union include palm oil derivatives with tariff rates around 5-12.8%, biodiesel (palm oil-based) around 8-18%, textiles around 8-12%, and seafood products around 16-20%. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Monday (8/9) that his team targets sales transactions during the 2025 National Online Shopping Day (Harbolnas) to reach 35 trillion rupiah or grow +12.2% YoY compared to the 2024 Harbolnas achievement of 31.2 trillion rupiah. Harbolnas 2025 will be held on December 10-16, 2025. Bank Indonesia noted that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of August 2025 decreased to the level of 150.7 billion US dollars (vs. July 2025: 152 billion US dollars). This development was influenced by government foreign debt payments and the policy of stabilizing the rupiah exchange rate. The position of foreign exchange reserves at the end of August 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.3 months of imports or 6.1 months of imports plus government foreign debt payments.",
