      "content": "Gaikindo noted that national car wholesales in September 2025 reached 62,071 units (-15% YoY, +0.5% MoM). This realization makes car wholesales during 9M25 reach 561,820 units (-11% YoY), equivalent to 62-75% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 9M24: 73% realization in 2024). Based on brands, Astra International recorded a relatively better sales performance compared to all competitors. In September 2025, ASII recorded a wholesale decline of -16% YoY, but increased by +10% MoM. For comparison, total non-ASII wholesales decreased by -14% YoY and -9% MoM. ASII's better performance - especially monthly - was driven by positive wholesale growth in Toyota+Lexus and Daihatsu, which grew by +13% MoM and +8% MoM, respectively. Toyota+Lexus again booked monthly wholesales above 20,000 units, after being only in the range of 18,000-19,000 units in the previous 3 months. Thanks to the positive performance booked by Toyota+Lexus and Daihatsu, ASII's market share increased to 54% in September 2025, recovering from the relatively low levels of 50-52% in June-August 2025. From the perspective of ASII's competitors, we highlight BYD+Denza wholesales which only reached 1,315 units in September 2025 (-37% YoY, -54% MoM), marking monthly wholesales below 2,000 units for the first time since January 2025. In a separate report, the Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) noted that domestic motorcycle sales in September 2025 reached 567,173 units (+7.3% YoY, -1.9% MoM). This result brought domestic motorcycle sales during 9M25 to ~4.8 million units (-0.7% YoY), equivalent to 72-76% of AISI's 2025 target in the range of 6.4-6.7 million units (vs. 9M24: 77% realization in 2024). September 2025 was the first month since the beginning of the year where sales grew by more than +5% YoY.",

      "content": "Looking at car and motorcycle sales data for September 2025, we see that automotive sales have passed their lowest point (bottom). This recovery has the potential to accelerate going forward with a relatively better macro-economic outlook from the acceleration of government spending generally, the trend of declining interest rates, as well as more specific government initiatives such as liquidity injection that is starting to be realized.",

      "content": "Kontan reports that the OJK is currently reviewing changes to the minimum free float rule or the proportion of shares owned by the public in public companies, with this plan to be discussed in Q425. Kontan mentions that there are 2 proposed change schemes: 1) change in minimum free float for IPO issuers based on market cap, including a minimum free float of 20% for issuers with a market cap under five trillion rupiah, 15% for issuers with a market cap above five trillion rupiah up to fifty trillion rupiah, and 10% for issuers with a market cap above fifty trillion rupiah; and 2) change in free float for listed issuers from a minimum of 7.5% to a minimum of 10% within the next 3 years, which will then be reviewed periodically to potentially be increased gradually. Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, told CNBC Indonesia on Friday (10/10) that he is confident economic growth can accelerate up to +6% YoY in 2H26. Purbaya estimates economic growth might slow down in Q325 but will recover to +5.5% YoY in Q425. Previously, Reuters reported on Thursday (9/10) that Purbaya is confident the Indonesian economy can grow +6% YoY in 2026 thanks to a liquidity injection worth 200 trillion rupiah to the state-owned bank holding company (Himbara). These funds have been disbursed by 56% as of October 9, 2025, so the Ministry of Finance is confident that banking credit growth can grow +10% YoY by the end of 2025 (vs. 8M25: +7.56% YoY), in line with the 2025 target that was downgraded by Bank Indonesia in the range of +8-11% YoY. Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, said on Friday (10/10) that his party will hold the initial launch of a waste-to-energy project in 10 cities in early November 2025. Rosan's latest statement differs from his statement last week when he mentioned launching 8 waste-to-energy projects by the end of October 2025. Danantara targets launching a total of 33 waste-to-energy projects, with an estimated total investment value reaching 91 trillion rupiah. Rosan claims that 192 companies - both domestic and foreign - have expressed interest in participating in this project. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Thursday (9/10) that his ministry has begun returning mining business licenses (IUP) to some of the 190 mines that were suspended in September 2025 for failing to provide reclamation guarantees. However, Bahlil did not specify which mines could resume operations. The return of operating licenses occurred after several sanctioned mining companies met their obligations by paying post-mining reclamation guarantee funds and correcting administrative documents, including correcting production reports that exceeded the work plan and budget (RKAB). Geoprima Solusi (GPSO) announced that 45.45% of the company's shares owned by the controller, Karnadi Margaka, will be acquired by PT PIMSF Pulogadung - part of Tjokro Group - which is engaged in mechanical, civil, and fabrication services. The transaction value has not been announced. After this transaction, PT PIMSF Pulogadung - which previously had no shares in GPSO - will become the new controller of the company and carry out a mandatory tender offer. GPSO stated that the share purchase agreement will be signed in the near future.",
