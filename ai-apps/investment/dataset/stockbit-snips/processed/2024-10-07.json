      "title": "US Nonfarm Payrolls Exceed Expectations, Rupiah Pressured",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded a non-farm payroll (NFP) increase of 254,000 in September 2024, exceeding the 12-month average growth of 203,000. This result far surpassed the economists' expectation of 140,000 according to a Reuters survey and marked the strongest growth since March 2024. The September 2024 NFP increase was driven by the food-and-beverage services sector, health, government, social assistance, and construction.\n\nThe unemployment rate for September 2024 fell to 4.1%, lower than the Reuters survey and the August 2024 figure of 4.2%. In addition, the BLS revised July 2024 NFP upward to 144,000 (+61.8%) and August 2024 to 159,000 (+12%), both 72,000 higher than previously reported.\n\nIn response to the data release, market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut by year-end fell from 75 basis points (target range 4.0-4.25%) last week to 50 basis points (target range 4.25-4.5%) on Monday (7 Oct), according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) rose 0.52% to 102.5 and the 10-year Treasury yield rose 20 basis points to 4.0%. U.S. equities reacted positively, with the S&P 500 closing up 0.9%, the Dow Jones up 0.76% and the Nasdaq up 1.22% on Friday (4 Oct) as hard-landing concerns eased.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nFor Indonesia, the development creates negative sentiment for the rupiah and government bonds. The rupiah weakened 1.26% to 15,680 per U.S. dollar on the day (7 Oct), while the 10-year government bond yield rose 8 basis points to 6.73%. The prospect of a smaller Fed rate-cut path could limit the space for Bank Indonesia to cut rates further. Bloomberg’s consensus on 7 Oct 2024 projects that BI will still cut rates by at least 25 basis points by year-end 2024 and at least two 25-basis-point cuts in 2025.",
