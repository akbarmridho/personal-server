      "title": "Car Sales in Feb 2024 Remain Weak; ASII Market Share Rises",
      "content": "Wholesale car sales in Indonesia in February 2024 were recorded at 70,656 units, growing +1.5% MoM, but down -18.8% YoY. The monthly growth was mainly supported by increased sales of car brands under the umbrella of Astra International (ASII), such as Toyota and Daihatsu. Meanwhile, other brands like Wuling (-44.9% MoM), Hyundai (-19.2% MoM), Suzuki (-18.7% MoM), Mitsubishi (-8.4% MoM) experienced a decline. ASII itself recorded wholesale sales of 41,240 units in February 2024, up +8.6% MoM, but down -11.4% YoY annually. Results that were relatively better than the industry average caused ASII's market share to increase to 58.4% in February 2024 (vs. January 2024: 54.6%, February 2023: 53.5%). Cumulatively over 2M24, wholesale car sales in Indonesia only reached 140,275 units, down -22.6% YoY. All brands - except Wuling - experienced a sales decline in 2M24. These results only met 12.7% of the 2024 target set by Gaikindo at 1.1 million units. For comparison, the realization for 2M22 and 2M23 met 15.8% and 18% respectively of the total sales in those years. Marketing Director of PT Toyota-Astra Motor (TAM), Anton Jimmi Suwandy, stated that the weakening car sales at the beginning of 2024 were suppressed by purchase deferrals from retail and business (fleet) consumers approaching the election moment. Furthermore, Bisnis reported that the decline in car sales at the beginning of 2024 was also triggered by the government's delay in extending the government-borne VAT incentive for electric vehicles. For information, electric car sales contributed 3.4% to wholesale car sales in 4Q23. Key Takeaway: Although sales in the coming months have the potential to recover as the election concludes and electric car sales increase, we assess that there is still a risk that the 2024 target of 1.1 million units set by Gaikindo will not be met. Meanwhile, the relatively better sales of ASII were responded to positively by the market, with the company's share price rising +2.43% to 5,275 rupiah per share on Thursday (14/3). Currently, ASII is trading at a valuation of 7.0x 1-Year Forward P/E, equivalent to the valuation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Additionally, ASII also plans to propose a final dividend of 421 rupiah per share, which indicates a final dividend yield of 8% as of Thursday (14/3).",
