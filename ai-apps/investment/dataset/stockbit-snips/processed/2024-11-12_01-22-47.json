      "title": "October 2024 Car Sales Highest During 2024",
      "content": "The Association of Indonesia Automotive Industries (Gaikindo) noted that national car wholesales in October 2024 amounted to 77,191 units (-3.9% YoY, +6.2% MoM), marking the highest monthly sales since the beginning of 2024. Although still lower compared to last year, the level of the YoY decrease is narrowing. This result brought national wholesale sales for 10M24 to 710,408 units (-15% YoY), equivalent to 83.6% of Gaikindo's 2024 target which had been revised down to 850,000 units. The Chairman of Gaikindo, Yohannes Nangoi, stated that they are targeting national car wholesale sales in 2025 to recover to the 1 million unit level along with the trend of falling interest rates and the growth of electric vehicle infrastructure outside of Java and Bali. In October 2024, Astra International (ASII) recorded a sales decline of -1.9% YoY, but this was still better than the industry average decline of -3.9% YoY. This result caused ASII's market share to increase to 56.5% (vs. October 2023: 55.3%). By brand, Daihatsu was the main supporter of ASII car wholesales in October 2024 with stable sales of 14,096 units (-0% YoY, +11.2% MoM), while Toyota+Lexus sales reached 27,211 units (-1.6% YoY, +6.3% MoM). Cumulatively, ASII recorded wholesale of 401,398 units (-13.8% YoY) during 10M24, relatively better than the industry decline. Meanwhile, among ASII's main competitors, Mitsubishi recorded the relatively best performance with sales of 7,900 units (-3.3% YoY, -3.2% MoM) in October 2024, resulting in Mitsubishi's sales during 10M24 reaching 82,187 (-9.3% YoY). On the other hand, ASII's other main competitor, Honda, recorded the most negative performance in October 2024 and 10M24. Meanwhile, BYD successfully recorded sales of 2,488 units in October 2024 with a market share of 3.2%, surpassing Wuling (2.9%) and Hyundai (2.2%). Key Takeaway: We suspect the improving wholesale sales figures, which successfully exceeded 75,000 units in October 2024 - the highest monthly figure during 2024 - may be caused by increasing demand from the corporate fleet segment following political certainty post-cabinet announcement. The stock prices of automotive issuers have already reflected the improving trend in car sales. Therefore, regarding the outlook for automotive issuers going forward, we assess that investors need to pay attention to the wholesale trend in the next 2 months, whether sales figures can be sustained in the range of 75,000-80,000 per month and even improve further. This is necessary to estimate whether the annual sales recovery to the 1 million unit level in 2025 is realistic to achieve or will actually be revised downwards.",
