      "title": "Pemilu Diproyeksikan 1 Putaran, IHSG Perkasa",
      "content": "Presidential and vice-presidential candidate pair, Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka, obtained 56-59% of the vote in the 2024 election, based on quick count results from several survey institutions. Meanwhile, the KPU real count results as of Thursday (15/2) afternoon showed that their vote acquisition was 56.32% out of 43.93% of the votes already counted. Although the calculation results are still preliminary, this large vote difference indicates that the election will most likely be concluded in one round only. These results were welcomed positively by market players and foreign investors, with the IHSG rising +1.3% to the level of 7,303 on Thursday (15/2), where 10 out of 11 sectors strengthened. Based on the preliminary quick count results from Litbang Kompas as of Thursday (15/2), several parties included in the coalition supporting Prabowo-Gibran obtained more than 4% of the vote and are projected to pass into parliament. These parties consist of Golkar (14.47%), Gerindra (13.58%), Demokrat (7.59%), and PAN (7.1%). The total vote share of these four only reached 42.74% and did not reach 50%. PDI-P - which supports candidate pair Ganjar Pranowo and Mahfud MD - obtained the largest legislative election vote share with a result of 16.97%, based on the Litbang Kompas quick count. PDI-P is the only supporting party for Ganjar-Mahfud to obtain more than 4% of the vote. Meanwhile, the 3 supporting parties for Anies Baswedan and Muhaimin Iskandar each received more than 4% of the vote, with PKB at 11.29%, Nasdem at 9.42%, and PKS at 8.36%. Key Takeaway. Various sectors and stocks potentially benefiting from these presidential election results are: Sectors related to Prabowo-Gibran's program plans: Free milk program: ULTJ, CMRY Continuation of the IKN project: PTPP, ADHI, ACST, PANI, PWON Continuation of downstreaming: ANTM, INCO, NCKL Big banks which received foreign inflow: BBCA, BBRI, BMRI, and BBNI. However, it should be noted that these stocks have already received significant foreign fund inflows and their valuations are no longer cheap. Stocks whose shareholders are considered by the market to have affiliations with the Prabowo-Gibran supporting coalition: ADRO, ADMR, MDKA, MBMA, TRIM, ABBA, and MARI. Although the market appears enthusiastic in welcoming the preliminary calculation results, it is important to remember that the impact of this positive sentiment may not last long. Therefore, investors must remain attentive to the fundamentals and valuations of each company. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the new government's decision-making in implementing its programs will depend on the success of the coalition supporting Prabowo-Gibran in embracing other parties in the DPR, considering that the share of votes held by its supporting coalition is still below 50%.",
