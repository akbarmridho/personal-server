      "content": "US stock exchanges continued their decline, with the Nasdaq index down -4.8% WoW, S&P 500 -3.6% WoW, and DJIA -2.6% WoW as of Tuesday (11/3). This drop continues the downward trend in US stock markets that has been ongoing for the previous 2 weeks, driven by investor concerns over potential US recession due to the trade war. The Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, told ABC News that his firm has now raised the probability of a US recession to 35%. In response to the decline in US stock markets, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday (11/3) that people cannot just look at the capital market, a statement contrary to Trump's tendency to use stock market rallies as proof of his success. Trump also warned of potential turmoil during the \"transition period\" of his tenure, as his administration aims to do \"something big\" to bring wealth back to the US. Trump himself frequently alternates in implementing his tariff policies, which trigger global market uncertainty. Most recently, Trump on Tuesday (11/3) threatened to double import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum commodities to 50% after the province of Ontario in Canada announced plans to impose an additional charge on electricity sent to the US. The discussion to double these import tariffs was then canceled by Trump just hours after it was announced, following the cancellation of the Ontario authorities imposing an additional charge on electricity shipments to the US. Meanwhile, the European Union announced today, Wednesday (12/3), that the region will immediately implement retaliatory tariffs against US imports worth 28 billion US dollars. This step follows the US government's action to impose a 25% import tariff on steel and aluminum commodities as of today. The European Union stated that they will end the suspension of import tariffs for the US covering the 2018-2020 period on April 1, 2025, and will impose full import tariffs on the US starting April 13, 2025, but they remain open to negotiation as they believe higher import tariffs will not benefit anyone.",

      "content": "The risk of a US economic recession potentially pressures the global economy, which could negatively impact Indonesia's trade balance due to declining exports. On the other hand, a worsening US economy could open greater room for The Fed to lower US interest rates, which could be followed by a reduction in the BI Rate by Bank Indonesia. The prospect of a Fed interest rate cut has increased recently, where analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of a US interest rate cut of more than 50 bps by the end of 2025 rose to 65.8% as of today from 60.9% a week ago. Furthermore, the worsening US economic outlook could cause an outflow from that country to other countries offering better economic growth prospects.",

      "content": "Bisnis reports that the State Budget (APBN) deficit reached 0.1% of GDP as of January 2025 (vs. Jan 2024: 0.16% surplus of GDP, 2025 APBN target: 2.53% deficit of GDP), based on documents released on the Ministry of Finance website today, Wednesday (12/3). Bisnis reports that the document was no longer available on the Ministry of Finance website as of this afternoon, but the media successfully took a screenshot of the document. Based on the screenshot compiled by Bisnis, the realization of state revenue as of January 2025 fell -28.3% YoY to 157.32 trillion rupiah, fulfilling only 5.24% of the 2025 APBN target. Meanwhile, the realization of state spending as of January 2025 fell -1.9% YoY to 180.77 trillion rupiah, equivalent to 4.99% of the 2025 APBN target. This result caused the primary balance surplus to decline to 10.61 trillion rupiah (vs. Jan 2024: 65.25 trillion rupiah surplus, 2025 APBN target: 63.33 trillion rupiah deficit). Bloomberg reports that the Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, will hold a briefing on the 2025 APBN performance on Thursday (13/3). This briefing will provide an update on the January 2025 APBN performance, which is highly anticipated by the market amidst the government's budget restructuring early this year. The Ministry of Finance usually announces the APBN performance realization 2-3 weeks after the end of the previous month, but the briefing regarding the January 2025 APBN performance has not yet been held due to a busy schedule. On Wednesday (12/3), Bisnis reported that the Ministry of Finance had uploaded documents related to the January 2025 APBN performance, but the documents were subsequently unavailable this afternoon on the same day. The Minister of Manpower, Yassierli, stated on Tuesday (11/3) that the government proposes that the holiday allowance (THR) for online motorcycle taxi (ojol) partners amounts to at least 20% of the partners' average net monthly income over the last 12 months. Yassierli also mentioned that the government requests ride-hailing companies - including GoTo Gojek Tokopedia ($GOTO) and Grab Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: GRAB) - to provide THR for ojol partners in cash, not in kind or other forms. Yassierli also ordered private and State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) companies to disburse THR at least 7 days before (H-7) Eid al-Fitr 2025, with full payment and no installment options.",

      "title": "Government to Revise TNI Law, Expanding Civilian Posts for TNI Personnel",
      "content": "The government and the DPR agreed on Tuesday (11/3) to revise Law No. 34/2004 concerning the TNI, with the discussion of the regulation's amendment focusing on expanding civilian positions for TNI personnel from the current 10 ministries/agencies to 15 ministries/agencies. The Minister of Defense, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, stated that the draft amendment to the TNI Law requires military personnel to first resign from the TNI before filling a civilian position. According to DPR member TB Hasanuddin, the new draft changed from the previous draft which allowed active TNI personnel to fill any government position. This TNI Law revision emerges amidst a trend of placing active and retired TNI officers in State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) during President Prabowo Subianto's tenure. Early this month, Tempo reported that President Prabowo gathered hundreds of TNI colonels in Hambalang, West Java, to receive courses from SBM ITB, FEB UI, and Prasetya Mulya University. Tempo reported that these officers have the potential to occupy managerial positions in BUMN and BUMD. Bank Indonesia estimates that retail sales will contract by -0.5% YoY in February 2025, although they are still projected to grow +0.8% MoM in line with preparations for Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. The annual decline in retail sales in February 2025 is expected to be driven by a decrease in the food, beverage, and tobacco group, although the information and communication equipment group, apparel sub-group, and motor vehicle fuel group are expected to increase. Meanwhile, the realization of retail sales in January 2025 slowed to +0.5% YoY (vs. Dec 2024: +1.8% YoY) and contracted -4.7% MoM (vs. Dec 2024: +5.9% MoM). The monthly contraction in retail sales in January 2025 is in line with normalization after the Christmas and New Year celebrations, which caused a sales contraction in most groups, except for spare parts and accessories. The Government will impose anti-dumping import duties (BMAD) on nylon products from China, Thailand, and Taiwan starting March 25, 2025, based on the latest regulation published on Wednesday (12/3). This policy will be effective for the next 4 years, with import duties ranging from 1,254 to 31,510 rupiah per kg. The BMAD rule emerged after the investigation by the Indonesian Anti-Dumping Committee found that nylon products from these countries had caused losses to the domestic industry. Nylon is used in food and industrial packaging, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and textiles.",
