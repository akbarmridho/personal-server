      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rates, Prediction of Slower FFR Cuts",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (11/20) [decided](https://www.bi.go.id/id/publikasi/ruang-media/news-release/Pages/sp_2625424.aspx) to maintain the benchmark interest rate, BI Rate, at 6%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5.25% and 6.75%, respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision aims to strengthen the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate amid global geopolitical and economic uncertainty, especially with the strengthening of the US dollar following Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Perry mentioned that the weakening of the Rupiah against the US dollar was primarily triggered by the strengthening of the US Dollar Index (DXY) due to the [_inflationary policy plan_](https://snips.stockbit.com/snips-terbaru/indeks-dolar-as-menguat-ke-level-tertinggi-dalam-1-tahun) promoted by Trump. Furthermore, Perry stated that The Fed's interest rate cuts will be limited as the US economy is projected to remain good in 2025. Perry mentioned that BI still expects a Fed rate cut of -25 bps in December 2024. However, for 2025, Bank Indonesia now only expects a Fed rate cut of -50 bps, lower than the previous projection of -75-100 bps. For comparison, Bank Indonesia's latest projection is in line with market expectations from the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). Following the declining expectation for The Fed rate cuts, the Indonesian capital market experienced an outflow. Since the beginning of November 2024, the Indonesian bond market has experienced an outflow of 9 trillion Rupiah as of November 13, 2024, while the outflow in the stock market reached 11 trillion Rupiah as of November 19, 2024. The return of foreign funds exiting the Indonesian capital market triggered a weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar by -0.9% MTD to the level of 15,858 per November 20, 2024. Key Takeaway: To mitigate volatility risks from the uncertainty of interest rate direction, investors can take advantage of the opportunity to lock in high and attractive bond yields, especially for short-term series like PBS032. Additionally, the Retail SBN ST013, which is currently in the [offering period](https://blog.bibit.id/blog-1/investasi-di-st013-dan-raih-passive-income-hingga-rp48-juta-per-bulan), can also be an alternative because it has a floating coupon with a floor.",

Prianto mentioned at least 2 ways the cancellation can be taken by the government: through a Government Regulation in Lieu of Law (Perppu) or by submitting a draft government regulation regarding the change in the 2025 VAT rate along with the submission of the 2025 State Budget Amendment Bill. Prianto's comments came amidst pressure from the public, including labor and business groups, who are asking the government to cancel and/or postpone the VAT increase.",
