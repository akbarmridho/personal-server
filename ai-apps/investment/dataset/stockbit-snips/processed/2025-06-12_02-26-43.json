      "title": "AS-China Get Closer on Final Trade Agreement",
      "content": "US and Chinese governments on Tuesday (10/6) announced that the two countries have agreed on a trade deal framework. This new framework - which resulted from negotiations in London, UK since the beginning of this week - will still be reviewed by the respective presidents of the two countries. US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, stated that the framework will include accelerating the export of rare earth metals and magnets from China for the US automotive and defense industries. Meanwhile, the US will ease the export of a number of its commodities to China, although Lutnick did not elaborate further. The framework agreed upon in London is a continuation of the US and China negotiations for trade tension de-escalation. Previously, the US and China agreed on a tentative agreement last month in Geneva, Switzerland, which included a decrease in import tariffs of each by 115 percentage points over 90 days. Trade tensions between the US and China have put pressure on the Chinese economy. This is reflected in the contraction of China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 48.3 in May 2025 - marking the lowest level since September 2022 - and annual deflation of -0.1% YoY for 4 consecutive months.",

However, the lack of detail on the announced framework, as well as the need for approval from each president, leaves room for uncertainty from this meeting. Therefore, market reactions tended to be muted on Wednesday (10/5) with S&P 500 futures falling -0.28%, SSE rising +0.52%, EuroStoxx 50 falling -0.22%, and the US Dollar Index (DXY) tending to be flat +0.03%.",
