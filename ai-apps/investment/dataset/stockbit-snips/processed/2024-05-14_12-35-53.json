Ryan bases his projection on the unconducive global economic conditions, so most banks will revise their targets downwards. Previously, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) had revised its credit growth guidance from +11-12% YoY to +10-12% YoY, while Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) cut its credit growth guidance from +11-12% YoY to +10-11% YoY.",

      "title": "ASII share price dropped -9.75% on Ex-Date; Opportunity to Collect Minimum 5% Dividend Annually",
      "content": "Astra International's ($ASII) share price dropped -9.75% to 4,580 rupiah per share in trading today, Tuesday (14/5), which was the ex-dividend date. Previously, ASII distributed a final dividend for the 2023 fiscal year amounting to approximately 17 trillion rupiah or 421 rupiah per share, with a payment date on May 30, 2024. This amount indicated a final dividend yield of 8.3% based on the ASII share price during cum-dividend on Monday (13/5) at 5,075 rupiah per share. In addition to the final dividend, ASII had previously distributed an interim dividend of approximately 4 trillion rupiah or 98 rupiah per share in October 2023. Thus, in total, ASII distributed a dividend of 519 rupiah per share from 2023 net profit, equivalent to a 62% dividend payout ratio. As seen in the chart above, the trend of ASII dividend payments has tended to increase since emerging from the pandemic peak in 2020: Before the pandemic (2017-2019), ASII's dividend payout ratio was stable at 40%. Meanwhile, post-2020, the lowest dividend payout ratio was at 48%. ASII's net profit level after the pandemic (since 2022) is also higher compared to the pre-pandemic level. With today's price drop, ASII shares have weakened -18.9% YTD, triggered by various negative sentiments such as the entry of BYD and weak automotive sales. Key Takeaway: We assess that signs of bottoming in car sales figures are needed to start seeing a recovery in ASII share prices. However, in our view, the current share price provides an opportunity to collect ASII as one of the stocks that provides large and consistent dividends. Observing ASII's dividend payment track record, a conservative assumption of 239 rupiah per share, such as in 2021, would result in a dividend yield of 5.2% based on the share price of 4,580 rupiah.",
