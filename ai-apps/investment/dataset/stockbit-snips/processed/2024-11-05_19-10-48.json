      "content": "Indonesian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by +1.5% QoQ and +4.95% YoY in 3Q24 (vs. 2Q24: +5.05% YoY), which was lower than the consensus expectation of +1.6% QoQ and +5% YoY. [These results] mark the slowest annual economic growth since 3Q23 and bring the economic growth for 9M24 to only +5.03% YoY, lower than the government target of +5.2% YoY. From the expenditure side, domestic consumption growth - which contributed 2.55 percentage points to the annual economic growth in 3Q24 - slightly weakened to +4.91% YoY (vs. 2Q24: +4.93% YoY). Meanwhile, exports (+9.09% YoY vs. 2Q24: +8.28% YoY) grew lower than imports (+11.47% YoY vs. 2Q24: +7.79% YoY), causing net exports to contribute negatively by 0.08 percentage point to the annual economic growth in 3Q24. Government spending (+4.62% YoY vs. 2Q24: +1.42% YoY) and gross fixed capital formation (+5.15% YoY vs. 2Q24: +4.43% YoY) experienced increased growth in 3Q24, with contributions of 0.32 percentage point and 1.63 percentage points, respectively. Spatially, weaker economic growth was suppressed by the Java and Sumatra regions. Economic growth on these two islands reached only +4.92% YoY and +4.48% YoY in 3Q24, much lower than Maluku and Papua (+6% YoY), Sulawesi (+5.87% YoY), Bali and Nusa Tenggara (+5.28% YoY), and Kalimantan (+5.2% YoY). The release of 3Q24 economic growth data came just a few days after BPS [announced] that Indonesian consumer price index inflation slowed to 1.71% in October 2024 (vs. September 2024: 1.84% YoY inflation), marking the lowest level since October 2021.",

      "content": "The weakening inflation trend and economic growth realization below expectations can be an indicator of weakening public purchasing power, leading to a downtrading phenomenon as we have written in Stockbit Snips. This phenomenon can be a positive catalyst for consumer issuers with product positioning in the 'value' segment, such as Tempo Scan Pacific (TSPC). We have also released the TSPC Unboxing which you can read here. Nevertheless, we see a shifting trend in growth drivers from Java and Sumatra to other islands. We also observe this trend in retail issuers - such as ACES (as we have written here) and MIDI - which are experiencing more significant growth outside of Java, along with the corporation's future strategy to be more expansive outside Java.",
