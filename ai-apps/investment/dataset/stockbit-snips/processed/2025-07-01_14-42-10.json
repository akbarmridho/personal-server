      "content": "BPS noted that Indonesia's inflation in June 2025 was 1.87% YoY (vs. May 2025: 1.6% YoY, June 2024: 2.51% YoY), higher than the consensus expectation of 1.83% YoY although in line with Bank Indonesia's target range of 1.5-3.5%.\nAnnually, inflation was driven by the group 'personal care and other services' which contributed 0.59 percentage point, with 0.48 percentage point coming from jewelry gold commodities. Meanwhile, the group 'food, beverages, and tobacco' contributed 0.58 percentage point to the annual inflation in June 2025.\nMonthly, Indonesia recorded 0.19% MoM inflation in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: deflation of 0.37% MoM, June 2024: deflation of 0.08% MoM). Meanwhile, core inflation slowed to 2.37% YoY in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 2.4% YoY inflation, June 2024: 1.9% YoY inflation), slightly lower than the consensus expectation which projected 2.44% YoY core inflation.\nBesides inflation, BPS also noted that Indonesia's trade balance surplus reached 4.3 billion US dollars in May 2025 (vs. April 2025: 158.8 million US dollars, May 2024: 2.9 billion US dollars), exceeding the consensus expectation which projected a surplus of 2.4 billion US dollars. This result was driven by export growth of +9.68% YoY in May 2025, far exceeding the consensus expectation of +1% YoY. Meanwhile, imports in May 2025 grew by +4.14% YoY, also higher than the consensus expectation of -0.1% YoY.\nCumulatively during 5M25, Indonesia's trade balance recorded a surplus of 15.38 billion US dollars. The increase in exports of +6.98% YoY during 5M25 was mainly driven by an increase from the group 'animal and vegetable fats/oils' (CPO) by +33.1% YoY. Meanwhile, imports increased more moderately by +5.45% YoY, which was primarily suppressed by crude oil imports (-11.75% YoY).",

      "content": "1. The government officially issued a number of regulations related to goods imports as part of policy deregulation to strengthen the national economy. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said on Monday (30/6) that there are policy changes regarding prohibitions and restrictions for 10 main commodities. Meanwhile, the Minister of Trade, Budi Santoso, stated that he has signed 9 regulations related to this, divided into several clusters according to their respective objectives, namely Ministerial Regulation of Trade numbers 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 of 2025.\n2. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated that the 2025 State Budget deficit is projected to reach 2.78% of GDP. This projection is higher compared to the 2025 State Budget target of 2.53% of GDP and has the potential to be the largest deficit in the last 2 decades (excluding the pandemic), although it remains below the 3% limit mandated by regulation. During 1H25 alone, the 2025 State Budget deficit reached 0.81% of GDP (vs. 1H24: 0.34% of GDP). This latest projection comes only a few days after Sri Mulyani last week said that the government is committed to fiscal discipline and estimates the 2025 State Budget deficit will reach 2.5% of GDP.\n3. Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara is seeking a multi-currency loan of up to 10 billion US dollars for general corporate purposes, which could become the largest credit facility in Southeast Asia. Bloomberg sources mentioned that Danantara has sent proposals to regional and international banks for a loan with a tenor of around 3-5 years. Danantara has not commented on this news from Bloomberg. In separate news, Kontan reported that Danantara is projected to receive funding of 10 billion US dollars from foreign banks in July 2025.\n4. The Director General of Land Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation, Aan Suhanan, stated that they will raise two-wheeled online motorcycle taxi (ojol) fares by about +8-15% per kilometer, depending on zoning. Aan mentioned that this increase still requires approval from the application parties. The discourse on raising ojol fares is the government's response to driver complaints regarding disproportionate income relative to operational costs.\n5. Bloomberg reported that China will extend anti-dumping duties on stainless steel product imports for the next 5 years, including from Indonesia. This policy, which has been in effect since July 2019, is intended to protect China's industry from oversupply and global trade uncertainty. The duty tariff for stainless steel products from Indonesia remains at 20.2%, the European Union and the UK at 43%, and for most South Korean companies reaches 103.1%.\n6. S&P Global noted that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.9 in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 47.4), marking a contraction in factory activity for the 3rd consecutive month. This result was pressured by new orders which fell for the 3rd straight month at the sharpest rate since August 2021. Meanwhile, S&P Global noted that China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 48.3), exceeding the consensus expectation of 49. This increase was supported by output growing at the fastest pace since November 2024 along with rising new orders amid improving trade conditions and promotional activities.\n7. BPS noted that foreign tourist (wisman) visits to Indonesia reached ~1.3 million people in May 2025 (+14% YoY, +12% MoM). This result brought the cumulative wisman visits to ~5.6 million people during 5M25 (+7.4% YoY), equivalent to 35-40% of the government's 2025 target in the range of 14-16 million people.",

This target takes into account Indonesia's weaker macroeconomic conditions compared to the previous year. MAPI itself plans to budget capital expenditure worth 2 trillion rupiah during 2025 for expansion, including for the expansion of 40 new Starbucks outlets through MAP Boga Adiperkasa (MAPB). Since early 2025, MAPB has closed 16 Starbucks outlets and opened 11 new ones.",
