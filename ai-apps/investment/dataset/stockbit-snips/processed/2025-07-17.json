      "title": "RI-EU Trade Agreement Near Completion",
      "content": "Indonesia and the European Union announced last weekend that both parties have reached a political agreement on a free trade agreement called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani said on Monday (14 July) that the agreement, which has been negotiated for ten years, will be signed in September 2025.\n\nSo far, the details of the CEPA have not been disclosed. However, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said in June 2025 that the agreement will give Indonesia zero tariffs for almost 80% of its export products to the EU together with the removal of other non-tariff barriers.\n\nAirlangga added that the deal will give Indonesian export commodities to the EU a level playing field comparable to other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam, which have historically enjoyed lower EU tariffs. He explained that Indonesian exports have been subject to tariffs of about 10-20% by the EU. According to various media, the commodities that face EU tariffs include palm-oil derivatives with rates of about 5-12.8%, biodiesel (palm-oil based) around 8-18%, textiles about 8-12%, and seafood around 16-20%.\n\nDirector General at the Ministry of Trade Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono said in June 2025 that the EU has committed to providing market access for priority Indonesian products such as palm oil, textiles, footwear, and seafood. In return, Indonesia has pledged to improve market access for EU agricultural and manufacturing products. Based on Djatmiko’s presentation slides, the main benefits for Indonesia include increased foreign direct investment from the EU in sectors such as renewable energy, semiconductors, and mineral derivatives.\n\nIn June 2025, Reuters reported that the CEPA would increase Indonesia’s exports to the EU by 5.4% according to an internal government benefit analysis, but senior Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto said this was a conservative estimate and he targets a 50% increase in export volumes within three to four years after the agreement is implemented.\n\nThe EU is Indonesia’s fifth-largest trading partner, with total bilateral trade reaching €27.3 billion in 2024. Of that, Indonesia exported commodities worth €17.5 billion to the EU in 2024, while the EU exported commodities worth €9.7 billion to Indonesia.\n\nThe free trade agreement comes after the EU classified Indonesia as a ‘standard-risk’ country under its anti-deforestation law, meaning Indonesian exporters will be exempt from the strictest compliance checks for goods exported to Europe as of 30 December 2025. The agreement also appears amid trade tensions between the EU and the United States, where the EU is considering imposing tariffs on US products following President Donald Trump’s threat to levy a 30% tariff on most EU imports starting 1 August 2025.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "Overall, we assess that tariff and/or trade policies from President Donald Trump could increase the urgency for Indonesia and the EU to finalize this agreement as an alternative market for both parties.\n\nSectorally, we see that the significance of this trade deal for Indonesia lies in the textile and textile product (TPT) sector. According to estimates from the Indonesian Textile Association, TPT exports to Europe could grow up to 2-3 times within the next five years after the agreement is reached. This increase corresponds to about 15-30% of Indonesia’s total annual TPT exports, potentially revitalizing a sector that employs many workers in Indonesia. In contrast, for palm-oil and seafood products, the contribution of increased demand to total exports is relatively limited, given that the EU is not a primary market for these Indonesian exports.",

Trump added that although the likelihood of removing Powell is very small, Powell could step down if he becomes involved in a fraud case. The statement indicates that the potential dismissal of Powell remains possible if strong reasons arise. Trump and his allies have recently criticized Powell over the cost of renovating the Federal Reserve’s headquarters in Washington, as well as the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Bloomberg reported that Trump’s remarks came after a White House official and several U.S. Congress members met with Trump on Tuesday (15 July) and said they expected Trump would take action against Powell.",

She added that she expects the impact of this access on Indonesia’s overall imports to be moderate. Pangestu said that a tariff agreement with the U.S. would benefit Indonesia as lower tariffs would apply to major Indonesian exports to the U.S., such as palm oil.",
