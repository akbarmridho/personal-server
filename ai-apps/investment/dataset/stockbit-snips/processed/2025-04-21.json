      "title": "TLKM 2024: Net Profit -4% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Telkom Indonesia (TLKM) recorded net profit of IDR 5.9 trillion in 4Q24 (+18% YoY, +1% QoQ). This result makes the net profit for 2024 total IDR 23.6 trillion (-4% YoY), in line with expectations (99% of the 2024F consensus estimate). \n\n1. Stable subscriber base, quarterly ARPU increase\nOperationally, TLKM reported 159.4 million mobile subscribers in 4Q24 (+0% YoY, +1% QoQ), with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of IDR 44,000 (-5% YoY, +2% QoQ). Although down year-on-year, this marks the first quarterly increase in mobile ARPU since its peak at IDR 49.7 thousand in 2Q23. The quarterly ARPU rise is a positive signal for telecom operators amid intense price-war dynamics in 2024. \n\nOn the broadband side, subscriber count rose in 4Q24 (+8% YoY, +1% QoQ), while ARPU fell to IDR 233,000 (-6% YoY, -1% QoQ). The broadband ARPU decline is likely due to fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) strategies and/or tight price competition in the fixed-broadband segment. \n\n2. Operating profit fell quarterly due to higher marketing costs\nDespite operational metrics improving quarter-over-quarter, TLKM’s operating profit in 4Q24 fell to IDR 10 trillion (+1% YoY, -6% QoQ), mainly because marketing expenses rose to IDR 1.3 trillion (+38% YoY, +36% QoQ) driven by a customer loyalty program. This brings 2024 operating profit to IDR 42.4 trillion (-6% YoY), slightly below expectations (97% of the 2024F consensus). Marketing expense ratio stayed at 2.6% of total revenue, consistent with the historical 2-3% range. \n\nTLKM also recorded a fair-value gain on investments of IDR 664 billion in 4Q24 (vs. 3Q24 gain of IDR 381 billion; 4Q23 loss of IDR 566 billion), bringing total 2024 gain from this item to IDR 188 billion (vs. 2023 loss of IDR 748 billion). \n\n3. Potential dividend yield 6.5-7.4%\nAssuming a dividend payout ratio of 70-80% – based on projections from various media – TLKM could distribute a 2024 dividend of IDR 167-191 per share, equivalent to a dividend yield of about 6.5-7.4% based on the Monday (21/4) closing price of IDR 2,570 per share. TLKM plans to hold its AGM on 27 May 2025 to set the 2024 dividend. \n\nKey Takeaway\nIn the earnings call on Monday (21/4), TLKM management targeted low-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 (vs. 2024 actual +0.5% YoY), an EBITDA margin of about 50-52% (vs. 2024 actual 50%) and capex-to-sales of 17-19% (vs. 2024 actual 16.3%). For comparison, Indosat (ISAT) targets stronger revenue growth than the market in 2025 (vs. 2024 +9% YoY), higher EBITDA margin (vs. 2024 47%) and capex of IDR 13 trillion (vs. 2024 IDR 9.9 trillion). We assess TLKM’s 2025 targets as relatively realistic given industry trends and consumer purchasing power. Both TLKM and ISAT targets align with consensus forecasts (2025F TLKM: +3.8% YoY, 2025F ISAT: +5% YoY) and higher EBITDA margins (2025F TLKM: 52%, 2025F ISAT: 48%). \n\nUsing the guidance from TLKM and ISAT, we judge that telecom operators will likely adopt a wait-and-see stance in 2025 and await the impact of the EXCL-FREN merger before pursuing more aggressive growth. Nonetheless, we see TLKM’s quarterly ARPU growth and current operator consolidation as signs that the sector is moving toward a more positive outlook (the worst is over).",
