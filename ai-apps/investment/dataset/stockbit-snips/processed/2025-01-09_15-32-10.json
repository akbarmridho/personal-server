      "title": "Qatari Investor Enters 1 Million Home Program",
      "content": "The Indonesian Government signed a memorandum of understanding with an investor from Qatar, Qilaa International Group, on Wednesday (8/1) to build 1 million affordable homes for low-income urban communities, which is part of the government's plan to build 3 million homes per year under President Prabowo Subianto's administration. In this cooperation, the government will provide land to build apartments, prioritizing the areas of Jakarta, Banten, and West Java. Meanwhile, Qilaa International Group will act as the contractor and finance the project. However, details regarding the value and duration of this cooperation are not yet known. Besides Qatar, the Head of the Housing Task Force and President Prabowo Subianto's younger brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, stated in December 2024 that the United Arab Emirates would also cooperate to build 1 million affordable homes. This announcement came just a day after the Minister of Housing and Settlement Areas, Maruarar Sirait, stated that he was discussing with the President and the Public Housing Savings Management Agency (BP Tapera) to change the Tapera contribution from mandatory to voluntary. Based on existing regulations, the Tapera contribution will be mandatory for all workers earning above the minimum wage starting May 20, 2027, with a rate of 3% of monthly income. However, it is still unknown whether Maruarar's statement implies that the government will revise the Tapera regulation moving forward. Maruarar mentioned that the government is still awaiting the Constitutional Court's decision on the public lawsuit against the existing Tapera regulation.",
