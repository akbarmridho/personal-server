      "title": "BI Rate Drops -25 Bps, Beyond Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia lowered the BI Rate by -25 bps to the level of 5.75% today, Wednesday (15/1), with the deposit facility and lending facility also decreasing by -25 bps to 5% and 6.5% respectively. This decision was outside the consensus expectations which anticipated the BI Rate would be maintained at 6%. Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, stated that the decision was made by considering the balance between the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate and Indonesia's economic growth. Bank Indonesia itself cut Indonesia's economic growth outlook for 2025 from the range of +4.8-5.6% YoY to +4.7-5.5% YoY following weakening consumption, employment, investment, and exports. For 4Q24 specifically, Bank Indonesia projects Indonesian economic growth to only be around +5-5.1% YoY. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia expects inflation in 2025 and 2026 to remain low according to the previous target in the range of 1.5-3.5% YoY (vs. 2024 inflation: 1.57% YoY). The BI Rate cut occurred amidst the weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar in recent months, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, the direction of the new US government policy, and the strengthening of the higher-for-longer narrative regarding US interest rates. Bank Indonesia also lowered the expectation for Fed rate cuts during 2025 from -50 bps in November 2024 to only -25 bps following the potential hindrance of disinflation progress due to import duty hikes initiated by the US President-elect, Donald Trump. Bank Indonesia's expectation is in line with market expectations based on the CME Fedwatch Tool analysis as of Wednesday (15/1). Perry mentioned that clarity on policy direction from Trump and the Fed would help ease global volatility. To maintain the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate, Bank Indonesia will continue to intervene in the bond market, spot market, and domestic non-deliverable forward market, as well as optimize the Bank Indonesia Rupiah Securities (SRBI), Bank Indonesia Foreign Exchange Sukuk (SUVBI), and Bank Indonesia Foreign Exchange Securities (SVBI). Perry mentioned that Bank Indonesia is preparing SUVBI and SVBI as additional incentive instruments for the placement of foreign exchange from natural resource exports (DHE SDA), besides existing instruments such as FX term deposits and FX swaps. Previously, the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that the government would revise the minimum tenor for DHE SDA placement from 3 months to 1 year, a step aimed at increasing the supply of domestic foreign exchange to alleviate pressure on the Rupiah. Following the announcement of the BI Rate cut, the IHSG strengthened by +1.77% at the market close today, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened by -0.3% to the level of 16,320, and the 10-year government bond yield decreased by -0.4 bps to the level of 7.272%.",
