      "title": "Indonesia Coal Exports to China Down 12% YoY in 1H25",
      "content": "China customs recorded that Indonesia's coal imports in June 2025 fell 30% year-on-year to about 11.6 million tonnes. This result means China imported roughly 91 million tonnes of Indonesian coal during the first half of 2025, down 12% YoY. For context, Indonesian coal exports to China grew modestly in 1Q25 (+1% YoY) before starting an annual decline in 4M25 (-5% YoY). The decline in Chinese imports of Indonesian coal in 1H25 is deeper than imports from other countries, such as Russia (-4% YoY), Mongolia (-4% YoY), and Australia (-1% YoY). Overall, Chinese coal imports in June 2025 dropped to about 33 million tonnes (-26% YoY, -8% MoM), marking the lowest monthly import level since February 2023. This brings total Chinese coal imports in 1H25 down 11% YoY to approximately 221.7 million tonnes. Reuters reported that the downward trend in Indonesian coal imports to China occurs alongside rising domestic coal production in China. In addition, lower global coal prices have made high-calorific-value coal, which yields more energy per tonne, more cost-competitive, thereby pressuring demand for Indonesia's lower-calorific-value coal. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) noted that Indonesia's coal production since the start of 2025 reached about 390.2 million tonnes as of 22 July 2025, roughly 53% of the 2025 target. Meanwhile, Indonesian coal exports amounted to about 199.2 million tonnes, only about 40% of the 2025 target.",

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday (21 July) that a 19% tariff on Indonesian export goods to the United States could be implemented earlier than the August 1, 2025 deadline set by President Donald Trump.
