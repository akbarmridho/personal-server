      "title": "The Fed Maintains Interest Rate, Strengthening the Higher for Longer Signal",
      "content": "The US central bank, The Fed, decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate in the range of 5.25-5.5% in its meeting on Wednesday (1/5) local time, in line with consensus expectations. During the meeting, The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, hinted that they would not raise interest rates further. However, he also stated that inflation data being higher than expected for three consecutive months in the first quarter of 2024 could cause interest rate cuts to be slower than initially anticipated. On Thursday (2/5), probability analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool showed that the market expects The Fed rate cuts to begin in September 2024, with a probability reaching 56.4%. This probability decreased compared to 58% on April 25, 2024. The narrative of persistently high US interest rates for a longer period (higher for longer) triggered selling pressure from foreign investors (outflow) in the Indonesian stock and bond markets. In the last month, the IHSG experienced a foreign outflow of IDR 20.31 trillion as of April 30, 2024. Meanwhile, as of April 29, 2024, the Indonesian bond market recorded a foreign outflow of IDR 16.73 trillion in the last month. Apart from interest rates, The Fed also announced that they will reduce the pace of balance sheet reduction starting June 1, 2024, to 25 billion US dollars per month, lower than the previous 60 billion US dollars. Meanwhile, mortgage-backed securities are still allowed to be issued with a limit of 35 billion US dollars per month. This step is aimed at ensuring the financial system does not run out of reserves, similar to what happened in 2019 during The Fed's last round of quantitative tightening.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "The Fed's signal to delay US interest rate cuts could potentially cause Bank Indonesia's interest rate expectations to remain higher for longer. Previously, in the Board of Governors Meeting in April 2024, Bank Indonesia decided to raise the BI Rate again by 25 bps to the level of 6.25% to curb the weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar. Responding to the strengthening of the higher for longer signal, the yield on the 10-year Indonesian government bond rose again by 10 bps to the level of 7.278% in trading today, Thursday (2/5). In the last 1 month, the yield has increased by 63 bps. The persistence of high interest rates for a longer period potentially suppresses the performance of several sectors, including: Property and automotive - Weakening demand due to high interest rates for Housing Ownership Loans (KPR) and Motor Vehicle Loans (KKB). Construction - High debt levels increase the interest burden that must be paid. Banking - High Cost of Fund amidst slowing CGS growth. In this case, the majority of banks have reported an increase in Cost of Fund in 1Q24, squeezing their profitability (NIM), in line with industrial data from OJK.",
