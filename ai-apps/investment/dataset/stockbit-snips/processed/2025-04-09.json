      "title": "RI Proposal for Negotiations on U.S. Tariffs",
      "content": "Indonesia’s government on Tuesday (8 April) announced its response to the reciprocal tariff imposed by the United States. In principle, President Prabowo Subianto said Indonesia will pursue negotiations with the United States, including revitalising the trade and investment agreement that has not been updated since 1996. The government is formulating several policy measures to be offered as a negotiation package with the United States, including:\n\n- **Deregulation of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs)** – Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the NTM option was chosen after reflecting on the United States’ rejection of Vietnam’s proposal to offer a 0% U.S. import tariff. The U.S. rejection was because the United States also considers non-tariff barriers in its reciprocal-tariff negotiations. The NTMs proposed by the Indonesian government include: 1) relaxation of the domestic content (TKDN) component level in the technology, information and communications (ICT) sector from the United States; 2) evaluation of import procedures, such as simplification/removal of import quotas/technical licences; and 3) acceleration of halal certification. Currently, Indonesia applies a minimum 25% TKDN requirement, with several ICT products required to have a minimum 35% TKDN.\n- **Increase of Imports from the United States** – The increase aims to balance Indonesia’s trade balance with the United States. Indonesia recorded a US trade surplus of USD 19.3 billion in 2024, the fourth-largest in Southeast Asia. Going forward, the government plans to increase imports from the United States, covering agricultural products such as soybeans and wheat, engineering equipment, and oil-and-gas products such as LPG. Currently, the United States supplies 89% of Indonesia’s soybean imports, 5% of wheat, 5% of engineering equipment, and 53% of LPG.\n- **Fiscal Incentives** – A number of incentives are being prepared to facilitate business, including for U.S. investors. The fiscal incentives include acceleration and simplification of various tax processes (such as audits and restitutions) and adjustments to various rates (import corporate income tax, import duties on U.S. products, and export duties on palm oil).\n\nCo-ordinator of Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said the government has sent a letter to the United States government regarding this negotiation package.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "In general, the relaxation of business rules through deregulation of TKDN requirements and/or easing of import provisions could increase competition for domestic manufacturers, although it may benefit consumers. At the same time, adjustments to various tariffs and duties could reduce potential state revenue. These risks could be offset if Indonesia secures a negotiation agreement that smooths the path for expanding export market share to the United States (trade diversion). Investors should watch the dynamic negotiations, avoid panic selling, and stay invested if the fundamentals of their holdings are sound. History shows markets can recover from crises such as 2008 and 2020. A diversified portfolio across asset classes can help mitigate volatility; short-term government bonds (e.g., PBS003, ST014-T2) or money-market funds are also options.",
