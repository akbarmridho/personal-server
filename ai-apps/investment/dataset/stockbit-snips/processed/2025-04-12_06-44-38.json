      "content": "From the two corporate actions above, PT Integrasi Jaringan Ekosistem has the potential to receive funds of 9.9 trillion rupiah, so we estimate that the FTTH network construction planned by WIFI can be carried out organically or inorganically. Inorganic acquisition in the fiber optic industry in Indonesia is still possible. DealStreetAsia and Reuters reported in September 2024 that Link Net (LINK) and Indosat (ISAT) are exploring the sale of part or all of their shares in their fiber optic business, with transaction value ranges reported at around 400-500 million US dollars (6.6-8.3 trillion rupiah) and 1-2 billion US dollars (16.5-33 trillion rupiah) respectively. In general, we assess that WIFI's profitability has the potential to decrease along with this large expansion because the take-up rate will tend to be lower (vs. 2024 take-up rate: over 90%). Nevertheless, the potential decrease in profitability can be compensated by the potential for greater business growth, so the overall impact on WIFI's net profit is still positive. If WIFI decides to expand inorganically, investors also need to pay attention to the valuation of the acquisition transaction.",

This announcement from the Chinese government came only one day after the US government stated on April 10, 2025, that total import tariffs originating from China reached 145%. US President Donald Trump, in a cabinet meeting on Thursday (10/4), said that he would love to make a trade deal with China to end the trade war. US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, on the same occasion said that certainty regarding tariff policy will emerge after the US reaches an agreement with other countries.",
