      "content": "Bloomberg reported that PT Super Bank Indonesia (Superbank) has begun measuring investor interest for an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), with the company planning investor education meetings from 6-17 October 2025. Seventy percent of the IPO proceeds will be used by Superbank as working capital for credit disbursement, while the remainder will fund capital expenditures including the development of systems and information technology products.\n\nBloomberg noted that CLSA Sekuritas will act as joint global coordinator, while CNBC Indonesia reported that CLSA Sekuritas and Mandiri Sekuritas will serve as underwriters for the IPO.\n\nThe Superbank IPO plan first appeared in a Bloomberg report in January 2025, which mentioned that the company targeted IPO proceeds of USD 200-300 million with a valuation of USD 1.5-2 billion, implying an offering of 10-20% of total shares. Bloomberg at that time said the IPO plan was still under consideration and the target proceeds and valuation could change at any time.\n\nAccording to the company’s website, current shareholders include Elang Mahkota Teknologi (EMTK) via PT Elang Media Visitama (31.11%), Grab via PT Kudo Teknologi Indonesia (19.16%), A5-DB Holdings (11.52%) and GXS Bank (12%), KakaoBank (9.95%), Singtel Alpha Investments (8.46%).\n\nIn 1H25, Superbank recorded a net profit of IDR 20.1 billion (vs. a loss of IDR 188 billion in 1H24), supported by a rise in Net Interest Income to IDR 667.6 billion (+171% YoY) as Net Interest Margin increased to 10.2% (vs. 8.1% in 1H24).",
