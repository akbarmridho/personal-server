      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) recorded a net profit of 5 trillion rupiah in 3Q25 (-11% YoY, +7% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 9M25 to reach 15.1 trillion rupiah (-7% YoY), equivalent to 73% of the consensus 2025F estimate. Although the 9M25 realization is below the historical seasonal trend (vs. 9M24: 76% of 2024 realization, 9M23: 75% of 2023 realization), the net profit in 3Q25 was burdened by management's decision to bring forward some opex and provision expenses that were due to be booked in 4Q25 to 3Q25. Therefore, we assess the 9M25 net profit realization as performance that is still in line with expectations. Non-Interest Income was the highlight in 3Q25 with a growth of +12% YoY and +23% QoQ, driven by gains from government bonds and solid transaction banking activities in general.",

      "title": "Maintaining Credit Growth and CoC Guidance, Revising Down 2025 NIM Guidance",
      "content": "Despite receiving liquidity injection from the government, BBNI management stated in the 3Q25 earnings call that they are still maintaining the 2025 credit growth guidance in the range of +8-10% YoY, with realization as of September 2025 standing at +10% YoY (vs. June 2025: +7% YoY). BBNI has disbursed approximately 50% of the government's liquidity injection funds as of September 2025, as we previously summarized. Segmentally, BBNI revealed that credit demand from the corporate segment remains high, while no strengthening in consumer segment demand has been observed. Regarding the 2026 guidance, BBNI management is still in discussions but estimates that credit growth potential will be slightly higher than in 2025. From the margin aspect, management foresees that loan yield may tend to decline starting in 4Q25 and into 2026F along with the trend of declining interest rates and looser liquidity. The guidance for 2025 Net Interest Margin (NIM) was revised down from ≥3.8% to ~3.7%, indicating that loan yield pressure potentially outweighs the impact of the decline in Cost of Fund (CoF). In September 2025, MTD CoF decreased to 2.8% from 3.1% in August 2025, driven by increased liquidity which started to reduce the special rate. Asset quality relatively improved, with Special Mention Loans (SML) and Loan-at-Risk (LAR) declining quarter-on-quarter, while Non-Performing Loans (NPL) were relatively stable quarter-on-quarter in 3Q25.",

The 9M25 net profit performance was supported by an increase in PPOP (+84% YoY), following the adjustment in the effective interest income calculation for the non-subsidized mortgage segment.

Meanwhile, CoC in 2026 is also expected to drop to the range of 1-1.1%, while increasing the NPL Coverage Ratio to the range of 120-130%, indicating potential asset quality improvement.",
