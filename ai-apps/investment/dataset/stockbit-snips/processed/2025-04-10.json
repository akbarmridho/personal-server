      "title": "Trump Pauses Tariffs for 56 Countries, Tariff for China Increases to 125%",
      "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday (April 9 local time) a temporary suspension of the implementation of higher reciprocal tariffs for 56 countries for a period of 90 days. However, the tariff for China remains in effect and is increased from 104% to 125% in response to Chinese retaliatory actions. In addition, Trump continues the basic reciprocal tariff of 10% for all imports into the United States. The tariff postponement comes amid financial market panic and growing pressure from business owners and investors to cancel the policy. Previously, on Tuesday (April 8) Trump hinted that the United States was open to reaching an agreement that could reduce or eliminate the higher reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday (April 9) Trump added that countries that do not take retaliatory steps will be given a reward. The decision to keep the higher reciprocal tariff for China occurs amid an escalating trade war between the two nations. Earlier, the Chinese government on Wednesday (April 9) announced an increase in tariffs on U.S. imports from 34% to 84% effective April 10, 2025, and stated it would take the United States to the World Trade Organization (WTO). This follows a U.S. tariff increase imposed on China after China took retaliatory steps. On Thursday (April 10), a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Jian, said that the U.S. decision to start a trade war with China will end in failure, but added that the Chinese government hopes the United States can resolve differences with China through dialogue. To date, China has not announced any retaliatory tariff increase after the United States applied a 125% tariff. Domestically, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said on Thursday (April 10) that the 32% tariff imposed by the United States on Indonesia could cut Indonesia's potential economic growth by about 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points. She welcomed the 90-day tariff suspension, describing the period as an opportunity to negotiate, reduce economic risk, and build mutually beneficial cooperation. In response to Trump’s announcement, U.S. equity markets rebounded sharply on Wednesday (April 9) with the S&P 500 up 9.52% and the Nasdaq up 12.16%. The positive sentiment spread to Asian markets on Thursday (April 10), with the Nikkei up 8.99%, the Shanghai Stock Exchange up 1.16%, and the Hong Kong Index up 2.06%. The Indonesian Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 4.79% on Thursday (April 10), the Indonesian rupiah strengthened by 0.38% to 16,800 per U.S. dollar, and the yield on the 10-year Indonesian government bond fell about 9 basis points to 7.048%. Key Takeaway: Although the 90-day pause provides time for negotiations, we assess that the outcome of negotiations and the shift in stance by both the United States and China remain highly dynamic. Japan and South Korea are reported to have been negotiating with the United States, which may serve as a reference for other countries, so developments should be closely monitored by investors. Investors should remain vigilant and respond wisely to both positive and negative news related to the trade war, given the high uncertainty. Maintaining a diversified portfolio across asset classes can help minimize market volatility impact. Investors may consider short-term government bonds with lower volatility, such as PBS003 and ST014-T2, or money-market mutual funds.",
