      "content": "Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) announced an additional gas supply of more than 71.83 billion standard cubic meters (BBtud) that was signed at the IPA Convention & Exhibition on Wednesday, 21 May. The additional gas supply comes from several blocks, detailed as follows: For the domestic gas-swap agreement, the contract stipulates that a volume of pipeline gas from the Corridor Block and Jabung Block, previously sold to Singapore, will be replaced by gas from the Natuna blocks (South Natuna Sea Block B, Natuna Sea Block A, and PSC Kakap). The volume previously sold to Singapore will be re-allocated to meet domestic gas demand, with PGAS acting as the domestic buyer. The added gas supply, sourced from various oil-and-gas blocks in both pipeline and LNG form, provides supply certainty for Sumatra and western Java. Previously, PGAS President Director Arief S. Handoko warned that a gas deficit in western Java to northern Sumatra would occur in 2025-2035, driven by natural declining of existing suppliers that cannot be offset by new reserve discoveries or production from new gas fields. It is still unknown whether the additional supply will be allocated to the gas-price incentive (HGBT) or non-HGBT. Previously, the government set the HGBT gas price at USD 6.5-7 per MMBtu from January 2025 for five years, and any purchase exceeding the quota will be charged a regasification tariff of USD 16.77 per MMBtu. The Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Association, Edy Suyanto, said that the fulfillment of the HGBT volume quota has been falling, with the western Java quota dropping to 65.3% in April 2025 (versus 77% in March 2025) and eastern Java falling to 48.8% (versus 61% in March 2025).",
