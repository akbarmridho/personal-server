      "title": "Bank Indonesia Holds Interest Rate as Expected",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (19 March) decided to keep the benchmark BI Rate at 5.75%, in line with consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said that although there is room for a rate cut, the current global conditions do not allow it yet. He added that BI will monitor exchange rate movements, inflation, and economic growth before taking further action. The decision came one day after the IDX fell on Tuesday (18 March), which was partly driven by market concerns over Indonesia's economic outlook. Responding to those concerns, Perry said the market reaction was \"more driven by technical factors\" such as global tariff worries, and that Indonesian assets remain fundamentally attractive. Perry noted that BI maintains the same growth and inflation outlook presented at the Governors' Board meeting in January 2025. As context, BI had lowered the 2025 growth outlook from a range of +4.8-5.6% YoY to +4.7-5.5% YoY in that meeting. Following the rate decision, the rupiah weakened 0.6% to 16,525 per US dollar on Wednesday, while the IDX closed up 1.42% and the 10-year government bond yield rose 6 basis points to 7.09%. The rupiah has depreciated 1.2% month-on-month against the dollar. Going forward, BI expects the rupiah to strengthen on fundamentals, based on an attractive yield differential for investors. BI will continue foreign-exchange market interventions to keep the rate aligned with economic fundamentals. BI still expects the US Federal Reserve to cut rates by 25 basis points in 2025, driven by tariff-related recession concerns in the United States, but Perry cautioned that the Fed will not rush to cut given current uncertainties and a slowing disinflation process in the US.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "Although the decision to keep the BI Rate matched the consensus of economists, Bloomberg noted that 8 of 25 economists expect BI to cut rates today, partly to boost the economy. Recent concerns include a 0.09% YoY deflation in February 2025 and the earlier reduction of the growth outlook by BI. Eighteen of 32 economists anticipate a further 50-basis-point cut in 2025, while 11 of 32 expect only a 25-basis-point cut by year-end. Investors should watch: the US Fed rate decision on Wednesday (19 March), where the CME FedWatch Tool shows a 99% probability that the Fed will keep rates unchanged; and the Indonesian government's execution of programs to stimulate growth and improve investor confidence.",
