      "title": "Property Marketing Sales Compilation 1H25",
      "content": "Several residential property issuers have announced their marketing sales realization for 1H25, including Ciputra Development ($CTRA), Summarecon Agung ($SMRA), and Pakuwon Jati ($PWON) [see table]. CTRA recorded the highest realization against its marketing sales target (52%). CTRA's relatively good 1H25 achievement was supported by the launch of new clusters, which contributed ~54% to the total 2Q25 marketing sales. Meanwhile, SMRA recorded high 1H25 marketing sales growth (+42% YoY), resulting in a relatively better realization against the target (43%) compared to last year (1H24: 34% against target). The 1H25 marketing sales achievement itself was driven by the 100% government-borne value-added tax (PPN DTP) incentive. Throughout 1H25, PWON became the issuer with the highest contribution of PPN DTP to marketing sales, where 75% of the company's total marketing sales realization came from products eligible for this incentive. Meanwhile, SMRA has not released data regarding the contribution of PPN DTP. However, in 1H24, the contribution of products eligible for this incentive reached 61% of SMRA's marketing sales. The 100% PPN DTP incentive itself ends as of June 2025. During the July-December 2025 period, the incentive will be reduced to 50%. Key Takeaway: Generally, marketing sales realization in 2H25 has the potential to be more challenging in line with the decline in the incentive amount, thus requiring other positive catalysts to support sales. On the other hand, investors need to monitor Bank Indonesia's interest rate decision on Wednesday (16/7). As many as 18 out of 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the interest rate will be cut, with the rest predicting BI will maintain the rate. Although we assess the positive impact of an interest rate cut on sales as relatively limited, an interest rate cut still has the potential to provide positive sentiment for property stocks.",

      "content": "1. China's national statistics bureau recorded that China's economy in 2Q25 grew +5.2% YoY (vs. 1Q25: +5.4% YoY), above consensus expectations which predicted growth of +5.1% YoY. This economic growth was driven by strong exports to non-US markets, while domestic consumer demand remains weak. 2. President Director of BPJS Kesehatan, Ghufron Mukti, said that the Coordination of Benefits (CoB) scheme can already be used by BPJS Kesehatan participants. Ghufron added that this scheme applies to BPJS Kesehatan class 1 and class 2 participants. For information, CoB is a scheme to maximize health guarantee benefits for participants who have both BPJS and supplementary health insurance. 3. Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said that Indonesia will only realize the plan to purchase oil-related products from the US worth 10-15 billion US dollars if the US lowers tariffs for Indonesia. Previously, it was reported that Indonesia had offered up to 15.5 billion US dollars for the purchase of energy products from the US in an effort to reduce the trade surplus and obtain lower tariffs. 4. Perum Bulog stated it will involve village/sub-district cooperatives (kopdes/kel) Merah Putih as partners for distributing rice for food supply and price stabilization (SPHP). President Director of Perum Bulog, Ahmad Rizal Ramdhani, said that Merah Putih kopdes/kel can apply for the required amount of rice at the local Bulog office.
