      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate Amid Rupiah Weakening",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (18/12) decided to keep the BI Rate at 6% while the deposit facility and lending facility were maintained at 5.25% and 6.75% respectively. The decision matched consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the move was taken amid high global economic uncertainty, especially regarding U.S. policy direction and escalating geopolitical tensions in various regions. Perry noted that this uncertainty has driven a stronger U.S. dollar, with the DXY index up +1.2% month-to-date to 107 on Wednesday (18/12) as capital flows shifted to the United States.\n\nThe BI Rate hold is also linked to a narrowing of U.S. rate-cut space after former President Trump’s victory. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a U.S. rate cut of ≥75 bps by June 2025 fell from 62.7% (5/11) before Trump’s win to 37.1% on Wednesday (18/12).\n\nThe macro backdrop pushed the rupiah down –1.5% month-to-date to IDR 16,090 per dollar. Nevertheless, Perry believes the rupiah remains relatively contained and expects it to stay stable given BI’s commitment to stability, attractive government bond yields, low inflation and solid growth prospects.\n\nKey Takeaway: A more hawkish rate sentiment has spurred capital outflows from the IDX, with net foreign outflows of IDR 10.1 trillion over the past month to 17 December 2024. Meanwhile, Indonesian government bond yields have generally risen. The situation can be used by investors to lock in higher yields, such as PBS032 (1.5-year maturity) offering 6.76% yield or FR0076 (23-year maturity) offering 7.12% yield.",
