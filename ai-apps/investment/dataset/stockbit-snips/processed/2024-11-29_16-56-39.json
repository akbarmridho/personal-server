      "title": "ADRO Announces Dividend Value & Prospectus Summary for AADI Share Purchase Rights (PUPS)",
      "content": "Alamtri Resources Indonesia (ADRO) on Friday (29/11) announced the dividend value per share and the prospectus regarding the public offering by shareholders (PUPS) of Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI). Here is the summary: ADRO Dividend of 1,358 Rupiah per Share. This amount indicates a yield of 37% based on the ADRO share price of 3,670 Rupiah per share on the cum date on November 26, 2024. This dividend value is not far different from our estimate at 1,359 Rupiah per share. According to our calculation, this dividend amount can cover the costs required to exercise the AADI PUPS, excluding the transaction fee of 0.18% charged by Trimegah Sekuritas as the underwriter. AADI PUPS Subscription Ratio 4.389:1. ADRO announced that every holder of 4,389 ADRO shares is entitled to subscribe to 1,000 AADI shares. This figure is not far different from our calculation which estimated that every owner of 100 ADRO shares is entitled to subscribe to ~23 AADI shares (ratio 4.4:1). If it falls on a decimal calculation, the right to purchase shares will be rounded down. For illustration, if an investor holds 4,000 ADRO shares (~40 lots), the proportional calculation for the right to subscribe to AADI shares is (4,000) / (4.389) x (1,000) = 911.3693324 shares. Since the calculation result is in decimals, the right to subscribe to AADI shares will be rounded down to 911 shares. Offering Price for AADI Shares Ranges from 5,546-5,960 Rupiah per Share. The offering price for AADI shares through PUPS will be the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) per AADI share formed after the first trading day of AADI shares on the IDX on December 5, 2024. Nevertheless, the lower limit for subscription will use the fair value of AADI shares at 5,546 Rupiah per share, while the maximum limit will be 107.5% of the fair value of AADI shares, or 5,960 Rupiah per share. This calculation is also not far different from our calculation which estimated the AADI PUPS offering price to range from 5,550-5,950 Rupiah per share. Transaction Fee of 0.18% for Exercising AADI PUPS Shares. Investors who exercise their rights in the AADI PUPS will be charged a 0.18% fee by Trimegah Sekuritas as the underwriter for this corporate action. Note for Stockbit Users. The estimated period to exercise the right to subscribe to AADI shares via PUPS is December 7-10, 2024, with the estimated distribution of AADI shares on December 10-11, 2024. The cut-off time for subscribing to AADI PUPS is 10:00 AM Western Indonesia Time (WIB) every trading day during the subscription period. Subscribing to AADI PUPS after the cut-off time (after 10:00 AM WIB) will be processed on the following business day during the subscription period. Key Takeaway: During today's trading, Friday (29/11), the ADRO share price was locked at the lower auto reject (ARB) level of 2,070 Rupiah per share, before closing weaker by -24.6% at 2,080 Rupiah per share. This indicates that the decline in ADRO share price since the cum date on November 26, 2024, has exceeded the amount of dividend to be received. Therefore, as we wrote in the previous Stockbit Commentary, investors will be more advantaged if they use the ADRO dividend to participate in the AADI PUPS, considering investors can gain upside from the potential increase in AADI share price. Investors who do not participate in the AADI PUPS will miss out on ADRO's thermal coal business at a valuation of 2.7x P/E 1H24 annualized, lower than ADRO's historical 5-year mean and its peers. Furthermore, the decline in ADRO's share price - at least until today - is not as deep as we predicted in our base case scenario, so investors have the potential to gain greater profits than in that scenario if AADI shares rise in line with our expectations. For Stockbit users who wish to participate in the AADI PUPS, the estimated exercise period via the Stockbit application is December 7-10, 2024, with AADI share distribution on December 10-11, 2024. We suggest exercising no later than December 9, 2024, at 10:00 AM WIB.",
