      "title": "Car Sales in October 2024 Highest During 2024",
      "content": "The Association of Indonesian Automotive Industries (Gaikindo) reported that national wholesale car sales in October 2024 amounted to 77,191 units, a decrease of 3.9 percent year‑on‑year but an increase of 6.2 percent month‑on‑month, marking the highest monthly sales since the beginning of 2024. Although still lower than the previous year, the year‑on‑year decline has narrowed. The result brings total wholesale car sales for the first ten months of 2024 (10M24) to 710,408 units, down 15 percent year‑on‑year, representing 83.6 percent of Gaikindo's 2024 target, which had been revised down to 850,000 units. Gaikindo Chairman Yohannes Nangoi said the association targets national wholesale car sales to recover to 1 million units in 2025, supported by lower interest rates and the growth of electric vehicle infrastructure outside Java and Bali. In October 2024, Astra International (ASII) recorded a sales decline of 1.9 percent year‑on‑year, but still performed better than the industry average of a 3.9 percent decline. This resulted in ASII's market share rising to 56.5 percent (October 2023: 55.3 percent). Based on brand, Daihatsu supported ASII's wholesale sales in October 2024 with stable sales of 14,096 units (0 percent year‑on‑year, +11.2 percent month‑on‑month), while Toyota+Lexus reached 27,211 units (‑1.6 percent year‑on‑year, +6.3 percent month‑on‑month). Cumulatively, ASII recorded wholesale sales of 401,398 units (‑13.8 percent year‑on‑year) during 10M24, relatively better than the industry decline. Among ASII's main competitors, Mitsubishi posted the relatively best performance with sales of 7,900 units (‑3.3 percent year‑on‑year, ‑3.2 percent month‑on‑month) in October 2024, bringing its 10M24 sales to 82,187 units (‑9.3 percent year‑on‑year). Honda recorded the most negative performance among ASII's peers in October 2024 and 10M24. BYD achieved sales of 2,488 units in October 2024 with a market share of 3.2 percent, surpassing Wuling (2.9 percent) and Hyundai (2.2 percent). Key Takeaway: We estimate that the improving wholesale sales figure, which exceeded 75,000 units in October 2024 – the highest monthly level in 2024 – may be driven by increased demand from corporate fleet segments following political certainty after the cabinet announcement. Automotive stocks have already reflected the improving sales trend. Therefore, regarding the outlook for automotive issuers, investors should monitor wholesale sales over the next two months to see whether the figure can stay in the 75,000‑80,000 range per month and continue to improve. This is needed to assess whether the annual recovery to 1 million units in 2025 remains realistic or will be revised downward.",
