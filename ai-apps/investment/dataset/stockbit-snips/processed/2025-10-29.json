      "title": "Danantara Prepares IDR 210 Trillion Credit Ceiling for Village Cooperatives (KDMP)",
      "content": "Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Farida Farichah said that Danantara has agreed to provide a credit ceiling of IDR 210 trillion for the development of approximately 80,000 Village Cooperatives (KDMP). Farida explained that Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), Bank Mandiri (BMRI), and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) will each manage IDR 66 trillion, while the remaining IDR 12 trillion will be placed at Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS). The table above shows the comparison of this ceiling with the current credit and third-party funds of the state-owned banks (Himbara). Danantara has not commented on Farida’s statement, so the source of the funds for the ceiling is not yet clear. Earlier, Minister of Cooperatives Ferry Juliantono in early October 2025 said that Danantara and the Ministry of Finance would channel additional funds to KDMP to accelerate physical construction and the operational needs of stores and warehouses. Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani said the Ministry of Finance support would be disbursed through the state budget, while the Director-General of the Ministry of Finance, Askolani, said the allocation could be taken from the inter-governmental transfer budget or other spending items. In the 2026 State Budget and Financial Statement, it is noted that the KDMP program will receive IDR 83 trillion from the state budget, to be channeled through Himbara.\n\nTo date, financing for KDMP that has been executed also involves Himbara, covering: 1) placement of the surplus budget (SAL) from the 2025 state budget amounting to IDR 16 trillion, with the related regulation enacted in early September 2025; and 2) a liquidity injection of IDR 200 trillion in early September 2025, which includes an interest-rate reduction incentive from about 3.8% to 2% if the funds are used for KDMP credit.\n\nThe latest development follows a delay in the programme’s implementation timeline. The latest update shows the government targets the physical infrastructure for about 80,000 KDMP to be completed and operational by March 2026, delayed from the original target of this month. As of Tuesday (28/10), only 22,351 KDMP are reported as active, representing 28% of the government target. Meanwhile, 82,246 KDMP have legal status, with 16,485 cooperatives already having stores.",
