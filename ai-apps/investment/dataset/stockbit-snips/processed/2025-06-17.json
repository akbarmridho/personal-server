      "content": "BPI Danantara and the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) said on Tuesday (17/6) that they have signed a memorandum of understanding worth USD 800 million with Chandra Asri Pacific ($TPIA). Under this MoU, Danantara and INA will explore the possibility of becoming new investors in a chlor-alkali and ethylene dichloride (CA-EDC) plant. The plant, to be operated by TPIA’s subsidiary PT Chandra Asri Alkali, is targeted to have an annual production capacity of 400,000 metric tons of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) and 500,000 metric tons of ethylene dichloride. TPIA director Edi Rivai said the company allocated capex of IDR 8.8 trillion for 2025, focused on building the CA-EDC plant. The project is already in the process design stage, and PT Chandra Asri Alkali has signed a three-year salt off-take agreement with BCI Minerals Limited for raw material supply. Previously, TPIA and INA signed an MoU in 2023 that allowed INA and potential foreign investors to explore purchasing shares of PT Chandra Asri Alkali. PT Chandra Asri Alkali also signed a letter of intent with PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) covering a potential wet caustic soda supply of up to 120,000 metric tons per year and a possible equity participation by Inalum of up to 10%. In a separate transaction, Aster Chemicals and Energy – a joint venture between TPIA and Glencore – announced it has signed an agreement to acquire the entire ownership of a condensate splitter facility and related assets from PCS Pte. Ltd. in Jurong Island, Singapore. The transaction value was not disclosed. Aster also plans to revitalize the facility, increasing its total oil processing capacity from 237,000 barrels per day to more than 300,000 barrels per day. Earlier, Aster announced a plan to acquire Chevron Phillips Singapore Chemicals, which currently operates a polyethylene plant with a capacity of 400,000 tons per year in Jurong Island.",
