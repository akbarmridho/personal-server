      "title": "Foreign Inflow Rp2 Trillion, IHSG Rebound +2.1%",
      "content": "Indonesia's composite index (IHSG) rose by 2.11% to 7,196.02 on Tuesday (3/11) as foreign inflow reached 2.08 trillion rupiah. This marks the first inflow—both in the regular market and overall—after a series of outflows since 6 November 2024, which had driven the index down 4.12% over the past month. The amount is the largest foreign inflow since 19 September 2024, when a similar 2.08 trillion rupiah was recorded. Today's inflow consisted of 797 billion rupiah in the regular market and 1.3 trillion rupiah in the cash and negotiation market. The ten stocks with the largest net foreign inflow in the regular market today are listed. Key Takeaway: Although it is still early to conclude that foreign investors have returned to Indonesia, the end of the daily outflow trend is a fresh breeze for investors. Sectorally, interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as banking (IDXFINANCE +1.55%), property (IDXPROPERTY +1.12%) and technology (IDXTECHNO +3.18%) posted significant gains today.",

The cum-date is 11 December 2024 on the regular and negotiation markets, with payment on 19 December 2024. Based on BFIN’s closing price on Tuesday (3/12), the implied dividend yield is approximately 3.1%.\n\nELSA reported that Elnusa plans to diversify its business in 2025 into chemical commodities for biodiesel through its subsidiary PT Elnusa Petrofin, which will trade sodium methylate oxide, a catalyst used in the production of fatty acid methyl ester for biodiesel. The move supports the government’s biodiesel mandate with a 40% crude palm oil (CPO) blend (B40).\n\nNELY announced an interim dividend for fiscal year 2024 of IDR 35.3 billion, or IDR 15 per share. The cum-date is 10 December 2024 on the regular and negotiation markets, with payment on 27 December 2024.

The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that B50 will require 20 million kiloliters of CPO per year, higher than B35 (13.4 million kiloliters) and B40 (16.08 million kiloliters). The government will begin applying B40 in January 2025.\n\nSenior researcher Riyanto from the Institute for Economic and Social Research, University of Indonesia, forecasts that car sales in 2025 will decline by 12% year-on-year to 700,000-750,000 units if a 12% value-added tax (VAT) and vehicle tax surcharge are imposed in January 2025. Toyota Astra Motor’s Vice President Henry Tanoto warned that the tax increase would raise vehicle prices and reduce consumer purchasing power, further shrinking the domestic automotive market. The tax surcharge, collected by local governments on motor vehicle tax, vehicle transfer tax, and mineral tax, is considered an additional tax component. Fiscal Policy Agency analyst Rustam Effendi noted that the surcharge on motor vehicle tax and transfer tax does not need to be a concern as it will not increase taxpayer burden.\n\nCustoms and Excise Director General Askolani announced that the government will soon disclose an increase in the retail price (HJE) of tobacco products, though details were not provided. The Chairman of the Indonesian Cigarette Manufacturers Association, Henry Najoan, expressed hope that the government will not raise HJE or tobacco excise until 2027, as the industry is still recovering from recent excise hikes. He warned that higher HJE amid declining consumer purchasing power could boost illegal cigarette sales.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Industry, Faisol Reza, said the government plans to raise the minimum domestic content (TKDN) requirement for smartphones sold in Indonesia. The exact new TKDN ratio and implementation date have not been set yet. The proposal comes as Apple Inc. is seeking to invest up to USD 100 million to obtain a 40% TKDN certificate for the iPhone 16, after previously offering USD 10 million, which the government rejected as insufficient.\n\nIndonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) Director Irvan Susandy announced that from 9 December 2024, shares listed on the main board, new economy, and development boards will be tradable during the pre-opening session, whereas currently only LQ45 constituent stocks are eligible.\n\nChina’s central bank governor Pan Gongsheng reaffirmed plans to release accommodative monetary policy in 2025 to support economic growth, noting the importance of such policy amid potential US tariff increases on Chinese imports.\n\nJapan’s central bank governor Kazuo Ueda signaled a possible rate hike on 19 December 2024, which would be the first three-time increase in a calendar year since 1989, citing persistent inflation, corporate investment plans, and rising wages.",
