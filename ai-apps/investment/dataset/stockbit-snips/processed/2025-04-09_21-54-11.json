      "title": "RI Sends Proposal for US Tariff Negotiations",
      "content": "The Indonesian Government on Tuesday (8/4) announced its response regarding the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US. In principle, President Prabowo Subianto stated that Indonesia will pursue negotiation routes with the US, including revitalizing trade and investment agreements that have not been updated since 1996. The Indonesian Government is formulating several policies to be offered as a negotiation package with the US, including: Deregulation of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs). Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, stated that the NTMs option was chosen after observing the US rejection of Vietnam's proposal to offer a 0% US import tariff. The US rejection of Vietnam's proposal was because the US also considers non-tariff barriers in its reciprocal tariff negotiations. The NTMs proposed by the Indonesian government include: 1) relaxation of the local content level (TKDN) requirement in the technology, information, and communication (ICT) sector from the US; 2) evaluation of import trade schemes, such as simplification/removal of import quotas/technical licensing; and 3) acceleration of halal certification. Currently, Indonesia imposes a minimum TKDN obligation of 25%, with some ICT products required to have a minimum TKDN of 35%. Increase in Imports from the US. This increase aims to balance Indonesia's trade balance with the US. For context, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus with the US of 19.3 billion US dollars during 2024, which is the fourth largest in Southeast Asia. Going forward, the Indonesian government plans to increase imports originating from the US, covering agricultural products such as soybeans and wheat, engineering equipment, and oil and gas products such as LPG. Currently, the US fulfills 89% of Indonesia's soybean import needs, 5% of wheat, 5% of engineering equipment, and 53% of LPG. Fiscal Incentives. Several incentives are also prepared to facilitate business ease, including for entrepreneurs from the US. Some fiscal incentives prepared include the acceleration and simplification of various taxation processes (such as audits and restitutions) and adjustments to various tariffs (Income Tax on imports, import duties for US products, and export duties for palm oil products). Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that the Indonesian government has sent a letter to the US government regarding this negotiation package. Key Takeaway: Generally, business relaxation in the form of deregulation of TKDN provisions and/or relaxation of import provisions has the potential to increase competition for domestic manufacturers, although it may benefit consumers. Furthermore, the adjustment of various tariffs and duties has the potential to reduce Indonesia's state revenue potential. These various risks could be compensated if Indonesia successfully obtains a negotiation agreement, which could smooth Indonesia's path to increasing its export market share to the US (trade diversion). Investors need to monitor developments and details related to tariff negotiations which are potentially still dynamic. We advise investors to avoid panic selling and stay invested if investors believe that the stocks they invest in have good fundamentals. History shows that the market can recover from crises, such as in 2008 and 2020. Furthermore, having a diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help minimize the impact of market volatility. Investors may consider short-term government bonds that have lower volatility - such as PBS003 and ST014-T2 - or money market mutual funds.",

      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on Tuesday (8/4) decided to increase import tariffs for China by +50 percentage points, bringing the total import tariff imposed by the US on China to 104%, which will take effect from Wednesday (9/4) early morning. This step is a follow-up to China's retaliation against the US reciprocal tariffs. Previously, China was subject to a 20% tariff and a reciprocal tariff of 34%. Responding to this, the Chinese government on Wednesday (9/4) announced an increase in tariffs for imports originating from the US from 34% to 84% effective April 10, 2025, and stated it will sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO). US President, Donald Trump, on Tuesday (8/4) signaled that the US is open to making deals that could reduce or eliminate higher reciprocal tariffs for 57 countries. Trump's statement emerged amidst plans by leaders of countries in Asia and Europe to negotiate with the US government. Nevertheless, Trump proceeded with implementing higher reciprocal tariffs for 57 countries effective Wednesday (9/4) early morning. US President, Donald Trump, on Tuesday (8/4) signed 4 executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry. Based on these orders, Trump used his emergency authority to allow several old coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to continue producing electricity to meet increasing US electricity demand amid growth in data centers, AI, and electric cars. Trump also directed federal government agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, remove barriers to coal mining, and prioritize the leasing of coal mines on US land.",
