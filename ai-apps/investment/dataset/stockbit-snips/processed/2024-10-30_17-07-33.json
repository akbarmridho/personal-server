      "title": "ASII Q3 2024: Solid Net Profit Growth, Exceeding Expectations",
      "content": "Astra International (ASII) posted a strong net profit in 3Q24 of IDR 10 trillion (+21% YoY, +19% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to IDR 25.9 trillion (+1% YoY), exceeding expectations as it reached 84% of the consensus FY24F estimate. Although the net profit was helped by foreign exchange gains and other income totaling IDR 1.7 trillion (vs. 3Q23: profit IDR 769 billion, 2Q24: profit IDR 208 billion), ASII still recorded solid operational performance. Operating profit in 3Q24 rose to IDR 10.9 trillion (+12% YoY, +2% QoQ), resulting in an operating profit for 9M24 of IDR 31.8 trillion (-2% YoY) and equivalent to 80% of the consensus FY24F estimate. This positive operational performance was mainly driven by: 1) the Mining, Construction, and Energy segment under its subsidiary United Tractors (UNTR); and 2) the Financial Services segment. UNTR recorded solid performance. Operating profit from the UNTR segment reached IDR 7.1 trillion (+29% YoY, +0% QoQ) in 3Q24, bringing the UNTR segment's operating profit for 9M24 to IDR 20.9 trillion (-2% YoY). UNTR's performance is considered solid, considering the lower coal prices this year on a YoY basis. Based on its sub-segments, mining contracting (Pamapersada), coal mining, and gold were the pillars of UNTR's performance amidst falling heavy equipment sales. Motor segment outperforms cars. Operating profit from the Financial Services segment grew to IDR 2.2 trillion (+5% YoY, +1% QoQ) in 3Q24, leading to a 10% YoY increase in Financial Services segment operating profit to IDR 6.6 trillion during 9M24. ASII Management mentioned that the growth in this segment occurred along with a +9% YoY increase in consumer financing, especially in motorcycle financing. The solid performance of the motor segment was also reflected in the net profit of PT Astra Honda Motor (AHM) which grew to IDR 3 trillion in 3Q24 (+17% YoY, +24% QoQ), driven entirely by the growth in motorcycle sales volume (+17% YoY, +25% QoQ). Thanks to AHM's strong net profit, ASII's share of profit from associated entities and JVs rose to IDR 2.7 trillion (+4% YoY, +15% QoQ). Meanwhile, the automotive segment recorded weak performance due to sluggish sales volume. Key Takeaway: With this performance exceeding expectations, we expect the consensus to increase ASII's net profit estimates for FY24F, especially for the UNTR segment. Given the lack of an increase in ASII performance estimates from the consensus in the last 3 months, we assess that this 3Q24 performance release will be responded to positively and significantly by the market in tomorrow's trading, Thursday (31/10).",

Meanwhile, credit cost (CoC) during 9M24 deteriorated to 3.39%, primarily driven by an increase in CoC from its subsidiary, PT Permodalan Nasional Madani, for front-loading provisions for the micro business segment.
