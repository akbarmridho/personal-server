      "content": "SKK Migas has released a report on the realization of investment and performance of the upstream oil and gas sector in Indonesia during 2023. Details:\n- Investment grew +13% YoY to USD 13.7 billion, surpassing global upstream oil and gas investment growth of around +6.5% YoY and marking the largest upstream investment in Indonesia in the last 8 years.\n- Oil lifting fell -1.1% YoY to 605.5 thousand barrels of oil per day (MBOPD), equal to 92.5% of the 2023 APBN target and 98% of the SKK Migas 2023 target.\n- Gas flow increased +0.6% YoY to 5,378 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD), equal to 87% of the 2023 APBN target and 96.5% of the SKK Migas 2023 target.\n- During 2023, Indonesia also discovered two giant oil and gas blocks, Geng North and Layaran. Both blocks are among the five largest oil and gas block discoveries worldwide in 2023, and represent the largest Indonesian discoveries since 2000.\n\nSKK Migas Chairman Dwi Soetjipto said the increase in investment in 2023—especially for development well drilling—has been able to reduce the rate of oil production decline and increase gas production in Indonesia.\n\nFor 2024, the following targets are set:\n- Oil lifting of 596 MBOPD based on the SKK Migas 2024 target and 635 MBOPD based on the APBN 2024 target.\n- Gas flow of 5,544 MMSCFD based on the SKK Migas 2024 target and 5,785 MMSCFD based on the APBN 2024 target.\n- Upstream investment to increase +29.2% YoY to USD 17.7 billion.\n\nKey Takeaway\nThe rising trend of upstream oil and gas investment in Indonesia could have a positive impact on service providers in the oil and gas sector through increased work volume and better service rates, ultimately growing revenue and net profit.\n\nOn the IDX, several service providers are $ELSA, $APEX, $WINS, $LEAD, $RUIS, $BBRM, and $HITS. Stockbit also released Mini Unboxing WINS and Mini Unboxing ELSA discussing the prospects and challenges of those two stocks.",
