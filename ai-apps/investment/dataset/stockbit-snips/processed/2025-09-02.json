      "content": "Gold price in the spot market recorded a new all-time high of 3,508.73 US dollars per troy ounce during intraday trading on Tuesday 2 September 2025, later weakening to 3,483.76 US dollars per troy ounce in the afternoon. This represents a 2.56 % increase over the past week and a 32.7 % rise since the start of the year (YTD), surpassing the previous all-time high recorded in April 2025.\n\nThe rally is driven by: 1) strengthening expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut; 2) continued de-dollarisation trends; and 3) persistent geopolitical and macro-economic uncertainty.\n\nAccording to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a US rate cut at the September 2025 meeting rose to 91.8 % today, up from 87.8 % a week earlier. Investor concerns about the Fed’s independence – after President Trump’s pressure on the Fed chair and the dismissal issue of Fed official Lisa Cook – have also eroded confidence in the US dollar. Investors also fear that inflation could rise if a US rate cut is implemented due to political pressure. According to a senior commodity strategist at ANZ, Daniel Hynes, demand for gold is currently elevated by investor worries about inflation risks from a rate cut.\n\nAmid the gold strength, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has weakened 9.3 % YTD to 98.37 on Tuesday 2 September.",

PPOP also fell 7 % YoY during 7M25, although the 7M25 net profit only slipped slightly (-2 % YoY) thanks to a 25 % YoY reduction in provision expenses.
