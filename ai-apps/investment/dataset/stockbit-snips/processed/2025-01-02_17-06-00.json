      "title": "Effective VAT for General Goods & Services Remains 11%",
      "content": "The Government on Tuesday (12/31) announced several important points regarding the increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) effective January 1, 2025: - The VAT increase from 11% to 12% only applies to luxury goods as listed in Minister of Finance Regulation No. 15/2023 and Minister of Finance Regulation No. 42/2022. - Goods and services that have been exempt from VAT experience no change. - General goods and services that have been subject to 11% VAT do not experience an effective VAT increase, so the VAT rate remains 11% of the selling price. Technically, the government is not canceling the 12% VAT rate for general goods and services, but rather by applying a tax base (DPP) of 11/12 of the selling price or import value. This application is regulated in Minister of Finance Regulation No. 131/2024 and will result in the imposition of VAT on general goods and services remaining at 11% of the selling price or import value. As an illustration, a general item with a selling price of 10 million rupiah will have a tax base amounting to 9.17 million rupiah, resulting from 11/12 x 10 million rupiah. This tax base is then subject to 12% VAT, resulting in a total VAT of 1.1 million rupiah. Thus, the effective VAT rate is 11% of its selling price, even though the VAT rate rises to 12%. Based on the simulation above, the amount of VAT paid for general goods and services remains the same. The announcement - especially point 3 - simultaneously revokes the written statement from the Directorate General of Taxes on December 21, 2024, which stated that the VAT increase from 11% to 12% per January 1, 2025, applies to all goods and services previously subject to the 11% rate, with the exception of bulk cooking oil 'Minyakita', wheat flour, and industrial sugar. Furthermore, the government also mentioned that the economic stimulus package announced on December 16, 2024, will remain in effect. Key Takeaway: The cancellation of the VAT increase for general goods and services and the continued validity of the stimulus package have the potential to provide positive sentiment for the consumer sector - especially the lower to middle segments such as ICBP, MYOR, and TSPC - because it can maintain public purchasing power, especially in 1H25. However, there is still a risk of price increases if a number of business actors have already raised selling prices and do not cancel them. Responding to this development, the IHSG closed up +1.18% at the level of 7,163 in today's trading, Thursday (2/1). *This article was first published in Stockbit Commentary on Thursday (2/1) morning.",

      "content": "BPS recorded that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in December 2024 reached 1.57% YoY (vs. November 2024: 1.55% YoY inflation), below the consensus expectation of 1.6% YoY but still within Bank Indonesia's target range of 1.5-3.5%. This is Indonesia's lowest annual inflation in history. On a monthly basis, CPI inflation reached 0.44% MoM (vs. November 2024: 0.3% MoM inflation), in line with expectations and marking the highest increase in the last 9 months. The monthly inflation increase was driven by the food, beverage, and tobacco group which experienced 1.33% MoM inflation, contributing 0.38 percentage point to inflation. Core inflation remained stable at 2.26% YoY, holding at its highest level in the last 16 months although lower than the consensus expectation of 2.28% YoY. S&P Global noted that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.2 in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 49.6), marking the first factory activity expansion since June 2024 along with moderately growing output. New orders in December 2024 increased for the first time in the last 6 months, while overseas sales rose slightly, marking the first increase in almost a year. S&P Global noted that China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.5 in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 51.5), lower than the consensus expectation of 51.7 although it marked factory activity expansion for 3 consecutive months. Production and new order growth slowed, while orders from abroad contracted after increasing at the fastest pace in 7 months the previous month. BPS recorded that foreign tourist arrivals (wisman) to Indonesia reached 1.09 million (-8.4% MoM, +17.3% YoY) in November 2024. This result caused foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia during 11M24 to increase by +20.17% YoY to ~12.7 million, equivalent to 90.4% of the government's 2024 target of 14 million. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, stated on Thursday (2/1) that the 2024 State Budget deficit was below the government's latest estimate of 2.7% of GDP. Although Sri Mulyani did not detail the exact figure, she said the deficit was nearly equivalent to the government's initial plan to keep the 2024 State Budget deficit at 2.29% of GDP. Sri Mulyani mentioned that state revenues generally still grew, although below target. Meanwhile, state expenditures in 2024 grew by more than +6% YoY along with the general election, new capital city development projects, and social assistance programs. US Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, said on Friday (12/27) that the US would hit its debt limit between January 14-23, 2025. Yellen mentioned that the US Congress needs to take 'extraordinary steps' to prevent a US debt default. The Advisory Board of the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association (APNI), Djoko Widajatno, stated that they hope the government does not cut the nickel ore production quota in 2025, considering nickel ore needs will increase this year along with the development of the downstream nickel industry. APNI projects nickel ore needs in 2025 to reach 400-450 million tons, an increase of approximately +60% YoY. Previously, Kontan reported that the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources plans to cut the nickel ore production quota to 150 million tons in 2025, a decrease of -44.9% compared to 2024 production of 272 million tons. Reuters reported on Thursday (2/1) that Indonesia has not implemented biodiesel with a 40% CPO blend, or B40, because industry players are still awaiting technical regulations regarding its launch. Previously, B40 implementation was scheduled for January 1, 2025. The Secretary General of the Indonesian Biofuel Producers Association, Ernest Gunawan, said that its members cannot make contracts for biodiesel distribution without government regulations. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that CPO traders are still waiting for the official volume of biodiesel that Indonesia will allocate to fuel retailers, to gauge how much CPO exports from Indonesia will be affected by this policy. The government previously stated it would allocate 15.62 million kiloliters of palm oil-based fuel for B40 in 2025. Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, stated that the government through Bulog will purchase all harvest yields not absorbed by the market. Additionally, the government officially raised the government purchase price (HPP) for rice from 6,000 rupiah per kg to 6,500 rupiah per kg and corn from 5,000 rupiah per kg to 5,500 rupiah per kg.
