      "content": "Wall Street Journal reported that US President, Donald Trump, informed his senior officials on Tuesday (17/6) that he approved plans for an attack against Iran, although the plan is still postponed pending whether the Iranian government stops its nuclear program. When asked by reporters on Wednesday (18/6) whether he had decided to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump said he has not made a final decision on the matter. Trump also urged Iran again to surrender unconditionally. On Wednesday (18/6), Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that his country would not surrender and warned that US military intervention would bring irreparable consequences. Indonesia, as a country with an open economy, needs to monitor the economic impact and encourage peaceful resolution to maintain global stability. - klinikporto",

      "content": "1. The US central bank, The Fed, on Wednesday (18/6) local time decided to maintain interest rates at the 4.25-4.5% level, in line with consensus expectations, due to uncertainty caused by US tariffs. The Fed still projects US interest rates will fall by 50 bps by the end of 2025, indicating 2 cuts assuming each cut is 25 bps. Although this projection is unchanged from the previous one released in December 2024 and March 2025, the dot plot in the latest projection shows a split vote among Fed members. 2. Bloomberg reported that a group of Indonesian HPAL smelters could experience margin shrinkage due to soaring sulfur prices, which are a key raw material for producing mixed-hydroxide precipitate (MHP). Sulfur prices have more than tripled over the past year, driven by increased demand. According to an analyst at the metal information provider platform SMM Information & Technology Co., Luigi Fan, the surge in sulfur prices will require HPAL smelters to pay approximately 2,500 US dollars more than last year to produce each ton of MHP. Currently, the average cost to produce 1 ton of MHP is about 11,000 US dollars. To produce 1 ton of MHP, producers require 12 tons of sulfur raw material. 3. Palm oil refineries in India canceled orders totaling 65,000 tons of CPO for July-September 2025 shipments due to a sudden surge in the Malaysian benchmark price, according to 4 anonymous sources to Reuters. Nevertheless, the CEO of vegetable oil brokerage firm Sunvin Group, Sandeep Bajoria, estimates that Indian CPO imports will still increase in the coming months, driven by lower inventory due to low import realization in recent months. Indian CPO imports reached a 6-month high in May 2025, driven by low inventory and CPO price discounts compared to soybean oil and sunflower oil. 4. COO of BPI Danantara, Dony Oskaria, said on Wednesday (18/6) that Danantara currently has the authority to inject capital into SOEs, meaning there will no longer be a state capital injection (PMN) mechanism from the government to SOEs. In providing capital injections, Dony explained that Danantara will assess the business plan of the relevant SOE, including forecasting from its industry. 5. Antara reported that the Ministry of Environment and Forestry will impose administrative sanctions on PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) in Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi, for finding violations of environmental regulations within the industrial area. Minister of Environment and Forestry, Hanif Faisol Nurofiq, stated on Wednesday (18/6) that surveillance results showed several facilities were not covered in IMIP's Environmental Impact Analysis (amdal) document. In addition, environmental supervisors found a land clearing of approximately 179 hectares bordering the IMIP area directly. The IMIP industrial area itself stands on 2,000 hectares of land, and currently serves as a center for large industrial activities with 28 companies in operation and 14 companies under construction.",

      "title": "CDIA Subsidiary of TPIA Announces IPO with Valuation of IDR 21-24 Trillion",
      "content": "Chandra Asri Pacificâ€™s ($TPIA) subsidiary, Chandra Daya Investasi ($CDIA), announced it will conduct an IPO by offering up to 12.5 billion (10%) new shares at a price range of 170-190 per share. This implies a target fund acquisition of around 2.1-2.4 trillion rupiah, with a market cap of approximately 21-24 trillion rupiah. CDIA is a subsidiary of TPIA engaged in infrastructure holding in the energy, water, port and storage, and logistics sectors. Currently, the company along with its subsidiaries and associated entities has the following asset coverage: 1. Gas-fired steam power plants (PLTGU) with a capacity of 120 MW and a PLTGU of 200 MW through a joint venture with PT Krakatau Posco, where KCE holds 45%. 2. Krenceng water treatment plant with a capacity of 1,800 liters per second. 3. 72 tanks with a capacity of 130 thousand cubic meters. 4. 7 chemical and gas carrier ships with a capacity of 5,000-8,600 DWT. Shareholder Structure After the IPO, CDIA shareholders will consist of TPIA (60%), Phoenix Power/EGCO Group Thailand (30%), and the public (10%). Valuation After the IPO, CDIA will have a valuation of approximately 42.5-47.5x P/E 2024 and PBV 1.7-1.8x, based on financial reports as of 2024. Financial Performance During 2024, CDIA recorded revenue of US$102.3 million, with a net profit of US$30.6 million. Performance during 2024 increased compared to revenue and net profit for the period of February 8-December 31, 2023, which were US$75.8 million and US$0.18 million, respectively. Use of IPO Funds: 1. 37% for capital contribution to subsidiaries in the logistics business pillar, namely PT Chandra Shipping International and PT Marina Indah Maritim, for ship purchases and operational financing. 2. 63% for capital contribution to subsidiaries in the port and storage business pillar, namely PT Chandra Cilegon Port, for the construction of storage tanks, ethylene pipelines, and other supporting facilities. Key Takeaway When compared to the IPO valuations of CUAN and BREN at the time of IPO, CDIA's P/E IPO valuation is lower than BREN's, although not as low as CUAN's. Meanwhile, based on P/BV, CDIA's IPO valuation is the lowest among the three. From a balance sheet perspective, CDIA has a relatively low gearing (net debt/equity) at the time of IPO. We assess that this ample balance sheet has the potential to drive CDIA's future growth, through organic and inorganic expansion (acquisitions).",
