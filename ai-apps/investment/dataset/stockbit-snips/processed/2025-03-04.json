      "title": "China Announces Countermeasures, Trade War Continues",
      "content": "On Tuesday, March 4, 2025, China announced additional countervailing duties of about 10-15% on U.S. imports effective March 10, 2025, marking the second round of retaliatory tariffs after the 10% duty that took effect on February 10, 2025. The announcement follows the United States’ implementation of an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports, bringing the total U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 20%. In addition, the United States has begun imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico as of today, except for Canadian energy products, which are subject to a 10% tariff. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately imposed a 25% retaliatory duty on U.S. imports worth 30 billion Canadian dollars and warned that a further 125 billion Canadian dollars of U.S. imports could face the same rate if the U.S. does not withdraw the tariffs within 21 days. The Canadian-Mexican tariff regime had previously been delayed for a month while negotiations were underway to strengthen border controls to meet U.S. demands on curbing drug trafficking. President Trump said the drug flow from the two neighboring countries remains \"at a very high level and unacceptable.\" The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, together with the additional duty on China, are only part of President Trump’s broader protectionist agenda that also foresees a 25% duty on steel and aluminium effective March 12, 2025, as well as proposed 25% duties on automobiles, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and timber. In addition, Trump has threatened retaliatory duties against any country that hinders U.S. trade and has recently said he will impose a 25% duty on “automobiles and everything else” from the European Union. Bloomberg reported last week that the scope and timing of these tariff measures remain unclear, including whether commodity-specific duties will be bundled with regional duties or applied separately. On Monday, March 3, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.81% to 106.7, and all major U.S. equity indices closed lower (S&P 500 –1.76%, Dow –1.48%, Nasdaq –2.20%). The weakness preceded China’s tariff announcement. In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed down 2.14% on the day, the 10-year government bond yield was flat at 6.85% (-2 bps) and the rupiah edged up 0.21% to 16,445 per U.S. dollar.",

On the one hand, the additional U.S. duties on other countries could push up prices and inflation in the United States. On the other hand, retaliatory duties on the United States could weaken its exports and the broader economy. Both dynamics are likely to influence the Federal Reserve’s rate-path. For the day, the CME FedWatch Tool shows the probability of a U.S. rate cut of more than 50 basis points in 2025 has risen to 68% from 41% a week earlier.",
