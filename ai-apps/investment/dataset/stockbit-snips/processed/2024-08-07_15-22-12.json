      "content": "IHSG rose +1.16%, ADRO 1H24: Thermal Coal Sales Volume +5% YoY. News Compilation for today. August 7, 2024. IHSG 7,212 +1.16% Coal 150.8 +1.07% Oil (Brent) 77.2 +0.30% Gold 2,435 +0.15% CPO 3,694 -0.30% Nickel 16,385 +0.67% Confused about the meaning of these numbers? Check this out. Stockbitor! The executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, Mohammad Faisal, told Kompas that the household consumption growth (+4.93% YoY) being lower than Indonesia's economic growth (+5.05% YoY) in 2Q24 was influenced by the declining purchasing power of the middle class. Therefore, Faisal stated that the government must be more careful not to issue policies that could further suppress the middle class, such as the plan to increase VAT to 12% and expand excise objects. On the other hand, the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, assessed that the realization of household consumption in 2Q24 was a sufficiently high result. The Chairman of the Commercial Affairs Division of the Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI), Sigit Kumala, said that his party revised the domestic motorcycle sales target for 2024 from the range of 6.2-6.5 million units to 6.2-6.3 million units. This revision was caused by weak domestic motorcycle sales during 1H24, which fell -0.97% YoY to 3.17 million units. Sigit explained that the decline in domestic motorcycle sales was pressured by weakening public purchasing power in line with soaring food inflation and the benchmark interest rate still being at a high level. Kontan reported that business circles and economic observers advised the government to reintroduce income tax (PPh) incentives for employees. This step is aimed at maintaining public purchasing power, especially for the middle class, which has recently continued to weaken. Previously, the government provided borne by the government PPh incentives in April 2020-December 2021 for employees with gross income less than 200 million per year. The Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, stated that the elected president, Prabowo Subianto, plans to announce his cabinet composition on October 21, 2024, or one day after being inaugurated. Bank Indonesia recorded that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves as of the end of July 2024 rose to 145.4 billion US dollars (vs. June 2024: 140.2 billion US dollars). This increase was influenced by the government's issuance of global sukuk as well as tax and service receipts. The position of foreign exchange reserves is equivalent to financing 6.5 months of imports or 6.3 months of imports and government foreign debt payments. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, re-established the policy of imposing safeguard measures import duties (BMTP) on imported fabric, carpet, and other floor covering textile products. These BMTP will start on August 9, 2024, and will be valid for 3 years. This policy previously expired in 2022, but was re-enacted following complaints from the domestic textile industry which found it difficult to compete due to cheap imported products.",

      "title": "EXCL 1H24: Net Profit +58% YoY, Exceeding Expectations",
      "content": "XL Axiata ($EXCL) recorded a net profit of 486 billion rupiah (+8% YoY, -10% QoQ) in 2Q24. This result brought the net profit for 1H24 to 1 trillion rupiah (+58% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equates to 57% of the consensus FY24F estimate. Operationally, EXCL's performance in 2Q24 looked strong with operating profit growth (+12% YoY, +0.3% QoQ). This result caused the operating profit for 1H24 to rise +34% YoY, exceeding expectations as it equates to 53% of the consensus FY24 estimate. Operationally, the number of mobile customers grew to 58.5 million (+1% YoY, +2% QoQ) in 2Q24. Meanwhile, the average revenue per mobile segment customer (ARPU) stabilized at 44 thousand rupiah (+5% YoY, 0% QoQ), even though marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses decreased year-on-year. These results caused EXCL s profitability margin to strengthen during 1H24. EXCL management stated in the earnings call on Wednesday (7/8) that customer growth and ARPU were the results of the company's investment to improve network quality in cities where EXCL's market share is still small. Looking ahead, management expects marketing expenses to increase in 2H24 due to seasonal factors and competition. Furthermore, the company is also preparing to become the market leader in terms of ARPU through a payment integration strategy via the application. Although performance during 1H24 was better than estimates, EXCL management still maintained the FY24 guidance provided at the beginning of the year. This is due to the uncertain business competition situation. The following are details of EXCL management's guidance for FY24: Revenue growth: high single-digit EBITDA Margin: ~50% Capex: 8 trillion rupiah Management also conveyed that EXCL's financial report has not included the fixed broadband business integration factor from Link Net ($LINK) because the timeline can change due to administrative factors. Key Takeaway We assess EXCL's short-term outlook will depend on several factors, such as the execution of the company's strategy in maintaining ARPU growth and customer numbers. EXCL's ARPU gap with competitors which is no longer large (vs. TLKM: 45 thousand rupiah, ISAT: 38 thousand rupiah) in 2Q24 makes growth more challenging. On the other hand, we are also wary of several surprising factors that could influence EXCL's stock price movement in the near term, such as 1) the integration of LINK's revenue and net profit into EXCL's financial statements; and 2) progress in the EXCL and FREN merger development.",
