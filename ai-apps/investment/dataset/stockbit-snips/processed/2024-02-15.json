      "title": "Election Projected to be Single Round, IHSG Strong",
      "content": "Presidential and vice‑presidential candidate pair Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka obtained 56‑59% of the vote in the 2024 election according to quick count results from several survey agencies. Meanwhile, the KPU real count on Thursday (15/2) showed that they received 56.32% of the 43.93% of votes that had been entered.\n\nAlthough the calculations are still provisional, the large margin indicates that the election will likely be concluded in a single round. The result was welcomed positively by market participants and foreign investors, with the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rising +1.3% to 7,303 on Thursday (15/2), where 10 of 11 sectors strengthened.\n\nBased on the provisional quick count from Litbang Kompas on Thursday (15/2), several parties that are part of the coalition supporting Prabowo‑Gibran received more than 4% of the vote and are projected to enter parliament. Those parties are Golkar (14.47%), Gerindra (13.58%), Demokrat (7.59%) and PAN (7.1%). Their combined vote share is only 42.74% and does not reach 50%.\n\nPDI‑P – the party backing the Ganjar‑Mahfud ticket – obtained the largest legislative vote share with 16.97%, according to the Litbang Kompas quick count. PDI‑P is the only party supporting Ganjar‑Mahfud that received more than 4%. Meanwhile, the three parties supporting Anies‑Muhaimin each received more than 4%: PKB 11.29%, Nasdem 9.42% and PKS 8.36%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nSectors and stocks that could benefit from the presidential election result are:\n- Sectors linked to Prabowo‑Gibran program plans:\n  - Free milk program: ULTJ, CMRY\n  - Continuation of the new capital city (IKN) project: PTPP, ADHI, ACST, PANI, PWON\n  - Continuation of downstream processing: ANTM, INCO, NCKL\n- Big banks that receive foreign inflows: BBCA, BBRI, BMRI, BBNI. Note that these stocks already have significant foreign capital and are not cheap.\n- Stocks whose shareholders are perceived by the market to have affiliations with the Prabowo‑Gibran coalition: ADRO, ADMR, MDKA, MBMA, TRIM, ABBA, MARI.\n\nAlthough the market appears enthusiastic about the provisional results, it is important to remember that the positive sentiment may not last long. Investors should continue to monitor fundamentals and valuations of each company.\n\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of the new government's decision‑making in implementing its programs will depend on the coalition's ability to attract other parties in the DPR, given that the coalition's vote share is still below 50%.\n\nRelated stocks: PTPP, ADHI, ACST, PANI, PWON, ANTM, INCO, NCKL, ULTJ, CMRY.",
