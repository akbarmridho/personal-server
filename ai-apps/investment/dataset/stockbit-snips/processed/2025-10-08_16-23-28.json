      "title": "Gold Price Reaches US$4,000/oz, All-Time High",
      "content": "Gold spot prices surged up to 4,050 US dollars per troy ounce during intraday trading on Wednesday (8/10), marking a new all-time high, before easing back to the level of 4,035 US dollars per troy ounce (+1.3%). This marks a gold price increase of +4.4% in the last week. The strengthening of gold prices over the past week was driven by increasing demand for safe haven assets amid uncertainty in the US economy following the government shutdown starting October 1, 2025. The government shutdown itself impacts the postponement of the release of important US economic data from US federal agencies, which The Fed needs to determine the future direction of interest rate policy amidst weakening employment data while inflation remains high. This uncertainty has driven investor interest into gold-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) products, with Bloomberg reporting that the monthly inflow in September 2025 was the largest in over the last 3 years. An analyst strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte. Ltd., Charu Chanana, stated that retail investors and ETFs are now the main drivers for the next stage of gold price movement. Besides the government shutdown, gold demand was also driven by shifts in asset allocation as valuations for AI sector stocks already appear overvalued. The founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, stated his doubt regarding the recent stock market surge, which has triggered concerns about an AI bubble due to sharply rising valuations. Since the beginning of the year (YTD), the price of gold has risen +52%, driven by several factors: 1) uncertainty related to global trade; 2) expectations of interest rate cuts; 3) weakening independence of The Fed which increasingly fuels the de-dollarization trend; and 4) geopolitical tensions. These factors are pushing central banks to continue buying gold in substantial quantities.",

      "content": "Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Tuesday (7/10) that the government plans to push for a mandatory 50% biodiesel mix or B50 in 2026 as an effort to reduce gas oil imports. Previously, Bahlil stated last month that the government could increase the mandatory biodiesel mix to 45% first before moving to B50. The government has completed laboratory tests for the B50 blend in August 2025 and is now ready to conduct road tests. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources noted that the B50 mandate will require 20.1 million kL of palm oil-based biofuel per year, higher than the current B40 which requires 15.6 million kL. Following this news, the price of CPO futures for the December 2025 contract rose +1.7% to 4,546 Malaysian ringgit per ton at the close of the market on Wednesday (8/10), after peaking up to 4,571 Malaysian ringgit per ton intraday. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Tuesday (7/10) that the government is considering mandating a 10% bioethanol content level in gasoline fuel, adding that this plan has been approved by President Prabowo Subianto. This step is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and decreasing reliance on fuel imports. The President Director of PT Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri, mentioned that his company is ready to implement this program. The Indonesian Spirit and Ethanol Producers Association (Apsendo) noted that Indonesia had a bioethanol production capacity of 303,325 kL per year in 2024, but production only reached 160,946 kL with imports of 11,829 kL. Domestic bioethanol demand reached 125,937 kL in 2024, while exports reached 46,839 kL. Gaikindo noted that car wholesale sales in September 2025 only reached 62,071 units (-15% YoY, +0.5% MoM). This result brought wholesale sales during 9M25 to 561,819 units (-11% YoY), equivalent to 62-75% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 9M24: 73% realization in 2024). Bank Indonesia noted that the Indonesian consumer confidence index fell to a level of 115 in September 2025 (vs. August 2025: 117.2, September 2024: 123.5), marking the lowest level since April 2022. This result was driven by declines in almost all sub-indices, except for the employment availability expectation index which rose +0.3 points. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its latest outlook on Tuesday (7/10) projected that global electricity capacity from new and renewable energy will increase by 4,600 GW by 2030. This projection is lower by -5% compared to the previous outlook released in October 2024, following policy changes in the US and China. Nevertheless, the IEA projects that other regions have stronger prospects, with more than 80% of countries worldwide recording faster renewable energy capacity growth in the 2025-2030 period compared to the previous 5-year period. The IEA estimates that 80% of the global increase in renewable energy capacity will come from solar energy due to its low cost and faster permitting process. India is projected to record the second largest new and renewable energy growth after China. Meanwhile, although growth expectations from China have decreased along with the shift from a fixed tariff system to an auction-based one, the IEA predicts China will still dominate renewable energy capacity growth, contributing 60% of the total global growth. Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that his ministry will place the remaining budget surplus (SAL) held at Bank Indonesia to Bank Jakarta and Bank Pembangunan Daerah Jawa Timur (BJTM) in the amounts of approximately 5-10 trillion rupiah each. This step continues the SAL placement policy previously conducted in the state-owned bank cluster (Himbara). Purbaya asserted that placing SAL in regional development banks will not disrupt Bank Indonesia's liquidity or monetary policy. President Prabowo Subianto on Wednesday (8/10) appointed COO Danantara, Dony Oskaria, as the head of the State-Owned Enterprises Regulation Agency (BP BUMN). Dony was previously appointed as the Acting (Plt) Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, before the ministry underwent a nomenclature change. Besides Dony, President Prabowo also appointed Aminuddin Ma'ruf and Tedi Bharata as deputy heads of BP BUMN.",
