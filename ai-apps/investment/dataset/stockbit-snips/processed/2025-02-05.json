      "content": "The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that Indonesia's economy grew by 5.02% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2024 (versus 4Q24: +4.95% YoY), surpassing the consensus estimate of 4.98% YoY. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 0.53% quarter-on-quarter in 4Q24 (versus 3Q24: +1.5% QoQ), slightly below the consensus of 0.56% QoQ. The 2024 annual growth rate therefore amounted to 5.03% YoY (2023: 5.05% YoY), below the government target of 5.2% YoY and marking the slowest growth in three years. The 2024 expansion was driven by household consumption (+4.94% YoY) and gross fixed capital formation (+4.61% YoY), contributing +2.6 and +1.43 percentage points respectively. Net exports contributed a negative 0.01 percentage point due to a rise in imports (+7.95% YoY) that outpaced export growth (+6.51% YoY). Government consumption added +0.48 percentage points (6.61% YoY), with the remaining +0.53 percentage points coming from other variables.",

      "title": "Bank Mandiri FY24 Net Profit +1.3% YoY, Credit +19.5% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded net profit of IDR 13.8 trillion in 4Q24 (-14% YoY, -11% QoQ). This resulted in a full-year 2024 net profit of IDR 55.8 trillion (+1.3% YoY), matching 99% of the FY24 consensus estimate. The performance was supported by: 1) Net Interest Margin (NIM) in line with guidance; 2) Cost of Credit (CoC) at an all-time low; 3) solid credit growth; and 4) rising operating expenses. NIM for the bank-only business improved to 4.95% in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: 4.96%, 3Q24: 4.86%). Consolidated NIM for FY24 was 5.15% (FY23: 5.48%), matching the FY24 guidance range of 5-5.3%. Loan yield rose due to repricing in several credit segments and is expected to stay high at least through H1-25. NIM is pressured by higher Cost of Funds, especially from higher Time Deposit rates. Management targets FY25 NIM of 5-5.2%, roughly in line with FY24 actual and guidance.\n\nCoC fell to an all-time-low 0.79% in FY24 (FY23: 0.85%), better than the FY24 guidance of ≤1% and marking the lowest annual CoC in the company’s history. The result was supported by sound asset quality, with Gross Non-Performing Loans improving to 1.12% (4Q23: 1.19%, 3Q24: 1.13%) and Loan-at-Risk falling below pre-pandemic level to 6.76% (4Q23: 8.62%, 3Q24: 7.51%). Management targets a normalized CoC of 1-1.2% in FY25.\n\nCredit growth was +19.5% YoY in 4Q24 (4Q23: +16.3% YoY, 3Q24: +20.8% YoY), beating the FY24 guidance of +16-18% YoY. Growth was driven by wholesale (+26% YoY), mainly corporate. Third-party funds (DPK) grew only +7.7% YoY, giving a consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio of 98% in 4Q24. BMRI aims to normalize LDR to 90-95% in FY25 and to moderate credit growth to +10-12% YoY.\n\nOperating profit (PPOP) fell to IDR 21.1 trillion in 4Q24 (-6.8% YoY, -9.5% QoQ) as operating expenses surged (+23% YoY, +36% QoQ). General and administrative expenses rose sharply in 4Q24 (+41% YoY, +63% QoQ) and rose +17% YoY for the full year.\n\nKey Takeaway: We assess BMRI’s performance as neutral. The NIM aligned with FY24 guidance is a positive aspect, given that NIM had been a concern in 9M24. Going forward, FY25 liquidity pressures could affect CoF and NIM, especially as the LDR remains high. Management plans to keep the dividend payout ratio at ≥60% for FY24 (2023: 60%), implying a dividend yield of roughly 6.5% based on the Wednesday (5/2) price of IDR 5,525 per share.\n\n*This article was previously released on Wednesday (5/2) afternoon in Stockbit Commentary.*",
