      "content": "Shareholders of Barito Renewables Energy (ticker BREN) affiliated with the controlling shareholder Green Era Pte. Ltd. sold 8.3 million shares, representing approximately 0.006 percent of BREN, at an average price of 9,126 rupiah per share between 11 and 13 August 2025. After the transaction, the ownership stake fell to about 23.597 percent. In a separate transaction, shareholders of Petrosea (ticker PTRO), PT Caraka Reksa Optima, sold 240.9 million shares, representing 2.39 percent of PTRO, at an average price of roughly 2,969 rupiah per share between 8 and 13 August 2025, reducing their ownership to 27.17 percent. Both transactions were intended to increase the free float of the respective stocks.\n\nKey Takeaway: This is not the first time the Barito Group has sold portions of its holdings to raise the free float of its listed companies. Free float market capitalisation (FFMC) is an important factor that can affect weight, flow, and the probability of a stock being included in global indices such as MSCI. Ceteris paribus, a larger free float for a stock not yet in a global index may increase its chances of inclusion. For stocks already in an index, a higher free float can create opportunities for up-weighting, which may attract foreign inflows.",

      "content": "1. LINK: DealStreetAsia reported that the Axiata group is in the final stage of selling its majority stake in Link Net, with a deal value estimated at more than 1 billion US dollars, potentially becoming one of the largest digital infrastructure transactions in Southeast Asia this year. Sources cited by DealStreetAsia named Solusi Sinergi Digital (ticker WIFI) and I Squared Capital as the leading prospective buyers. In addition, the Salim group and Sinar Mas were rumored to be interested, but DealStreetAsia could not verify those reports. I Squared Capital declined to comment, while Axiata, Sinar Mas, and WIFI have not provided comments. As of the end of July 2025, Axiata Investments held a 75.42 percent ownership in LINK, while XLSMART Telecom Sejahtera (ticker EXCL) owned 19.22 percent.\n\n2. KLBF: Management of Kalbe Farma, during an analyst meeting on Thursday (14 August), lowered its 2025 revenue and net profit growth guidance from +8-10 percent year-on-year to +6-8 percent year-on-year. The revision mainly reflects a weakening in the Nutritionals segment, which fell 3 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2025, prompting management to downgrade the segmentâ€™s revenue growth target from mid-single-digit to low-single-digit.\n\n3. MAPI: Management of Mitra Adiperkasa, in its 2Q25 earnings call on Wednesday (13 August), announced that the company has signed a cooperation agreement with Ace Hardware Corp. to bring the brand to Indonesia. However, the opening of Ace Hardware stores is unlikely to occur this year and will be implemented gradually.\n\n4. DSSA: The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources announced that the business entity Dian Swastatika Sentosa, PT Trina Mas Agra Indonesia, plans to increase its solar cell and module production capacity from 1 GWp per year to 3 GWp per year within the next 2-3 years. PT Trina Mas Agra Indonesia is a joint venture between DSSA subsidiary PT Daya Sukses Makmur Selaras, Trina Solar Co. Ltd., and PLN.\n\n5. INCO: The Head of Corporate Finance and Investor Relations of Vale Indonesia, Andaru Brahmono Adi, told Kontan on Wednesday (13 August) that the company has obtained approval for a revised 2025 Work Plan and Budget (RKAB) for the Bahodopi Block. The revision allows the company to ship approximately 2.2 million tonnes of saprolite nickel ore from the block. He added that the first shipment from the block has started and that saprolite sales will provide an additional revenue contribution for INCO in 2025. Previously, Bisnis reported that the revised RKAB enables the company to secure an additional production of about 2 million tonnes of saprolite nickel ore.\n\n6. INTP: Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa reported an 8.2 percent year-on-year decline in cement sales volume in July 2025, although sales rose 21 percent month-on-month due to seasonality in the second half of the year. This resulted in a 3.8 percent year-on-year drop in cement sales volume over the first seven months of 2025 (versus the same period in 2024, which included Grobogan cement and showed a 9.9 percent increase). Market share fell to 29.4 percent (down from 29.6 percent in the prior seven-month period and 29.5 percent in the first half of 2025). Management explained that competitors continued promotional activities and increased sales of fighting brands, while the company remained disciplined in price management.",

      "content": "1. The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 0.49 percent at 7,931 on Thursday (14 August), marking an all-time high, driven by net foreign inflows of 4.9 trillion rupiah over the past week. The rupiah also appreciated 0.52 percent against the US dollar, reaching 16,110, the strongest level since early 2025 and nearly erasing the year-to-date weakening of 0.05 percent.\n\n2. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its August 2025 Oil Market Report projected oil supply growth of 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025 and 1.9 million barrels per day in 2026, each higher than its previous forecast by 370,000 and 620,000 barrels per day respectively. The upward revision reflects additional production from OPEC+ which decided to end part of its output cuts earlier than scheduled. On the demand side, the IEA expects global oil demand to increase by only 680,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 700,000 barrels per day in 2026, each 20,000 barrels per day lower than its earlier outlook, due to subdued consumer confidence.\n\n3. Reuters reported that interest from Chinese companies to expand or set up operations in Indonesia has risen, driven by the United States' 19 percent tariff on Indonesian imports, which is lower than the 30 percent tariff applied to Chinese goods. Although neighboring Malaysia and Thailand also face a 19 percent tariff, Reuters noted that Indonesia enjoys a larger market share advantage. PT Suryacipta Swadaya's Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Abednego Purnomo, told Reuters that the Subang Smartpolitan area is receiving many inquiries from Chinese investors. PT Suryacipta Swadaya operates the Subang Smartpolitan zone and is a subsidiary of Surya Semesta Internusa (ticker SSIA).\n\n4. Cement industry sales volume in Indonesia fell year-on-year to 5.8 million tonnes in July 2025 (down 3.8 percent YoY, up 18 percent MoM), according to management of Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa (ticker INTP). Monthly, sales rose due to second-half seasonality and a higher number of working days in July. The 7-month (January-July) industry volume declined 3.2 percent YoY (versus a 2.5 percent increase when Grobogan cement is included). Weakness was observed both on Java (down 3.1 percent YoY) and outside Java (down 3.3 percent YoY). Management expects that total cement sales in 2025 may not exceed the 2024 realization, revising earlier expectations of up to 2 percent YoY growth. Bag-type cement sales remained flat year-on-year, contributing 72 percent of total sales (up from 70 percent). Bulk cement sales fell 10 percent YoY, reducing its share to 28 percent (down from 30 percent).\n\n5. Cikarang Listrindo (ticker POWR) announced that the company is currently experiencing a gas supply disruption from its suppliers PT Pertamina EP and Perusahaan Gas Negara (ticker PGAS). POWR has taken mitigation steps by using alternative fuels to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to its industrial customers while the gas supply normalizes. The company is also assessing the financial impact of the disruption and is coordinating with gas suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders to maintain operational reliability.",
