      "title": "Nickel Price Breaks US$19,000/Ton, Highest in 2024",
      "content": "Nickel futures for 3 months on the London Metal Exchange increased by +4.1% on Friday (19/4) to the level of 19,326 US dollars per ton, marking the highest level in 2024 and the first time it has broken the 19,000 US dollars per ton level since September 2023. The nickel price itself strengthened by +8.6% WoW last week, with a cumulative increase of +16.4% YTD as of April 22, 2024. Several factors are suspected to be the drivers of the nickel price recently, including: - Trade ban on Russian-made nickel metal products issued by the US and UK governments. With this rule, Russian nickel is no longer traded on the LME and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Russia itself contributes 6% of global refined nickel production. - Delays in the approval of nickel mining RKAB (Work Plan for Mining Operations) in Indonesia, which potentially reduces supply. Indonesia has started implementing the extension of the RKAB validity period from 1 year to 3 years, resulting in permit approval taking longer. - Rumors in the market that Chinese authorities are planning to purchase up to 200 thousand tons of nickel pig iron (NPI) products. The nickel price rally occurred when various parties still expected nickel prices to remain relatively low. In April 2024, ING commodity analyst, Ewa Manthey, predicted that the nickel price would still be suppressed in the short term due to a gloomy macroeconomic outlook and the continuation of global oversupply conditions caused by increased production from Indonesia. Meanwhile, the consensus compiled by Bloomberg projects the average nickel price to be at the level of 17,048 US dollars per ton in 2024. Since the beginning of the year, the average nickel price recorded a level of 16,853 US dollars per ton until April 22, 2024.",

      "content": "The increase in nickel prices after being suppressed to the 15,000 US dollar per ton level at the beginning of 2024 has the potential to impact the increase in Average Selling Price (ASP) enjoyed by nickel producer issuers such as INCO, NCKL, and MBMA. The rise in ASP may lead to an annual increase in revenue, considering that NCKL and MBMA still have significant target annual production increases in 2024. Indonesian nickel producers are also very competitive with lower cost structures. As of 2023, issuers such as INCO and NCKL had cash costs in the range of 10,000 US dollars per ton. If this lower cost structure can be maintained, Indonesian nickel producers can enjoy better profit margins when nickel prices rise, and can continue to survive in situations where nickel prices are weakening. On the closing of the stock exchange on Monday (22/4), a number of nickel producer stocks strengthened, with $NCKL +9.7%, $INCO +0.2%, $ANTM +0.6%, and $MBMA +0.9%.",

In a separate survey compiled by Reuters, the consensus of economists expects Bank Indonesia to maintain the BI Rate at 6% in the Board of Governors Meeting on April 23-24, 2024. The consensus compiled by Reuters also expects the start of Bank Indonesia's interest rate cuts to be delayed from 2Q24 to 3Q24 in line with the hawkish stance from the Fed.",
