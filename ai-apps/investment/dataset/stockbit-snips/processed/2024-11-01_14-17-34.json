Core inflation in October 2024 reached 0.22% MoM and 2.21% YoY (vs. September 2024: 0.16% MoM inflation and 2.09% YoY inflation), exceeding consensus expectations which projected core inflation at 2.1% YoY. On a monthly basis, Indonesia recorded 0.08% MoM inflation (vs. September 2024: 0.12% MoM deflation), ending a streak of monthly deflation over the previous 5 months and higher than the consensus expectation which projected flat. Nevertheless, monthly inflation in October 2024 was mainly driven by the personal care and other services expenditure group at 0.94% MoM, primarily originating from jewelry gold commodities with an inflation contribution reaching 0.06 percentage point.",

      "content": "Although the streak of monthly deflation for the past 5 months has ended, it is important to note that monthly inflation was primarily driven by jewelry gold commodities in line with the global gold price increase of +4.1% MoM during October 2024. Additionally, the continuing trend of declining annual inflation could be a sign that the weakening purchasing power of the public is not yet over. The weakening public purchasing power has been reflected in the revenue decline of consumer goods issuers that act as proxies - such as UNVR and SIDO - due to the downtrading phenomenon. Furthermore, this signal is also occurring in the telecommunications sector with suppressed Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) from TLKM and ISAT. Meanwhile, the downtrading phenomenon could be a positive catalyst for consumer issuers positioned in the 'value' segment, such as Tempo Scan Pacific (TSPC) which recorded solid revenue growth in the company's important segments as we have written in Stockbit Commentary. We have also released Unboxing TSPC which you can read here.",
