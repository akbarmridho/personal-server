      "title": "Indonesian Economy +5.12% YoY in 2Q25, Above Expectations",
      "content": "Statistics Indonesia (BPS) noted that Indonesia's economic growth reached +5.12% YoY in 2Q25 (vs. 2Q24: +5.05% YoY, 1Q25: +4.87% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation which predicted +4.8% YoY. This result positions Indonesia's economic growth for 1H25 at +4.99% YoY. For context, the government targets economic growth at the +5% YoY level based on the revised 2025 State Budget target, while Bank Indonesia's 2025 target – which has been downgraded twice – is in the range of +4.6-5.4% YoY. On a quarterly basis, Indonesia's economic growth increased by +4.04% QoQ (vs. 1Q25: -0.98% QoQ, 2Q24: +3.79% QoQ), also higher than the consensus expectation of +3.7% QoQ. From the expenditure side, 2Q25 economic growth year-on-year was supported by the gross fixed capital formation (GFCF)/investment component which grew +6.99% YoY (vs. 2Q24: +4.42% YoY, 1Q25: +2.12% YoY) driven by government capital expenditure (+30.37% YoY). Meanwhile, household consumption grew +4.97% YoY (vs. 2Q24: +4.93% YoY, 1Q25: +4.95% YoY) along with increased spending on primary needs and public mobility. Based on business fields, the manufacturing sector was the largest contributor to growth with an increase of +5.68% YoY (vs. 2Q24: +3.95%, 1Q25: +4.55% YoY) contributing 1.13 percentage point (vs. 2Q24: 0.79 percentage point, 1Q25: 0.93 percentage point), driven by palm oil products, iron, and steel. The other services sector (+11.31% YoY) and corporate services sector (+9.31% YoY) grew the fastest in 2Q25, driven by an increase in the number of recreational visitors and travel agent/tour operator activities. Spatially, Sulawesi (+5.83% YoY) and Java (+5.24% YoY) recorded the highest growth. Meanwhile, Sumatra (+4.96% YoY), Kalimantan (+4.95% YoY), Bali & Nusra (+3.73% YoY), and Maluku & Papua (+3.33% YoY) recorded growth lower than the national economic growth.",

Revenue in 2Q25 was flat (+0% YoY, +0% QoQ), causing 1H25 revenue to grow +3% YoY, in line with expectations (47% of consensus 2025F estimate) but below the 2025 guidance from management which targeted +5% YoY revenue growth.",
