The result lifted 9‑month net profit to IDR 312 billion (+63% YoY), equal to 59% of Stockbit’s FY24 net‑profit estimate. The 9M23 net profit had been only 43% of FY23 actual. The strong profit was driven by robust revenue and efficient operating expenses. Revenue reached IDR 1.6 trillion in 3Q24 (+83% YoY, +119% QoQ), taking 9M24 revenue to IDR 3.5 trillion (+52% YoY). The company still has a backlog of new contracts worth IDR 2.4 trillion not yet recognized as revenue as of 1H24 and will start to be recognized in 3Q24. Management guided revenue growth of +19‑24% for FY24. Gross‑margin fell to 15.8% in 3Q24 (vs 21% in 3Q23, 19.1% in 2Q24), likely due to a large‑margin‑lower project. Opex was IDR 78 billion (+17% YoY, +6% QoQ), far slower than revenue growth. Other income was IDR 21 billion (3Q23: IDR 1 billion, 2Q24: IDR 4 billion), which the analyst estimates relates to a reversal of a provision for doubtful‑receivables.
