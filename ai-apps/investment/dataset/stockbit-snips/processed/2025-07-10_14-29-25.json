      "content": "Credit analysts from ANZ, Viacheslav Shilin and Ting Meng, told Bloomberg that the large loan size with a short tenor could create payment pressure for Danantara. This situation could increase Danantara's reliance on dividend receipts from quasi-sovereign entities (such as State-Owned Enterprises) and the recurring need for refinancing. This dependency could suppress investor sentiment regarding Indonesian SOE credit. We assess that other details in this loan - such as the interest rate imposed - could be other indications regarding investor confidence in Danantara. For comparison, PT Pertamina Hulu Energi in May 2025 issued a global bond worth 1 billion US dollars with a 5-year tenor and a 5.25% coupon. Furthermore, Bank Mandiri (BMRI) in March 2025 issued a global bond worth 800 million US dollars with a 3-year tenor and a 4.9% coupon.",

      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, stated that the US will start imposing a 50% tariff on copper imports starting August 1, 2025. This is the latest move in Trump's series of tariffs, aimed at encouraging domestic mining and metal processing. Trump previously raised tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and has indicated that sectoral tariff levies for other commodities are being drafted. These tariffs are additions to the country-specific tariffs currently being negotiated by the US with its trading partners, which will also take effect on August 1, 2025. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, on Thursday (10/7), claimed that the meeting between Indonesia and the US regarding tariffs was \"positive\", with both countries exploring a broader partnership in the critical minerals sector. Airlangga met with US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, in Washington on Wednesday (9/7). The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs stated on Thursday (10/7) that the discussions covered tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and commercial partnerships, adding that both countries will intensify talks over the next 3 weeks. President Prabowo Subianto said on Wednesday (9/7) that Indonesia targets switching entirely to renewable energy by 2035, much faster than the previously announced target. As of May 2025, the realization of the New and Renewable Energy (NRE) mix was only 13.21%. Previously, the government had inaugurated the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) for the 2025-2034 period with an additional electricity capacity of 69.5 GW. Of this amount, 42.6 GW or 61% comes from new and renewable energy, 10.3 GW or 15% comes from energy storage capacity, and 16.6 GW or 24% comes from fossil energy such as gas and coal. China's national statistics bureau recorded that China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in June 2025 reached 0.1% YoY, reversing the consecutive deflation trend of 0.1% YoY for the previous 3 months and exceeding consensus expectations which projected no change (flat). This result also marks the first annual inflation since January 2025, driven by e-commerce spending events, increased government subsidies for consumer goods, and efforts to de-escalate trade with the US. Nevertheless, China recorded deflation of 0.1% MoM (vs. May 2025: deflation of 0.2% MoM). Meanwhile, core inflation rose to 0.7% YoY (vs. May 2025: 0.6% YoY inflation), marking its highest level in the last 14 months. Prima Multi Usaha Indonesia (PMUI) officially listed on the IDX on Thursday (10/7) with a price of 180 rupiah per share and closed down -15%, hitting the lower auto-rejection limit (ARB) at 153 rupiah per share. Investor Daily reported that PMUI did not experience oversubscription during the offering period, with total participation reaching only about 46 thousand investors.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara has appointed 4 banks - consisting of DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis SA, and Standard Chartered Plc - as coordinators to secure a multi-currency loan of up to 10 billion US dollars. This loan facility has the potential to be the largest loan in Southeast Asian history, according to the Bloomberg report. Bloomberg previously reported that Danantara was targeting the loan facility with a 3-5 year tenor, intended for general corporate purposes. Bloomberg also reported that the loan will be unsecured and without any guarantee, and not accompanied by a letter of support or statement from the government. Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, stated that Danantara is projected to manage Rp 150 trillion in dividends in 2025, equivalent to 9.2 billion US dollars assuming an exchange rate of 16,220. On the expenditure side, Danantara only plans to disburse investment valued at 5 billion US dollars until the end of 2025, according to Danantara's Managing Director of Finance, Arief Budiman. In June-July 2025, Danantara has signed several collaborations [see table]. Furthermore, Danantara is also reportedly exploring potential collaborations with various parties, including: 1. Geothermal Development with PGEO - Danantara was reported to be cooperating with Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGEO) regarding geothermal energy development amounting to 3 GW, although the investment value is not yet known. 2. Involvement in Critical Minerals Projects with the US - Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that Danantara will be involved in critical mineral projects offered by Indonesia to the US. 3. Rumor of Acquisition of GOTO Minority Shares - Bloomberg reported that Danantara is in discussions with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia (GOTO) to acquire minority shares in the merged entity between Grab and GOTO. Nevertheless, the plan for a merger between Grab and GOTO was reported to face regulatory hurdles.",
