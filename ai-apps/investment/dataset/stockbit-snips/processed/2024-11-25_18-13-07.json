      "title": "Elections and Policy Discussion on Tax Amnesty and Housing Subsidies",
      "content": "President-elect of the US, Donald Trump, on Friday (11/22) said that he would nominate Scott Bessent as US treasury secretary. Bessent spent his career in finance, having worked for George Soros and Jim Chanos before running his own hedge fund. Reuters reported that Bessent is a supporter of tax reform and deregulation, with some analysts seeing his appointment as potentially reducing the likelihood of high import tariffs as mooted by Trump. Kontan reported that the plan for the 3rd tax amnesty rule will not be much different from the previous tax amnesty rules in 2016-2017 and 2022. Kontan sources in parliament said that this 3rd tax amnesty will target shadow economy activities, namely legal and illegal economic activities that are not reported for tax purposes. On the other hand, tax observer from the Center for Indonesia Taxation Analysis, Fajry Akbar, doubted that shadow economy actors will want to participate in the tax amnesty. Therefore, Fajry asked the government and DPR to scrap the tax amnesty discourse because it has the potential to create moral hazard and can damage the government's image and credibility. The government on Monday (11/25) officially abolished the Land and Building Rights Acquisition Fee (BPHTB) and Building Permit Approval (PBG) for low-income communities. This policy aims to curb housing prices and accelerate the realization of the 3 million homes per year program.",

      "content": "IDX Director, Iman Rachman, said that the exchange is considering minimum IPO proceeds requirements as part of efforts to overhaul listing rules. Iman mentioned that the IDX has begun to encourage companies with equity over 2 trillion Rupiah to ensure that their IPO proceeds are at least 10% of the total company valuation, instead of the current minimum 10% free float. Iman stated that this plan to change the rule is being discussed with the OJK and is likely to be approved in early 2025. The IDX's plan to revise listing rules emerged after FTSE Russell removed Barito Renewables Energy (BREN) from its index inclusion plan in September 2024 due to high shareholder concentration. Kontan reported that the Aircraft Ticket Price Reduction Task Force is planning 3 new incentives to suppress air ticket prices, namely: 1) cutting the fuel surcharge for jet aircraft from 10% to 2% during December 19, 2024-January 3, 2025; 2) cutting the fuel surcharge for propeller aircraft from 25% to 20% during December 19, 2024-January 3, 2025; and 3) not increasing jet fuel prices throughout December 2024 or providing a discount of 7.5-10%. The plan for these 3 incentives is in addition to the incentive of cutting airport passenger service charges by 50% during December 19, 2024-January 3, 2025. The Task Force hopes these incentives can reduce air ticket prices by 10-13% during the Christmas and New Year (Nataru) period.",

      "title": "BBRI's October 2024 Net Profit Decreased YoY and MoM, Driven by Rising Credit Cost and Lowered NIM",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded a net profit (bank only) of 4.1 trillion Rupiah (-8.2% YoY, -26% MoM) in October 2024, bringing the bank only net profit for 10M24 to 45.7 trillion Rupiah (+5.3% YoY). On the negative side, credit cost (CoC) increased again and Net Interest Margin (NIM) decreased. Meanwhile, on the positive side, operating expenses (opex) remained under control. CoC Increased Again: After showing improvement in the last 2 months, BBRI's CoC (bank only) in October 2024 rose again to 3.15% (+131 bps YoY, +38 bps MoM), although not as high as the CoC in May and July 2024 at 3.8-3.9%. This result caused the CoC for 10M24 to increase to 3.19% (vs. 10M23: 2.57%), worse than management's consolidated FY24 guidance aiming for a maximum of 3%. The increase in CoC was accompanied by a growth in provision expenses in October 2024 to 3.2 trillion Rupiah (+83% YoY, +15% MoM), resulting in provision expenses for 10M24 reaching 31.6 trillion Rupiah (+36% YoY). The increase in provision expenses in October 2024 weighed down the monthly net profit, considering that operationally, Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) (bank only) still reached 8.5 trillion Rupiah (+19% YoY, -11% MoM). NIM Weakened: BBRI's NIM (bank only) in October 2024 fell to 6.28% (-12 bps YoY, -20 bps MoM), after experiencing an increasing trend in previous months. This result caused BBRI's NIM for 10M24 to drop to 6.34% (vs. 10M23: 6.73%). The decrease in NIM during 10M24 occurred along with a shift to an asset mix with smaller yields, with placements at Bank Indonesia increasing +17% YoY during 10M24 while placements in securities (including government bonds) decreased -8.6% YoY. Efficiency Maintained: On the other hand, BBRI was still able to maintain its operational efficiency trend with opex decreasing to 5.4 trillion Rupiah (-2.8% YoY, +19% MoM) in October 2024, driven by lower labor costs. During 10M24, opex only grew +4.4% YoY to 48.6 trillion Rupiah, which helped PPOP increase by +15% YoY to 89.5 trillion Rupiah. Key Takeaway: Although CoC increased again in October 2024, we tend to wait and see to determine whether this is more due to the company's front-loading causing CoC to normalize by year-end, or if it is a sign of deteriorating asset quality. Furthermore, market concerns about BBRI also focus on the performance of its subsidiary, PT Permodalan Nasional Madani, whose performance cannot be seen from the bank only performance.",
