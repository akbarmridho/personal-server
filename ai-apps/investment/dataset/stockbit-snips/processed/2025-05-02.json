      "title": "US Economy Weakens, Trade War Sentiment Eases",
      "content": "US economy contracted by 0.3% annualized in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: +2.4% annualized), according to the advance estimate from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. This result is far below the consensus expectation of +0.3% annualized and marks the first contraction since 1Q22.\n\nOn a year-over-year basis, the US economy still grew +2% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: +2.5% YoY), but this is the first slowdown since 4Q22. The weakness was driven by a surge in imports of +41.3% QoQ and +13.4% YoY, as companies stocked up in anticipation of higher tariffs.\n\nOn the other hand, trade-war sentiment between the US and China has begun to ease. On Friday (2 May), the Chinese government said it was evaluating the possibility of tariff negotiations with the US. However, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce stressed that it would only negotiate if the US first cancelled tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nFollowing the positive sentiment from the potential de-escalation of the trade war, gold prices fell to $3,260 per troy ounce on Friday (2 May), after reaching an all-time high of $3,423 per troy ounce on 21 April 2025. The US Dollar Index (DXY) also improved by +0.35% week-over-week to 99.82 on Friday (2 May), after briefly dropping to a March-2022 low of 98.27 on 21 April 2025.\n\nIn Indonesia, the rupiah strengthened by +2.35% week-over-week to 16,435 per US dollar on Friday (2 May), improving from its all-time low of 16,870 on 24 April 2025. On the same day, the IDX Composite (IHSG) rose by +0.72% and the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield fell by about 5 basis points to 6.88%.\n\nKey Takeaway: Prospects of US-China trade negotiations could make the US economic slowdown smoother than previously feared, providing a risk-on sentiment for markets, especially emerging markets. However, the flow of capital from the US market will still depend on each country’s growth outlook. Domestically, a more stable rupiah could give Bank Indonesia room to cut the BI Rate to support economic growth.",

      "content": "1. Reuters surveyed economists expect Indonesia's economy to slow to +4.91% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24 actual +5.02% YoY). Quarterly, economists forecast a contraction of -0.89% QoQ in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24 actual +0.53% QoQ). The outlook reflects higher global trade uncertainty and lower government spending in 1Q25. Indonesia's Q1 2025 GDP data will be released on 5 May 2025.\n\n2. BPS reported that Indonesia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose to 1.95% YoY in April 2025 (vs. March 2025: 1.03% YoY), the highest since August 2024, driven by Lebaran effects. Monthly, CPI inflation eased to 1.17% MoM (vs. March 2025: 1.65% MoM). Core inflation increased to 2.5% YoY (vs. March 2025: 2.48% YoY), the highest in 22 months.\n\n3. S&P Global noted that Indonesia's Manufacturing PMI fell to 46.7 in April 2025 (vs. March 2024: 52.4), marking the first contraction in six months and the steepest decline since August 2021.\n\n4. The Ministry of Finance recorded that the 2025 state budget deficit reached 104.2 trillion rupiah or 0.43% of GDP as of 1Q25. Nevertheless, the primary balance remained in surplus at 17.5 trillion rupiah. The 2025 budget targets a deficit of 2.53% of GDP and a primary deficit of 63.3 trillion rupiah.\n\n5. S&P Global reported that China's Manufacturing PMI dropped to 50.4 in April 2025 (vs. March 2025: 51.2) but stayed above the consensus of 49.8. This indicates an expansion for the seventh consecutive month, albeit the weakest growth since January 2025, reflecting continued stimulus support.\n\n6. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that US job openings fell by 288,000 to 7.19 million in March 2025 (vs. February 2025: 7.48 million), below the consensus of 7.48 million and marking the lowest level in six months.\n\n7. Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN) reported a net profit of 34 million USD in 1Q25 (+19% YoY, -5% QoQ). The YoY profit increase was mainly due to a reduction in net financial expenses to 26 million USD (-8% YoY, -8% QoQ) after refinancing in September 2024, and a favorable currency exchange gain of 1 million USD (1Q24: loss of 1 million USD, 4Q24: gain of 2 million USD). Stockbit calculated EBITDA of 126 million USD in 1Q25 (+3% YoY, -5% QoQ).\n\n8. Prabowo Subianto's adviser, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, told Reuters that the government plans to build 10 GW of nuclear power plants, part of a target to add 103 GW of capacity by 2040. The additional capacity will consist of 75 GW from solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, and 18 GW from gas. Indonesia currently has 90 GW of installed capacity, with only 15 GW from renewable sources.\n\n9. BPS reported that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia reached approximately 841,000 in March 2025 (-2.2% YoY, -5.6% MoM). This brought total Q1 2025 foreign arrivals to about 2.7 million (+7.8% YoY), representing 17-20% of the 2025 government target of 14-16 million.\n",

Revenue grew YoY to 2.1 trillion rupiah (+7% YoY, -9% QoQ), in line with the consensus (23% estimate) and above the guidance targeting +5% YoY revenue growth.
