      "title": "Property Sector: 2024 Marketing Sales Compilation",
      "content": "Several residential property issuers have announced their marketing sales realization throughout 2024, including Ciputra Development ($CTRA), Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua ($PANI), Summarecon Agung ($SMRA), Alam Sutera Realty ($ASRI), Bangun Kosambi Sukses ($CBDK), and Pakuwon Jati ($PWON). Throughout 2024, a number of issuers managed to exceed their marketing sales targets, such as ASRI (113%) and PWON (104%). Issuers that recorded marketing sales according to target include CTRA and PANI. Note that PANI revised up its marketing sales target from 5.5 trillion rupiah to 6 trillion rupiah, as we estimated in [1H24]. Meanwhile, the marketing sales realization for CBDK and SMRA was lower than the target, at 82% and 87% of the target, respectively. Of these 6 issuers, 2 have announced their marketing sales targets for 2025, namely SMRA at 5 trillion rupiah (+14.5% from 2024 realization) and PWON at 1.8 trillion rupiah (+15.8% from 2024 realization). Key Takeaway: In general, although 2024 was an election year, residential property issuers were able to maintain or achieve growth in their annual marketing sales. We believe that this result can be linked to the Government Borne VAT (PPN DTP) incentive of 100% which lasted for 10 months (January-June and September-December). Several issuers also reported the contribution of PPN DTP to their total marketing sales during 2024, namely PWON by 59% and CTRA by 27%. For 2025, we assess that positive sentiment for the property sector may continue along with the extension of 100% PPN DTP and the prospect of an interest rate cut by Bank Indonesia. The 100% PPN DTP will continue until June 2025, before its portion decreases to 50% in July-December 2025. Based on Bloomberg, consensus estimates that the BI Rate will still be cut by 50 bps or 2 more times to the level of 5.25% by the end of 2025.",

      "title": "Fed Holds Rates Steady, China Coal Imports Plummet, Axiata-Sinar Mas MOU, China PMI Drops, Honda Motorcycle Targets, Insider Trades, and Nvidia Market Cap Plunge Summary",
      "content": "The US central bank, The Fed, decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate at the level of 4.25-4.5% in the meeting on Wednesday (29/1), in line with consensus expectations. The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, said that they are not in a hurry to lower interest rates, adding that the current rate hold step is intended to further observe the impact of the series of interest rate cuts in 2024 on inflation. Powell also mentioned that the US economy remains strong and interest rates are no longer holding back the economy as much as before. Strong US economic growth, coupled with a solid labor market, also gives The Fed time to evaluate how President Donald Trump's policies might affect the economy. The analysis firm, Kpler, estimates that China's sea-borne coal import volume in January 2025 reached only 27.97 million tons, down -26% MoM and marking the lowest level in almost the last 4 years. Although historically China's coal imports weaken in January and February along with the end of the peak of winter, the estimated decline is much greater compared to the realization in January 2024 (-9% MoM) and January 2023 (-10.9% MoM), pressured by increasing domestic supply. This has led to weakening imported coal prices, with the commodity price reporting agency Argus noting that Indonesian coal prices with an energy content of 4,200 kcal/kg reached only 48.76 US dollars per ton in the week ending January 24, 2025, marking the lowest level since April 2021. Axiata Group Berhad and Sinar Mas on Tuesday (28/1) announced a memorandum of understanding to explore and enhance various strategic collaborations. This cooperation aims to boost the region's digital economic growth through 5G innovation, business solutions, digital infrastructure, and fintech. The Chinese national statistics bureau recorded that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in China fell to 49.1 in January 2025 (vs. December 2024: 50.1), lower than the consensus expectation of 50.1. This result marks the first contraction of factory activity since September 2024 and is the sharpest decline in the last 5 months, pressured by sluggish factory activity ahead of the Lunar New Year. Nevertheless, confidence increased to 55.3 (vs. December 2024: 53.3), marking the highest level in the last 10 months. Honda Motor Co. (TYO: 7267) targets to control 50% of the global motorcycle market share, including electric motorcycles, although the company did not provide details on the timeframe when this target will be achieved. Honda itself targets motorcycle sales growth to be supported by developing countries - primarily India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, and other countries in South and Central America. For the fiscal year ending March 2025, Honda estimates its motorcycle sales to reach 20.2 million units, equivalent to 40% global market share. Going forward, Honda predicts global motorcycle industry sales - both conventional and electric - will reach 60 million units per year by 2030.",
