      "title": "Oil Spikes After Biden Mentions Possibility of Israel Attacking Iran",
      "content": "Crude oil prices in the futures market surged +5.03% to USD 77.62 per barrel in trading on Thursday (3/10) night after US President Joe Biden stated that the US and Israel were discussing the possibility of attacking Iranian oil facilities. The strengthening continued on Friday (4/10), with Brent crude oil prices in the futures market rising +1.12% to USD 78.5 per barrel. BBC reported that Biden made this statement while leaving the White House and it did not clearly describe the US government's stance. Biden previously stated that he would not support an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. Biden's statement came just one day after an anonymous Israeli official told Axios that Israel would launch a retaliatory strike, likely targeting Iranian oil production facilities and other strategic locations. Previously, Iran launched its largest attack on Israel on Tuesday (1/10), intended as retaliation for Israel's offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon last weekend. Iran itself is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with production reaching 3.7 million barrels per day in August 2024, or about 4% of total global production. Key Takeaway: As previously written in Stockbit Snips, oil prices in the short term will depend on geopolitical developments. According to the Head of Commodity Analysis at Swedish bank SEB, Bjarne Schieldrop, oil prices have the potential to surge up to USD 200 per barrel if all of Iran's oil infrastructure is destroyed. Oil and gas supporting issuers' stocks strengthened again today, Friday (4/10), with MEDC +3.65%, ENRG +6.19%, ELSA +3.24%, LEAD +4.0%, and WINS +1.67%, driven by the sentiment of rising oil prices. This article was first released in Stockbit Commentary.",
