      "content": "The Ministry of Finance on Monday (9/22) presented the realization of the State Budget until August 2025. Here are some key points: State Revenue Remains Contracted, Below Seasonal Trend State revenue during 8M25 reached 1,638.7 trillion Rupiah (-7.8% YoY), equivalent to only ~57% of the 2025 State Budget outlook (vs. 8M24: ~63% realization of the 2024 State Budget). Tax revenue - which is the main contributor to state revenue - still experienced a decrease of -5.1% YoY during 8M25. The Ministry of Finance attributed the decline in tax revenue to the restitution factor, considering that gross tax revenue still rose +2.1% YoY during 8M25. State Expenditure Accelerated, Relatively in Line with Seasonal Trend State expenditure during 8M25 reached 1,960.3 trillion Rupiah (+1.5% YoY), equivalent to ~56% of the 2025 State Budget outlook (vs. 8M24: ~58% realization of the 2024 State Budget). Both central government spending (+1.5% YoY) and transfers to the regions (+1.7% YoY) recorded positive growth. The trend of state expenditure also showed an acceleration compared to previous months. For comparison, state expenditure during 1H25 only grew +0.6% YoY, while the realization for 5M25 was still down -11% YoY. The Ministry of Finance also reported that as of September 8, 2025, the realization of the Free Nutritious Meal program had reached 22.71 million beneficiaries with a budget realization of approximately 13 trillion Rupiah, equivalent to only 18.3% of the budget ceiling in the Ministry of Finance presentation of 71 trillion Rupiah. Previously, Finance Minister Purbaya, stated that his party would continue to monitor the realization of government program budgets and reallocate the budget if realization was slow. The 2025 State Budget realization during 8M25 resulted in a deficit of 321.6 trillion Rupiah or equivalent to 1.35% of GDP (vs. 8M24: 0.69% of GDP).",

      "content": "The DPR on Tuesday (9/23) ratified the 2026 State Budget Law (UU APBN 2026) with a target deficit of 2.68% of GDP and an economic growth target of +5.4% YoY. The 2026 State Budget also targets inflation at 2.5% YoY, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar at 16,500, the 10-year SBN yield at 6.9%, the Indonesian Crude Price at 70 US Dollars per barrel, oil lifting at 610 thousand barrels per day, and gas lifting at 984 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Indonesia and the European Union on Tuesday (9/23) signed the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA) in Bali. This agreement will eliminate tariffs for 80% of Indonesian products exported to the European market, including flagship commodities such as palm oil, fisheries, and textile products. Meanwhile, Indonesia will eliminate import duties on 98.5% of goods from the European Union, including cars and food products, and simplify entry procedures for European Union products. The Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Airlangga Hartarto, targeted this agreement to take effect on January 1, 2027. The government expects exports to the European Union to double in the first 5 years of the agreement's implementation. The Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Monday (9/22) that the government will extend the Value Added Tax borne by the Government (PPN DTP) incentive of 100% for the housing sector until 2026. Under this scheme, the government will fully bear the VAT on the purchase of new ready-to-occupy houses with a maximum selling price of 2 billion Rupiah. For properties priced around 2-5 billion Rupiah, the VAT exemption only applies to the first 2 billion Rupiah. Kontan reported that the government has prepared a ceiling for the 2026 PPN DTP incentive of 3.4 trillion Rupiah, targeting 40,000 units of new houses. Bank Indonesia recorded that the economy's liquidity, or broad money supply (M2), in August 2025 grew +7.6% YoY to 9,657.1 trillion Rupiah (vs. July 2025: +6.6% YoY). This development was driven by the growth of narrow money supply (M1) of +10.5% YoY and quasi money of +5.6% YoY. The DPR on Tuesday (9/23) approved Anggito Abimanyu as the chairman of the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) board of commissioners for the 2025-2030 period, replacing Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa who was appointed Minister of Finance. Anggito currently serves as Deputy Minister of Finance. Kontan reported that Anggito's name was not included in the list chosen by the LPS selection committee in July 2025, but his name later appeared in a letter sent by President Prabowo Subianto to the DPR. Purbaya confirmed that Anggito will relinquish his position as Deputy Minister of Finance after being officially named Chairman of the LPS Board of Commissioners.",
