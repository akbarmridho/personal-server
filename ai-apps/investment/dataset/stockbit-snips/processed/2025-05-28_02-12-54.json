      "title": "BMRI & BBNI 4M25: Bank Only Net Profit Flat",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri and Bank Negara Indonesia recorded a decrease in net profit in April 2025 due to the shift in Eid al-Fitr seasonality. BMRI's bank-only net profit decreased by -10% YoY and -12% MoM, while BBNI's bank-only net profit decreased by -5% YoY and -28% MoM. During 4M25 (January to April 2025), the net profit of both bank-only operations was relatively flat, with BMRI at +1% YoY and BBNI at +0% YoY. BMRI's performance in 4M25 was relatively in line with consensus expectations which forecasted consolidated net profit growth of +1.5% YoY, while BBNI's performance was below consensus expectations which forecasted consolidated net profit growth of +4% YoY in 2025F. NIM Under Pressure During 4M25, BMRI's NIM dropped to 4.26% (vs. 4M24: 4.64%), while BBNI's NIM was relatively flat at 3.69% (vs. 4M24: 3.68%). Both were below the 2025 guidance from their respective managements. The growth of their Net Interest Income (NII) was relatively low - with BMRI +6% YoY and BBNI +3% YoY - following an increase in interest expense that was higher than interest income, as well as a decline in loan yield. Loan growth continues to slow down along with initiatives to balance growth with profitability (NIM). BMRI's loan growth grew +15% YoY as of April 2025, slowing down from the range of +19% YoY at the beginning of 2025 and moving toward the 2025 guidance from management in the range of +10-12% YoY. Meanwhile, BBNI's loan growth decreased to +8% YoY as of April 2025, within the lower bound of management's 2025 guidance (+8-10% YoY). BBNI's Total Deposits (DPK) decreased by -1% YoY as of April 2025, driven by a decrease in time deposits (-7% YoY), whereas BMRI's DPK growth as of April 2025 was actually more driven by time deposits (+23% YoY) despite decent CASA growth (+12% YoY). The difference in appetite for time deposits may indicate that BMRI is not as bullish as BBNI regarding the expected improvement in liquidity conditions in 2H25. PPOP and Bottomline Flat Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) for both was relatively flat in 4M25. BMRI's solid increase in Non-Interest Income (Non-II) (+15% YoY) was offset by a significant increase in opex (+26% YoY), so that NII growth of +6% YoY only resulted in PPOP declining by -1% YoY. Meanwhile, BBNI's Non-II only grew +2% YoY with opex rising +6% YoY, resulting in PPOP growing only +1% YoY. BMRI's provision expense in 4M25 decreased by -9% YoY, while BBNI was relatively flat (+1% YoY). This resulted in both banks' Cost of Credit (CoC) in 4M25 being recorded below 1%, each better than the 2025 guidance from management.",

      "content": "Liquidity remains a challenge weighing on the Net Interest Margin (NIM). On a positive note, Cost of Credit (CoC) is still maintained below the 2025 guidance from each respective management. BMRI and BBNI managements previously expected that NIM would tend to be weak during 1H25 before strengthening again in 2H25 as liquidity loosens. Some catalysts that can enhance banking liquidity are 1) interest rate cuts and secondary reserve adjustments by Bank Indonesia, 2) capital inflows into Indonesia; and 3) acceleration of government spending.",

      "content": "1. Bloomberg reported that a group of energy traders handling Indonesian thermal coal exports requested a replacement of the local Coalindo index in the formation of the Indonesia Coal Index (ICI) price, which they claim is pushing Indonesian coal prices higher compared to other reference prices. The Coalindo index itself accounts for half of the ICI weight, while the other part of the ICI price assessment comes from the UK-based Argus Media Ltd. Traders told Bloomberg that the ICI coal price with a GAR 3,800 value was +5% higher compared to the price reference provided by Argus on May 16, 2025. This indicates that part of the ICI price is driven up by the higher Coalindo assessment. Traders noted that this price distortion has widened since February 2025. 2. Bloomberg reported that China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao and the European Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security Maros Sefcovic will meet next month. This is the 3rd meeting between Wang and Sefcovic since the beginning of 2025, with Bloomberg reporting that this indicates both sides will increase their engagement to counter tariff pressures from the US. 3. The area of soybean planting in India is likely to decrease this year because corn and sugarcane may replace it in some areas due to higher profits, according to farmers and industry officials in India to Reuters. Soybean is the main oilseed crop for India, usually planted during the summer season. Potential lower production of soybean oil may force India - the world's largest vegetable oil importer - to increase its procurement of CPO, soybean oil, and sunflower oil from abroad. India imports CPO from Indonesia and Malaysia. 4. US President, Donald Trump, stated on Monday (5/26) that he is considering imposing more sanctions on Russia, although he did not provide further details. Trump's statement came in response to the massive airstrikes by Russia against Ukraine over the last 3 days. 5. Minister of State Apparatus Utilization and Bureaucratic Reform, Rini Widyantini, stated on Monday (5/26) that the Indonesian Civil Servants Corps (Korpri) had not coordinated with the government before the state apparatus organization proposed an extension of the ASN retirement age. Previously, Korpri proposed that the ASN retirement age be changed to a range between 59-70 years. Responding to this, Rini stated that Korpri's proposal must be carefully reviewed and needs to consider productivity, career development, and competency development. 7. Bank Pembangunan Daerah Jawa Timur (BJTM) will distribute dividends for the 2024 fiscal year amounting to ~821.5 billion rupiah or 54.71 rupiah per share. This amount is equivalent to a ~64% dividend payout ratio (vs. 2023: ~56%) and indicates a dividend yield of 9.7% as of Tuesday (5/27). The cum date in the regular and negotiation markets is June 3, 2025, while the payment date is June 19, 2025.",
