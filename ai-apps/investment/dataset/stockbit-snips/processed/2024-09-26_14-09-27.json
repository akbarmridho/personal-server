      "title": "IHSG Minor Evaluation: AMMN Weight Rises, BBRI Falls",
      "content": "The IDX on September 24, 2024 announced the results of the minor evaluation for the IHSG index for the effective period of October 1-December 31, 2024. This evaluation includes changes in the weights of several stocks in the index, with Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN) experiencing the most significant weight increase of +1.41 percentage point to reach 5.42%. On the other hand, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) experienced the largest weight decrease of -0.96 percentage point to 9%. To determine the weight of a stock in the IHSG, the IDX uses the free float adjusted index and applies a maximum cap of 9%. In the previous evaluation in June 2024, BBRI received a weight increase from 6.75% to 9%. However, the rise in BBRI's stock price over the last 3 months caused its weight to increase to 9.96% before the September 2024 evaluation was conducted. The decrease in BBRIâ€™s weight in the September 2024 evaluation was driven by the application of the 9% maximum cap. Previously, the number of BBRI free float shares calculated in the June 2024 evaluation was 60 billion shares, equivalent to the 9% maximum weight cap at that time. However, the number of BBRI free float shares calculated in the September 2024 evaluation dropped to 54.6 billion shares and had already reached the maximum weight of 9%. Besides AMMN, the issuers experiencing the largest weight increases in the September 2024 evaluation were AMRT (+0.20 percentage point) and BNLI (+0.12 percentage point). On the other hand, the issuers experiencing the largest weight decreases after BBRI were BMRI (-0.10 percentage point) and TLKM (-0.06 percentage point). The next evaluation of the IHSG index will be conducted in December 2024, with an effective period of January 1-March 31, 2024.",

Since the announcement of the latest index weighting on September 24, 2024, BBRI's stock price has fallen by about -9% as of September 26, 2024, with foreign outflow reaching 4.1 trillion rupiah. As a note, there are still BBRI free float shares that have not been calculated for IHSG weighting. Therefore, if BBRI's weight decreases in the future due to a drop in stock price, BBRI's weighting may rise again.",
