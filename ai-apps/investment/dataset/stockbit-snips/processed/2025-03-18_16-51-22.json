      "title": "BEI Implements Trading Halt, First Time Since Late 2020",
      "content": "BEI implemented a temporary trading suspension (trading halt) for 30 minutes towards the end of session 1 today, Tuesday (18/3), after the IHSG plunged more than -5%. This marks the first time BEI implemented a trading halt since late 2020. After trading resumed, the IHSG briefly sank to -7.1% - marking the largest intraday decline since September 2011 - before selling pressure somewhat subsided and the index closed down -3.84%. Based on their weighting, the 5 stocks that most pressured the IHSG movement today were DCII (-20%), TPIA (-18.42%), BREN (-11.79%), BBRI (-3.92%), and BBCA (-3.49%). The sudden fall of the IHSG today surprised market participants, considering stock exchanges in Asian countries were uniformly strengthening. The IHSG plunge today can be linked to several factors and negative sentiments that have emerged recently, such as: Speculation of Sri Mulyani's Resignation - In recent days, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani has been rumored to be dismissed in an imminent cabinet reshuffle and/or resign from her post. After initially being reluctant to comment regarding this issue, Sri Mulyani finally affirmed this afternoon that she is not resigning from her position. Meanwhile, Gerindra Party Daily Chairman, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, stated on Monday (17/3) that President Prabowo Subianto has no plans to conduct a cabinet reshuffle in the near future, including for the finance minister position. Fiscal Deficit Earlier Than Expected - Last week, the market was surprised by an earlier State Budget deficit in 2025, with the realized deficit for 2M25 reaching 31.2 trillion rupiah or 0.13% of GDP. This is the first time the State Budget recorded a deficit in the first two months of the year since 2021, according to Bloomberg reports. This result was pressured by a -20.8% YoY drop in state revenue, with tax receipts plunging -39.9% YoY. This afternoon, Sri Mulyani stated that gross tax receipts during March 1-17, 2025, grew +6.6% YoY. Concerns about the widening fiscal deficit from the target of 2.53% of GDP also became an investor focus amidst various programs launched by the government. Concerns about Economic Growth - The drop in tax receipts could indicate a weakening Indonesian economy, according to the Chairman of the Indonesian Shopping Center Management Association DPD Jakarta, Mualim Wijoyo. In February 2025, Indonesia experienced a deflation of 0.09% YoY, marking the first annual deflation since March 2000. Early this year, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut the BI Rate by -25 bps to the level of 5.75%, with the consideration to boost economic growth. Bank Indonesia itself cut its 2025 Indonesian economic growth outlook from the range of +4.8-5.6% YoY to +4.7-5.5% YoY along with weakening consumption, employment, investment, and exports. Forced Liquidation of Margin Traders and Sluggish Inflow Ahead of Holidays - According to fund manager at SGMC Capital Pte., Mohit Mirpuri, the sudden IHSG plunge today was also triggered by a wave of forced liquidations, especially among margin traders. Mirpuri also explained that sentiment toward the IHSG is currently still weak, and there is no new inflow to support the index ahead of the long Eid holidays from March 28 to April 7, 2025. With today's weakening, the IHSG has weakened -12.1% YTD, pressured by foreign outflows of approximately 29.5 trillion rupiah. Key Takeaway With the above concerns, the following factors need attention from investors: The announcement of the BI Rate interest rate tomorrow, Wednesday (19/3). Although an interest rate cut decision may be taken to support economic growth, it could put pressure on the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar. The execution of various government programs to boost economic growth and increase investor confidence. Investors can utilize this market correction to accumulate, considering the IHSG valuation is currently at an attractive level of 10.5x 1-Year Forward P/E, approaching -3 Standard Deviations of the last 10 years and nearly equivalent to valuations during the Covid-19 pandemic. The following issuers are considered to have good quality, so they can be considered by investors: BBCA: consistent growth track record and good risk management. ASII: resilient performance from diversified businesses and a relatively high dividend prospect (~8%). TSPC: defensive, holds much cash in US dollars and a relatively high dividend prospect (~8%). Investors can also manage market volatility risk by considering FR bond products and retail SBN: PBS032 offers a yield of ~6.23% per year with a tenor of ~1 year. ST014 (floating with floor) can be purchased on Bibit until April 16, 2025: ST014-T2: minimum yield of 6.5% per year, due April 10, 2027. ST014-T4: minimum yield of 6.6% per year, due April 10, 2029.",

Previously, RAJA President Director, Djauhar Maulidi, stated that the acquisition plan for this company was targeted to be completed in 1H25. Additionally, RAJA is also open to the option of acquiring offshore oil and gas infrastructure companies - such as oil tanker companies or other processing facilities - and has completed a joint feasibility study with a partner to build an LNG terminal in Cilegon, Banten. This acquisition is carried out to optimize the company's Debt-to-EBITDA position, which is currently low (1.54x) and will decrease again due to equity increase from the divestment of a 10% stake in RATU worth 319 billion rupiah. Beyond acquisitions, RAJA allocates capex of around 70-100 million US dollars in 2025 (vs. 2024: 14 million US dollars) for the gradual completion of new projects.",

      "content": "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut the global economic growth projection to +3.1% YoY in 2025 and +3% YoY in 2026, which is -0.2 and -0.3 percentage points lower than the previous estimates, respectively. The projection cut was based on trade barriers and increasing geopolitical uncertainty burdening investment and household spending. OECD also lowered Indonesia's economic growth projection to +4.9% YoY in 2025 and +5% YoY in 2026, which is -0.3 and -0.1 percentage points lower than the previous projections. For 2025 alone, the Indonesian government targets economic growth of +5.2% YoY. Secretary General of the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association, Meidy Katrin Lengkey, stated on Monday (17/3) that the government's plan to increase royalty tariffs for minerals and coal (minerba) could potentially cause nickel mines to shut down. Meidy stated that APNI conducted a survey and found that a royalty tariff discourse of 14% would cause several miners to incur losses in the production process. Meidy added that Indonesia's current nickel royalty tariff of 10% is among the highest compared to other nickel-producing countries, such as Russia (maximum 8%), Australia (2.5-5%), China (2-10%), Vietnam (10%), Philippines (5-9%), Brazil (2%), South Africa (0.5-7%), and Canada (5-10%). State Secretary Minister, Prasetyo Hadi, stated on Monday (17/3) that the appointment of civil servant candidates (CPNS) will be carried out no later than June 2025, while all government employees with work agreements (PPPK) will be appointed no later than October 2025. Prasetyo's statement came only about a week after the government and DPR agreed to postpone the appointment of 2024 CPNS selections to October 1, 2025, with PPPK appointments on March 1, 2026. The US Department of Commerce noted that US retail sales grew +0.2% MoM in February 2025 (vs. Jan 2025: -1.2% MoM), lower than the consensus expectation of +0.6% MoM. Annually, US retail sales grew +3.1% YoY in February 2025 (vs. Jan 2025: 3.9% YoY). China's national statistics bureau noted that retail sales in China grew +4% YoY during 2M25 (vs. Dec 2024: +3.7% YoY), in line with consensus expectations. Household consumption in 2M25 was boosted by holiday spending during the Lunar New Year. BPS noted that Indonesia's crude and processed palm oil exports in February 2025 reached 2.06 million metric tons (+62.2% MoM, +45.1% YoY), marking the highest level in the last 4 months. This result was driven by the government's move to lower export tariffs since September 2024, which made buyers switch from Malaysia. Director of the Palm Oil Plantation Fund Management Agency, Kabul Wijayanto, stated on Tuesday (18/3) that the Indonesian government plans to raise the CPO export levy from the range of 3-7.5% to 4.5-10% of the CPO reference price. This measure is intended to finance the B40 mandatory biodiesel program. Kabul explained that the government will apply the new tariff 3 days after the regulation is released, which is currently still in process. The shareholder of Graha Prima Mentari (GRPM), PT Prima Multi Usaha Indonesia, purchased approximately 1.08 billion GRPM shares from Agus Susanto and Rudy Susanto Wijaya at a price of 120 rupiah per share on March 14, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 130 billion rupiah. Following this transaction, PT Prima Multi Usaha Indonesia's ownership in GRPM increased from 0.55% to 70.67%.",
