      "title": "World Bank Outlook and Global Economic Updates",
      "content": "World Bank Outlook Indonesia: In its October 2024 outlook, the World Bank raised its projection for Indonesia’s GDP growth to 5.0% YoY for 2024 and 5.1% YoY for 2025, each 0.1 percentage point higher than the April 2024 outlook. The Bank notes that Indonesia will benefit from higher household consumption, investment and government spending. World Bank East Asia and Pacific Chief Economist Aaditya Mattoo said that among major East-Asia-Pacific economies, only Indonesia is expected to grow in 2024 and 2025 at a rate equal to or above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWorld Bank Outlook China: The same October outlook increased China’s 2024 growth projection to 4.8% YoY, 0.3 percentage points above the April outlook, supported by a recovery in services consumption and exports early 2024. China’s 2025 growth is projected at 4.3% YoY, unchanged from April, with lower growth attributed to a persistent property market weakness, weak consumer and investor confidence, and structural challenges such as ageing population and global tensions.\n\nChina Fiscal Briefing: The Chinese government announced that Finance Minister Lan Fo’an will hold a briefing on fiscal policy on Saturday 12 Oct at 10:00 local time, amid a weakening rally after the National Development and Reform Commission announced a weaker-than-expected stimulus.\n\nChina Stimulus: On Tuesday 8 Oct, the National Development and Reform Commission announced a fiscal stimulus of 200 billion yuan for 2025, far below analyst consensus of a 3-trillion-yuan package.\n\nIndonesia Political Team: Kontan reported that the economic team in Prabowo Subianto’s cabinet will not differ much from President Joko Widodo’s cabinet, with incumbent ministers such as Sri Mulyani, Erick Thohir and Bahlil Lahadalia retained. Earlier, campaign adviser Drajad Wibowo told the Australian Financial Review in February 2024 that Sri Mulyani was unlikely to join the next administration, noting differing views with Prabowo on development policy.\n\nPrabowo Tax Cut: Gerindra Party Deputy Chairman and Prabowo’s brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo said Prabowo plans to cut the corporate income tax rate from 22% to 20% to boost Indonesia’s investment attractiveness, stimulate businesses, improve tax compliance and support corporate sector growth.\n\nGaikindo Sales: Gaikindo reported that domestic vehicle wholesale sales in September 2024 were 72,667 units, down 9.1% YoY and 4.8% MoM. Although still negative, the YoY decline was better than the 9M24 decline to 633,218 units, down 16.2% YoY, which represented 57.6% of the 2024 target of 1.1 million units. Gaikindo has previously announced a possible revision of the 2024 new-vehicle wholesale target to 1.1 million units.\n\nBank Indonesia Retail Forecast: Bank Indonesia estimated retail sales to grow 4.7% YoY but contract 2.5% MoM in September 2024, due to reduced consumer demand after the end of discount programs for the Republic of Indonesia’s Independence Day celebrations. Retail sales in August 2024 grew 1.7% MoM and 5.8% YoY.\n\nOil World Biodiesel: Senior analyst David Mielke at Reuters estimated that Indonesia’s plan to raise the CPO blend in biodiesel from 35% to 40% will tighten global CPO supplies. The increase would raise domestic CPO usage in biodiesel from 11 million tons to 13.9 million tons. Glenauk Economics’ Managing Director Julian McGill expects CPO to trade around Rp4,000 per ton in 2025.",

      "title": "LEAD Converts $20 Million Debt at Rp186 per Share",
      "content": "Logindo Samudramakmur (LEAD) plans a private placement of 1.75 billion new shares at an execution price of Rp186 per share to convert debt of US$20 million. The corporate action aims to improve the company's financial structure and will dilute existing shareholders by 30.17%. PT Jalan Terang Samudra, OCP Asia Fund IV (SF1) Pte. Ltd., and OCP Asia Fund V (SF1) Pte. Ltd. will take part in the new shares, with post-transaction ownership of 23.19%, 2.59% and 4.39% respectively. Previously they held no shares in LEAD. The plan will be discussed at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on 14 November 2024. Based on the 1H24 balance sheet, the conversion will reduce total debt from US$94.6 million to US$74.6 million, while equity will increase from US$23.5 million to US$43.5 million. With cash of US$7.6 million, the Net Debt-to-Equity ratio will fall from 3.69x to 1.54x. Key Takeaway: We view this corporate action as positive sentiment for LEAD given the high execution price and the prospect of improved financial structure. In the past two years LEAD has not recorded positive net profit due to high interest expenses, although the offshore supply vessel (OSV) sector has recovered and the company posted revenue growth. Assuming the converted debt carries a blended interest rate similar to 1H24, LEAD could reduce financial expense by approximately US$1.7 million per year, potentially allowing net profit of US$1.25 million for FY24 annualized. Using an exchange rate of Rp15,900 per US$, this net profit translates to EPS of Rp3.46 per share based on post-transaction share count. With the new share count, LEAD could trade at a FY24 annualized P/E of 33.8x. Following the announcement, LEAD shares jumped 26.5% to Rp148 per share on Wednesday (9 Oct).",
