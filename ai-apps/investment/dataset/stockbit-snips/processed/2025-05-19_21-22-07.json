      "content": "Moody's Ratings (Moody's) on Friday (16/5) downgraded the US government credit rating from Aaa with a negative outlook to Aa1 with a stable outlook, ending the country's perfect rating from Moody's since 1917. Moody's stated that this rating downgrade was due to increasing US debt and higher interest rates compared to other countries with the same rating. Previously, 2 other agencies - Fitch (2023) and Standard & Poor's (2011) - had downgraded US debt ratings. The national statistics bureau of China recorded on its website that China's industrial production grew +6.1% YoY in April 2025 (vs. Mar 2025: +7.7% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of +5.5% YoY. In separate data, China's retail sales grew +5.1% YoY in April 2025 (vs. Mar 2025: +5.9% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation of +5.5% YoY due to weak domestic consumption amid economic uncertainty. On the other hand, the unemployment rate in China slightly decreased to 5.1% in April 2025 (vs. Mar 2025: 5.2%), better than the consensus expectation of 5.2% and marking the lowest level since December 2024. The Rupiah exchange rate is projected to strengthen in the second half of 2025 along with expectations of more prudent fiscal management and a weaker outlook for the US currency. TD Securities predicts the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar will strengthen by more than 4% compared to the closing on Friday (16/5) at 16,440 in 4Q25. Meanwhile, Citigroup Global Markets expects the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar to strengthen to around 16,000 next year. The Ministry of Communication and Digital issued regulations restricting shipping fee promotions or discounts on e-commerce delivery services. The regulation is stipulated in Minister of Communication and Information Regulation No. 8/2025, which stipulates that price reductions resulting in commercial postal service rates falling below the cost of services can only be applied for a certain period, a maximum of only 3 days in 1 month. The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (GAPKI) on Friday (16/5) urged the government to delay the planned increase in CPO export levies as it could damage competitiveness amid global trade uncertainty due to US tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Reuters reported that GAPKI's request will be discussed in a meeting with the government this week. The Ministry of Finance and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs have not commented on this issue. The Minister of Trade, Budi Santoso, said on Sunday (18/5) that the revision of Trade Minister Regulation No. 8/2024 concerning import policies and regulation is expected to be completed this week. Although he could not elaborate further on the substance of the regulation, Budi claimed that the rule change would not cause Indonesia to be flooded with imported products, especially for commodities related to labor-intensive industries, strategic industries, and food security. The Minister of Agriculture Amran Sulaiman said that the government will prepare a budget of 5 trillion rupiah to absorb 1 million tons of farmer maize during 2025. This budget allocation was decided following an increase in the government purchase price (HPP) at the farmer level to 5,500 rupiah per kilogram from the previous 5,000 rupiah per kilogram. Amran added that national maize production surged +39% YoY during 1Q25, the highest growth in history. The Banten Regional Police's Directorate of General Criminal Investigation on Friday (16/5) named the Chairman of Kadin Cilegon Muhammad Salim, the Deputy Chairman of Kadin for Cilegon Industry Ismatullah, and the Chairman of the All Indonesian Fishermen Association Rufaji Jahuri as suspects in extortion and threats. The designation of suspects followed a viral video showing a number of mass organization members and people in white uniforms with the writing Kadin Cilegon demanding project shares without auction from representatives of the Chinese contractor company, Chengda Engineering Co. Ltd., which is building the factory for Chandra Asri Pacific entity, PT Chandra Asri Alkali. The Chairman of the Indonesian Transportation Workers Union (SPAI), Lily Pujiati, said on Monday (19/5) that thousands of online motorcycle taxi drivers, online taxi drivers, and couriers will hold simultaneous demonstration actions and off bid (shutting down applications) on Tuesday (20/5). Lily stated that this action is being carried out nationally as a form of protest against working conditions deemed unfair.",

      "title": "BBCA Bank Only 4M25: Net Profit +17% YoY, Driven by Dividend Income (excluding subsidiary dividends, 4M25 Net Profit grew +9.6% YoY)",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia ($BBCA) recorded net profit (bank only) of 4.5 trillion rupiah in April 2025 (-8.2% YoY, -33% MoM). This result led the bank-only net profit for 4M25 to grow +17% YoY to 20.2 trillion rupiah. If dividends from subsidiaries are excluded, BBCA's bank-only net profit grew +9.6% YoY in 4M25, slightly above the 2025F estimate from consensus at +6.3% YoY. The growth in net profit was supported by: 1) dividend receipts from subsidiaries; 2) a solid increase in Net Interest Income (NII) along with a highly recorded CASA Ratio; and 3) declining provision expenses. Dividend Receipts from Subsidiaries Net profit growth for BBCA during 4M25 was supported by dividend receipts from subsidiaries amounting to 2.2 trillion rupiah in March 2025. This result caused Non-Interest Income (Non-II) to grow +26% YoY during 4M25. Although dividends from subsidiaries are recorded as a Non-II account in the bank-only financial statements, these receipts will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Excluding these dividend receipts, BBCA's Non-II and net profit during 4M25 grew by only +9% YoY and +9.6% YoY, respectively. CASA Ratio Recorded High, NIM in Line with Guidance BBCA's bank-only NIM slightly increased to 5.7% during 4M25 (vs. 4M24: 5.6%), in line with management's consolidated 2025 guidance targeting a range of 5.7-5.8%. This result is reflected in NII which grew to 26.3 trillion rupiah during 4M25 (+6.6% YoY). NII growth can be attributed to solid CASA growth during 4M25 (+6% YoY) relative to Time Deposits (-2.7% YoY), causing the CASA Ratio to rise to 82.9% (vs. 4M24: 81.6%, 3M25: 82.9%). From the loan yield side, BBCA management stated in the 1Q25 earnings call that there is room for loan repricing following the slowdown in credit growth. During 4M25, total credit growth moderated to +12.8% YoY (+16.5% YoY in 4M24, +12.3% YoY in 3M25), moving towards management's consolidated 2025 guidance in the range of +6-8% YoY. Despite this, BBCA's bank-only Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) broke the 80% level again after slightly dropping in 3M25 (80.4%, vs. 78.1% in 3M25, 80.6% in 2M25). We are not overly concerned about this LDR increase as it is primarily caused by the decrease in Time Deposits. Furthermore, BBCA's LDR is still considered 'ample' compared to other Big 4 Banks. Provision Expenses Declined, CoC Still Higher than Guidance BBCA recorded a bank-only Cost of Cover (CoC) at 0.59% in April 2025 (vs. March 2025: 0.29%, April 2024: 0.94%). This result led the CoC during 4M25 to drop to 0.42% (vs. 4M24: 0.53%), worse than management's 2025 guidance targeting 0.3%. Provision expenses decreased year-on-year in April 2025 (-30% YoY) and during 4M25 (-8.7% YoY) due to the high-base effect. Key Takeaway We assess BBCA's 4M25 performance as mixed. Positively, NIM is maintained and in line with guidance amidst tight banking liquidity. In the 1Q25 earnings call, management revealed that BBCA sees room for loan repricing. However, the CoC being higher than guidance is a concern for us.",
