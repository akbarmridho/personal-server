Although he did not explain them in detail, Dony mentioned that these work programs include restructuring, consolidation, and business development for SOEs, consisting of:1. Restructuring in 4 sectors, namely airline business, steel manufacturing, high-speed rail, and insurance.2. Business consolidation in 9 sectors, namely construction business, fertilizer, hospital, hotel, sugar, oil downstreaming, insurance, asset management, and industrial estates.3. Business development will target the cooperative business sector, food, batteries, cement, sharia banking, telecommunications, and the shipbuilding industry.Regarding the consolidation plan for State-Owned Construction Companies (BUMN Karya), Dony stated that his party will consolidate subsidiaries that are not directly related to the core business. The consolidation plan for State-Owned Construction Companies is not new, considering this discourse has emerged since 2023.Meanwhile, Member of Commission VI of the DPR, Ahmad Labib, reminded Danantara to avoid the conglomerate model in implementing SOE consolidation and transformation programs. Ahmad stated that the conglomerate model previously applied by SOEs was unproductive and often became a source of inefficiency in the past.Kontan reported that Danantara and Commission XI of the DPR also held a closed meeting on Wednesday (7/23). The Chairman of Commission XI of the DPR, Mukhamad Misbakhun, explained that the meeting was held in a closed session because several matters conveyed by Danantara were feared to affect the market, given that the information was insider in nature.",
