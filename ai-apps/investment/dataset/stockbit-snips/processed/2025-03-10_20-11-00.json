      "title": "Government Plans to Amend Minerba Royalty Rates",
      "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on Saturday (8/3) held a public consultation regarding the draft amendment to mineral and coal (minerba) royalties. In the draft (see table), the government will increase the royalty rate for several mineral commodities, such as nickel, copper, and gold. Meanwhile, for coal commodities, the government plans to adjust the royalty rate and non-tax state revenue (PNBP) as follows:\n- IUP Contracts: Royalty rate increases by +1 percentage point for coal with calorific value ≤4,200 and >4,200-5,200 when the Reference Coal Price (HBA) ≥90 US dollars per ton, becoming 9% and 11.5% respectively.\n- PKP2B Contracts: Royalty rate increases by +1 percentage point for coal with calorific value ≤4,200 and >4,200-5,200 when the Reference Coal Price (HBA) ≥90 US dollars per ton, becoming 9% and 11.5% respectively. Furthermore, Mining Revenue Share (PHT) for the same calorific value and HBA decreases by -1 percentage point, becoming 4.5% and 2% respectively.\n- IUPK Contracts (extension from PKP2B): The royalty rate range is changed. The government also plans to adjust the corporate income tax (PPh) rate for companies with IUPK contracts from 22% to align with corporate income tax regulations.\n\nKey Takeaway\nIf ratified, we assess this proposal has the potential to suppress the performance of coal producer issuers operating under IUP permits such as Bukit Asam ($PTBA) and PKP2B such as Indo Tambangraya Megah ($ITMG). Additionally, the increase in royalty rates for metal commodities also has the potential to suppress the performance of mineral producer issuers, such as Vale Indonesia ($INCO), Trimegah Bangun Persada ($NCKL), Aneka Tambang ($ANTM), Bumi Resources Minerals ($BRMS), and Amman Mineral Internasional ($AMMN).\nBased on the adjustment plan above, the commodities that will experience the highest royalty increase are copper ore and ferronickel. With a Reference Mineral Price (HMA) for copper of 9,362 US dollars per ton in March 2025, the royalty for copper ore has the potential to triple from 5% to 15%, while the royalty for ferronickel increases by +150% from 2% to 5%.\nMeanwhile, for coal producers operating under IUPK contracts, we assess that the discourse on adjusting the PNBP rate range has the potential to boost the related issuer's performance, considering the HBA as of March 2025 is 128 US dollars per ton. Coal producer issuers operating under IUPK contracts are Bumi Resources ($BUMI), Indika Energy ($INDY), and Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI).\n\n*This article was released in Stockbit Commentary on Monday (10/3) morning.",
