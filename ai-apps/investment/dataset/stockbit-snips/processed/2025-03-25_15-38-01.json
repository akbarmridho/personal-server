The Director of Monetary Management and Securities Assets at Bank Indonesia, Fitra Jusdiman, told Reuters that the central bank would intervene to maintain the stability of the rupiah exchange rate. Jusdiman attributed the rupiah weakening to global uncertainty, including tariffs planned by US President Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve's potentially more hawkish policy.",

      "title": "TSPC Records Solid Net Profit in 4Q24 Driven by Exchange Rate Gains; FY24 Core Profit +48% YoY",
      "content": "Tempo Scan Pacific (TSPC) recorded a solid net profit in 4Q24 of 365 billion rupiah (+62% YoY, +40% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 2024 to 1.45 trillion rupiah (+23% YoY), in line with our expectations (100% of Stockbit's 2024F estimate). The net profit in 4Q24 was mainly driven by exchange rate gains, reflected in other income of 121 billion rupiah (vs. 4Q23: loss of 81 billion rupiah, 3Q24: loss of 161 billion rupiah). This reversal from exchange rate losses to gains aligns with what we previously wrote in the Stockbit Commentary, caused by the strengthening of the US dollar against the rupiah in 4Q24. For information, TSPC had net assets in foreign currency of ~128 million US dollars as of the end of December 2024. Excluding exchange rate gains/losses and non-recurring income/expenses, core profit in 4Q24 tended to be weak at 244 billion rupiah (-20% YoY, -42% QoQ). Nevertheless, core profit throughout 2024 still grew rapidly to 1.34 trillion rupiah (+48% YoY), in line with our expectations (99% of Stockbit's 2024F estimate). The relatively weak core profit in 4Q24 was primarily due to a surge in opex, especially in employee salaries and compensation. Sales expenses in 4Q24 increased to 886 billion rupiah (+10% YoY, +34% QoQ), although advertising and promotion expenses decreased annually to 465 billion rupiah (-12% YoY, +22% QoQ). Meanwhile, general and administrative expenses also increased to 204 billion rupiah (+33% YoY, +25% QoQ), resulting in total opex rising to 1.09 trillion rupiah (+14% YoY, +32% QoQ). We suspect the jump in salary and compensation expenses in 4Q24 is related to bonuses paid for the company's excellent performance throughout 2024. In terms of business, TSPC booked solid sales. Although total revenue in 4Q24 only reached 3.5 trillion rupiah (+4% YoY, +4% QoQ), this result was mainly due to weakness in the 'Distribution' segment (-7% YoY). The company's two most important segments - 'Pharmaceuticals' and 'Consumer and Cosmetics' - performed solidly in 4Q24, growing by +10% YoY and +11% YoY, respectively. With these results, the 'Pharmaceuticals' and 'Consumer and Cosmetics' segments grew by +17% YoY and +11% YoY throughout 2024, respectively, in line with our thesis in Unboxing TSPC. Key Takeaway: Although core profit in 4Q24 tended to be weak, this was primarily due to a surge in opex related to salaries and compensation expenses. If our assumption is correct, the high opex in 4Q24 will not recur and will normalize going forward, especially with expectations of more moderate yet still solid profit growth. Currently, we project TSPC's core profit growth in 2025 will be +15% YoY. We believe TSPC's growth prospects will remain solid, primarily driven by the ongoing downtrading trend amidst poor purchasing power conditions. Additionally, TSPC offers attractive dividend potential. With an expected dividend payout ratio of 55%, the potential final dividend for the 2024 fiscal year reached 152 rupiah per share, indicating a yield of ~6.5% based on the share price of 2,340 rupiah per share at the market close on Tuesday (25/3). In terms of valuation, TSPC is currently trading at 6.8x 2025 P/E, a level considered attractive by us for a company with the offered growth prospects.",

This result brought the bank-only net profit over 2M25 to 3.3 trillion rupiah (+8.3% YoY), relatively in line with the 2025 consolidated growth estimate from the consensus (+8.8% YoY). Net profit growth was mainly supported by a decrease in the bank-only cost of credit (CoC) to 0.77% during 2M25 (vs. 2M24: 1.06%), marking the lowest level since at least 1M22 and better than management's 2025 bank-only guidance of ±1%.

Meanwhile, credit growth slowed to +10.2% YoY during 2M25 (vs. 1M25: +10.3% YoY, 12M24: +10.7% YoY), consistent with management's intention to target 2025 consolidated growth in the range of +8-10% YoY, while the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio reached 95.7% (vs. 2M24: 87.8%, 1M25: 96.8%).",
