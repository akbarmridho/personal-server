      "title": "Indonesia Coal Export Decline Pressed by Weak China Demand",
      "content": "Commodity analysis firm Kpler reported that thermal coal exports from Indonesia fell by 20 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes during the first four months of 2025, a 12 percent year-on-year decline, marking the lowest export volume in the last three years and the worst annual percentage drop since early 2017. The export decline in the first four months of 2025 was driven by weakening demand from China and India, both of which are experiencing increases in domestic coal production. Exports to China fell by 14 million tonnes, equivalent to a 20 percent year-on-year decrease, while exports to India fell by 6 million tonnes, equivalent to a 15 percent year-on-year decrease. Data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) shows an even lower figure, with Indonesian coal exports since the start of the new year reaching about 131 million tonnes as of 16 May 2025. This amount meets only about 26.2 percent of the 2025 export target of roughly 500 million tonnes. For context, the ministry recorded that Indonesian coal exports in 2024 reached about 441 million tonnes, fulfilling only about 90 percent of the 2024 target of 490 million tonnes. The decline in Indonesian coal exports also occurred amid falling demand for coal-fired electricity. Think-tank Ember noted that coal-fired power generation across Asia fell by 3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025 as the region shifts toward clean energy and China’s industrial activity weakens. The shrinking export volume is likely pressured by reduced sales volumes of several coal issuers in the first quarter of 2025, such as United Tractors (UNTR), Bumi Resources (BUMI), and Harum Energy (HRUM). Nevertheless, some issuers – including Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI), Bukit Asam (PTBA), and Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITMG) – still recorded year-on-year increases in export and sales volumes. On the supply side, the ESDM ministry recorded that Indonesian coal production in the first quarter of 2025 reached only 171 million tonnes, a 16.1 percent year-on-year decline, meeting only about 23.1 percent of the 2025 target of roughly 740 million tonnes. According to a presentation by ITMG management on the 1Q25 earnings call, coal demand in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to fall by 71 million metric tonnes in 2025, mainly due to weakness in China. At the same time, coal supply in the Asia-Pacific is projected to drop by 27 million metric tonnes in 2025 as Indonesian production declines. Key Takeaway: We see that national coal production and export may miss the 2025 targets when looking at data from the start of the year. This aligns with the risk that several issuers will not meet their production targets due to weak output in 1Q25. We predict coal prices could trade flat in the range of US$90-100 per tonne throughout 2025, assuming: 1) weak industrial activity in Asia – especially India and China – amid U.S. tariff policies; and 2) high coal inventories in China.",

      "content": "1. A Bloomberg survey shows analysts and investors expect the United States to keep a 30 percent tariff on China until the end of 2025. Although lower than previous levels, a 30 percent tariff could eliminate 70 percent of Chinese exports to the U.S. in the medium term, according to Bloomberg Economics. 2. Bloomberg reported that since the beginning of May 2025, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) has recorded a net foreign inflow of US$83.8 million as of 15 May 2025. If the trend continues, IHSG could end the seven-month net foreign outflow streak. Bloomberg says the inflow trend may indicate renewed foreign investor interest after confidence was eroded by concerns over slowing economic growth, fiscal policy, and global trade tensions. 3. Reuters reported that on 15 May 2025, SKK Migas approved Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC) to develop the Anambas block in the Natuna Sea. KUFPEC will invest about US$1.54 billion to develop the block to produce 55 million standard cubic feet of gas per year, with total gas sales projected at 185 billion cubic feet. KUFPEC aims for a final investment decision in early 2026, with production expected to start in 2028. 4. Malaysia and Indonesia plan to increase LNG import capacity, according to Takuya Tanabe, Head of Asian LNG Origination at JERA Global Markets. Tanabe said this could shift global LNG market dynamics, as Malaysia and Indonesia are the world’s fifth and sixth largest LNG exporters in 2024. Previously, Bloomberg reported in January 2025 that the Indonesian government asked domestic LNG exporters to postpone shipments this year due to rising domestic energy demand. 5. Bloomberg reported that Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) is in talks with BPI Danantara about a capital injection to improve the airline’s finances. The discussions are in early stages and details of the amount are still being negotiated. 6. Apexindo Pratama Duta (APEX) secured a contract worth US$25 million from PT Pertamina Hulu Mahakam for offshore drilling in the Delta Mahakam area of East Kalimantan for one year. 7. The controlling shareholder of PAM Mineral (NICL), Christopher Sumasto Tjia, bought approximately 1.3 million NICL shares at an average price of IDR 1,047 per share on 15 May 2025, a transaction valued at about IDR 1.3 billion. After the transaction, his direct ownership increased from 0.259 percent to 0.271 percent.",
