      "content": "Consumer price index inflation in the US in November 2024 rose to 2.7% YoY and 0.3% MoM (\r\nvs. October 2024: inflation 2.6% YoY and 0.2% MoM), moving away from The Fed's target of 2% inflation and marking the highest monthly inflation in 7 months. Nevertheless, annual and monthly inflation were both in line with consensus expectations.\r\n\r\nFollowing the inflation data release, the market became more optimistic about the prospect of a Fed interest rate cut at the December 2024 meeting, which will be held next week. Based on analysis from the CME Fedwatch Tool, the probability of a 25 bps US interest rate cut at the December 2024 meeting increased from 73.8% on Wednesday (4/12) to 98.6% as of Thursday (12/12). Meanwhile, the probability of a Fed interest rate cut of \tâ‰¥75 bps until June 2025 decreased from 53.5% on Wednesday (4/12) to 48.1% on Thursday (12/12).\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday (11/12), the movement of the US stock market tended to be mixed with Nasdaq rising +1.77%, S&P500 strengthening +0.82%, and DJIA correcting -0.22%. Meanwhile, the 10-year US government bond yield rose +4 bps to 4.27% and the US dollar index (DXY) rose +0.29% to 106.71.",
