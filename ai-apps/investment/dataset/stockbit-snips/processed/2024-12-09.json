      "title": "UNVR provides detailed follow-up on ice-cream business sale",
      "content": "On 25 November 2024, Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) announced a sale agreement for its ice-cream business valued at IDR 7 trillion (excluding VAT), which we previously covered in a Stockbit Commentary. UNVR has now released further details about the transaction. Key points: • Ice-cream business contributed 9.5% of 2023 revenue, with negative sales growth of -2% CAGR from 2019-2023; market share fell from 69.2% in 2019 to 61.9% in 9M24. The decline in ice-cream sales was slightly better than UNVR’s overall sales decline of -2.6% CAGR over the same period. Profitability of the ice-cream business fell from 11.1% in 2019 to 7.2% in 2023, roughly a mid-high single-digit level. The business generated approximately IDR 264 billion profit in 2023, implying a transaction valuation of 26.5x P/E. • Potential additional dividend with an implied yield of 5.3% – UNVR plans to distribute the net proceeds of the transaction as cash dividend after closing. Pro-forma financials show a profit of IDR 3.8 trillion (after tax) from the sale, which, if fully paid out, yields a dividend yield of 5.3% based on the closing price of IDR 1,870 per share on Friday 6 December. The exact closing date of the transaction has not been announced; the shareholders’ meeting for approval is scheduled for 14 January 2025. Key Takeaway: We view the ice-cream business sale as positive for UNVR. The divestiture allows the company to focus on its core operations, and the 26.5x P/E valuation is considered premium given the negative growth and lower profitability of the business. For comparison, Campina Ice Cream Industry (CAMP) trades at 21.4x P/E (TTM) as of today’s close, Monday 9 December. On the day of this article, UNVR shares closed up 1.34% at IDR 1,895 per share. *This article was first released as a Stockbit Commentary on Monday 9 December morning.*",
