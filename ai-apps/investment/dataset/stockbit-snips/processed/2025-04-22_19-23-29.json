      "title": "DXY Continues Weakness Amidst Rumors of Fed Chairman Dismissal",
      "content": "The US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped -1.8% WoW to the level of 98.36 today, Tuesday (22/4), after briefly falling to 97.93 on Monday (21/4), marking the lowest level since March 2022. Year-to-date, DXY has weakened by -9.3% YTD as of today. This weakening occurred as investors exited the US due to escalating trade wars and concerns about a US economic recession, exacerbated by concerns over the diminishing independence of the Fed following US President Donald Trump's plan to find ways to fire the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell, due to disagreements regarding US interest rate policy. In November 2024, Powell asserted that he would not step down until his term ends in May 2026. Powell also affirmed at that time that the possibility of Trump firing him was not permitted by regulations. Amidst the weakening DXY, gold prices continued their upward trend, reaching an all-time high of 3,499 US dollars per troy ounce in intraday trading on the spot market today. On Monday (21/4), gold prices in the spot market closed up +3.28% at 3,423 US dollars per troy ounce, soaring +28.8% YTD. Furthermore, investors appear to be redirecting their funds to other developed countries, reflected in the strengthening of the yen (+12.1% YTD), euro (+11% YTD), and pound sterling (+6.8% YTD). On the other hand, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar has weakened -4.7% YTD to the level of 16,855 as of today, although it slightly strengthened from its all-time low of 16,957 on April 9, 2025. The depreciation of the rupiah since the beginning of the year makes it one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies amid DXY weakness. This happened particularly due to the vulnerability of investor confidence in Indonesia. According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday (22/4), MUFG Bank Ltd. predicts the rupiah will continue to weaken against the US dollar to the level of 17,100 in the coming months, while Barclays Bank plc projects the rupiah will reach 17,200 in 1Q26 assuming intervention from Bank Indonesia. Key Takeaway: The shift of investors to gold is predicted to continue. In mid-April 2025, Goldman Sachs raised its gold price outlook for the end of 2025 to 3,700 US dollars per troy ounce, driven by increasing concerns over the US economy amidst the escalation of the trade war with China. Regarding the rupiah itself, continued pressure on the exchange rate against the US dollar may limit Bank Indonesia's room to cut interest rates. According to a Reuters report on Tuesday (22/4), the consensus among economists expects Bank Indonesia to hold the BI Rate at 5.75% in the Board of Governors Meeting on Wednesday (23/4) due to exchange rate depreciation concerns outweighing concerns about slowing economic growth. Economists surveyed by Reuters expect Bank Indonesia to lower the BI Rate by 25 bps to 5.5% in 2Q25, before cutting another 25 bps in 3Q25 to 5.25% and holding that level until the end of 2025.",

      "content": "China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, stated on Monday (21/4) that China is willing to import more products from Indonesia, describing the two countries as \"global defenders of economic globalization and free trade.\" Responding to this, Foreign Minister Sugiono said on Monday (21/4) that the partnership with China and the US is equally important for Indonesia. China Customs recorded that coal imports from Indonesia fell -9% YoY in March 2025 to ~18 million tons. This result led to China's coal imports from Indonesia during 1Q25 growing +1% YoY to ~52.6 million tons. The decline in coal imports from Indonesia in March 2025 occurred after the Indonesian government mandated the Reference Coal Price (HBA) as a reference for Indonesian coal export prices as of March 1, 2025, although the government had provided relaxation to exporters to still be able to use the Indonesian Coal Index (ICI) as a reference selling price for existing contracts. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has issued Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No.10/2025 concerning the energy transition roadmap for the electricity sector, which prohibits the development of new Coal-Fired Power Plants (PLTU) and limits the operation of existing PLTUs until 2050 at the latest. EVP of New and Renewable Energy at PLN, Zainal Arifin, stated on Monday (21/4) that the new and renewable energy sources that will replace PLTUs are nuclear power plants (PLTN) and geothermal power plants (PLTP). The U.S. Trade Representative office raised concerns about customs practices in Indonesia as a non-tariff barrier, including the use of reference values that contradict international standards, inconsistent customs duty assessment, and the risk of abuse of authority from the customs officer reward system in Indonesia. Responding to this issue, the Executive Director of the Center of Economics and Law Studies, Bhima Yudhistira, told Kontan that the criticism from the U.S. Trade Representative office has long been complained about by foreign and domestic companies in Indonesia, so it should serve as an alarm for the government to reform the customs system. Kontan reported that the price of live chicken plummeted sharply in the weeks following Eid al-Fitr 2025 to the range of 11,500-12,000 rupiah per kg, far below the purchase reference price (HAP) set by Bapanas at 21,000-23,000 rupiah per kg. The Deputy Secretary-General of the People's Poultry Industry Association, Samhadi, said that the price decrease was mainly caused by oversupply, especially due to low absorption from the Free Nutritious Meal program and pressure on community purchasing power even during the Eid momentum. The Chairman of the Commercial Affairs for the Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI), Sigit Kumala, said on Monday (21/4) that they are considering cutting the domestic motorcycle sales target for 2025, although he did not elaborate further. During 1Q25, domestic motorcycle sales fell -3% YoY to ~1.7 million units, equivalent to 25-27% of the 2025 target set by AISI at 6.4-6.7 million units. Sigit explained that the decline in motorcycle sales in 1Q25 was suppressed by weakening public purchasing power and increasingly selective financing institutions in providing credit. Sigit also does not see any impetus that could boost motorcycle sales for the remainder of the year, especially amid economic uncertainty, weakening purchasing power, and the weakening of the rupiah exchange rate.",
