      "content": "Gaikindo reported that national automobile wholesales in February 2025 reached 72,295 units, a 2.2 percent year‑on‑year increase and a 17 percent month‑on‑month rise, marking the first annual growth since June 2023. The result brings total 2‑month (January‑February) 2025 wholesales to 134,144 units, down 4.5 percent year‑on‑year, representing 15‑18 percent of Gaikindo's 2025 target of 750,000‑900,000 units (compared with 2‑month 2024, which was 16.2 percent of the 2024 realization). Highlights: 1) ASII relative weakness – market share fell. Combined, the two main Astra International brands, Toyota and Daihatsu, recorded a 5.8 percent year‑on‑year decline and a 13 percent month‑on‑month increase in February 2025, performing worse than the industry average of +2.2 percent year‑on‑year and +17 percent month‑on‑month. Their combined market share dropped to 50.3 percent in February 2025 (versus 54.6 percent in February 2024 and 51.8 percent in January 2025). Over the first two months of 2025, Toyota and Daihatsu wholesales totaled 68,421 units, down 7.5 percent year‑on‑year, also weaker than the industry decline of 4.5 percent year‑on‑year, resulting in a combined market share of 51 percent (versus 52.6 percent in 2‑month 2024 and 51.8 percent in January 2025). 2) Main competitors outperformed ASII. Among the top three competitors, Mitsubishi posted the strongest performance with 8,790 units sold in February 2025, up 6.6 percent year‑on‑year and 23 percent month‑on‑month, raising its market share to 12.2 percent (versus 11.6 percent in February 2024 and 11.5 percent in January 2025). Suzuki recorded a decline to 4,750 units, down 4.9 percent year‑on‑year and 4.7 percent month‑on‑month, but its decline was still milder than Toyota and Daihatsu. 3) Chinese brands surged. Wuling and Chery posted sales jumps of +61 percent year‑on‑year and +241 percent year‑on‑year respectively in February 2025. Chery sold 1,468 units, the highest since the brand entered Indonesia, driven by the launch of the Tiggo Cross at the Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) 2025. BYD sold 1,399 units, remaining relatively stable compared with the average of the previous two months.",

IIMS 2025 was considered successful, recording a 16 percent year‑on‑year increase in sales to 22,322 units. In our view, the success of IIMS 2025 indicates that consumers responded positively to the new models launched, supporting a recovery of national automobile sales this year.",
