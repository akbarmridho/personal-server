This result brought the net profit for 2024 to 1.5 trillion rupiah (+22% YoY), in line with expectations as it equates to 102% of consensus estimates. Net profit in 4Q24 was supported by revenue growth (+18% YoY, +8% QoQ) and gross profit margin expansion to 46% (+370 bps YoY, +50 bps QoQ) following the decrease in raw material costs (-23% YoY, -27% QoQ). Nevertheless, operating profit in 4Q24 only grew slightly year-on-year (+1% YoY, -40% QoQ) due to an increase in operating expenses (+43% YoY, +55% QoQ), mainly an increase in marketing expenses (+70% YoY, +104% QoQ). Net profit growth in 4Q24 was also supported by financial income of 86 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (vs 4Q23: 38 billion rupiah) and foreign exchange gains of 65 billion rupiah (vs 4Q23: loss of 5 billion rupiah).",
