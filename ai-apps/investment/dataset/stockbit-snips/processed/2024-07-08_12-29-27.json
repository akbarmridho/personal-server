Here are the details: Non-farm payrolls [recorded](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) a decrease to 206,000 jobs from the revised May 2024 data at 218,000, but this is still higher than the consensus expectation of 190,000. The non-farm payroll data for the April 2024 period was revised down by 57,000 to 108,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the May 2024 data was revised down by 54,000. This downward revision indicates that the US labor market condition is not as strong as previously estimated.

The 10-year US government bond yield also fell -6.9 bps to 4.278%, while the US Dollar Index (DXY) fell -0.24% to the level of 104.88. The slowdown in US labor absorption caused market expectations for a Fed rate cut in September 2024 to increase to 68.2% as of Monday (8/7), according to analysis from the [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html).
