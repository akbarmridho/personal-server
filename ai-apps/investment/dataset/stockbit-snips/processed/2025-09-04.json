      "title": "BI Projects Indonesia Economy +5.3% in 2026",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said that the central bank forecasts Indonesia's economic growth in 2026 to be around +4.7-5.5% year-on-year, with a tendency to be at the +5.3% level as interest rates decline. This projection is higher than the Bank Indonesia forecast for 2025 at +5.1% YoY. Compared with other institutions, the BI projection for 2026 is lower than the government target in the 2026 RAPBN at +5.4% YoY, but higher than the Bloomberg consensus survey in August 2025 at +4.9% YoY and the IMF projection in July 2025 at +4.8% YoY. In line with the growth projection, Perry said the central bank expects banking credit growth to be in the +9-12% YoY range in 2026, higher than the +8-11% YoY projection for this year. The 2026 growth projection is based on monetary and fiscal policy directions: 1. Monetary Policy – Perry stated that Bank Indonesia continues to look for space to cut interest rates further given low inflation, a stable rupiah and the need to boost growth. Bloomberg consensus also expects a further BI Rate cut of -25 basis points to 4.75% by the end of 2025 and another -25 basis points throughout 2026. 2. Fiscal Policy – According to the 2026 RAPBN, consumption and investment are expected to drive growth, with consumption projected to grow +5.2% YoY (vs. the 2025 APBN outlook of +4.7-5% YoY) and investment also projected to grow +5.2% YoY (vs. the 2025 APBN outlook of +4.5-4.7% YoY). Priority programs in the 2026 RAPBN focus on supporting purchasing power, including free nutritious meals, the Red-White Village Cooperatives, and food and energy security. To finance government programs, Bank Indonesia has signed a new burden-sharing agreement with the government, although details on the duration of the scheme and the amount of government bonds to be covered by BI have not been disclosed. Investment is also expected to be boosted by the presence of Danantara. To support spending, the 2026 RAPBN targets a +9.8% YoY increase in state revenue, supported by a +13% YoY rise in tax receipts. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani affirmed that the government will not introduce new taxes or raise tax rates in 2026, but will instead encourage better taxpayer compliance.",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump said he will file an appeal to the Supreme Court as early as Wednesday (3/9) regarding the reciprocal tariff dispute. The statement came after the US Federal Court of Appeals for the Federal District ruled on Friday (29/8) that the reciprocal tariff violates Trump's emergency powers as president. The appellate court did not overturn the tariff, which will remain in effect at least until 14 October 2025 to give the US government time to appeal. Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by the Republican Party, so Trump still has a chance to maintain the tariff.\n2. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings in July 2025 fell by 176,000 to 7.18 million, the lowest level since September 2024 and well below the consensus expectation of 7.4 million. June 2025 openings were also revised down by 80,000 to 7.36 million. The BLS also revised up the number of people experiencing layoffs in June 2025 by 192,000 to about 1.8 million.\n3. Bloomberg surveyed that Malaysia's palm-oil stock rose +2.8% month-on-month in August 2025 to 2.17 million tonnes, the highest since December 2023 and continuing a six-month upward trend. Crude palm-oil production in Malaysia in August 2025 is estimated to increase +2.2% month-on-month to 1.85 million tonnes, the highest in a year, while exports are projected to jump +11% month-on-month to 1.45 million tonnes. The higher supply could pressure CPO futures prices, especially during the high-production cycle that usually peaks in October.\n4. Kompas reported that the Attorney General's Office on Thursday (4/9) named former Education, Culture, Research and Technology Minister Nadiem Makarim as a suspect in a corruption case involving the procurement of Chromebook-based laptops. The head of the AG's Public Information Center, Anang Supriatna, said Nadiem was named a suspect after examining around 120 witnesses and four experts.\n5. Amman Mineral International (AMMN) commissioner Alexander Ramlie bought approximately 230 million AMMN shares at an average price of 8,070 rupiah per share between 28 August and 1 September 2025, a transaction worth about 1.9 trillion rupiah aimed at restructuring share collateral. After this transaction, Ramlie's ownership rose from 0.145% to 0.462%. Previously, Ramlie sold about 283 million AMMN shares for roughly 2.3 trillion rupiah on 26 August 2025.",
