      "title": "Weak US Labor Data, Rate Cut Expectations Strengthen",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded that non-farm payrolls in the US rose by 73 thousand in July 2025, far below the consensus expectation of 110 thousand. The Bureau also significantly revised the non-farm payroll growth data for June 2025 from 147 thousand to only 14 thousand, and the May 2025 data from 144 thousand to 19 thousand. Both data revisions indicate that the labor market might be weakening faster than previously expected. Apart from the non-farm payroll data, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics also noted that the unemployment rate in the US slightly increased to 4.2% in July 2025 (vs. June 2025: 4.1%), in line with consensus expectations. The labor force participation rate in the US dropped by -0.1 percentage point to 62.2% - marking the lowest level since November 2022 - while the employment-to-population ratio also fell by -0.1 percentage point to 59.6%, the weakest level since December 2021. Responding to the labor data release, market expectations for a US interest rate cut strengthened. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 bps at the September 2025 meeting increased to 86% as of today, Monday (4/8), compared to 63% last week. Meanwhile, the probability of an interest rate cut of \b\b\bâ‰¥50 bps until the end of 2025 increased from 64% to 91% as of today. Furthermore, US President Donald Trump fired the Commissioner at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following the announcement of the US labor data on Friday (1/8). Trump accused McEntarfer of rigging the data, while Reuters reported that there was no evidence supporting Trump's claim. A Trump administration official told Reuters that the Trump administration was dissatisfied with inaccurate economic data - especially regarding the significant revisions to the June and May 2025 non-farm payroll data - as well as the declining response rate trend from respondents in the survey conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics since the pandemic era. Besides the employment data issue, surprising news came from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who decided to resign on Friday (1/8). Kugler's decision opens the opportunity for Trump to place a replacement candidate for Fed Chair Jerome Powell earlier within the central bank's board of governors. Previously, Trump was rumored to choose and announce Powell's replacement in September or October 2025, aimed at weakening Powell's position amid differing views on the direction of US interest rates.",

Quarterly, Indonesia's economic growth is projected to grow by +3.7% QoQ (vs. 1Q25: -0.98% QoQ). 2. OPEC+ on Sunday (3/8) agreed to increase oil production by 547 thousand barrels per day in September 2025, continuing the series of production increases since April 2025 to regain market share.

BPS recorded that the value of Indonesian coal exports during 1H25 reached ~$12 billion (-21.1% YoY), with export volume falling to ~184.2 million tons (-6.33% YoY) and the average price dropping to ~$65 per ton (-15.9% YoY). 4. Palm oil stocks in Malaysia are expected to surge to 2.23 million tons in July 2025, according to a Bloomberg survey. This figure marks the highest level since December 2023, implying an increase of +9.9% MoM and +27.4% YoY compared to official data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board in June 2025 and July 2024. Official data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board itself will only be released on August 11, 2025. Head of Research at Sunvin Group, Anilkumar Bagani, told Bloomberg that Malaysian palm oil stocks are expected to increase in July 2025, driven by soaring production and declining consumption during that month. Bagani added that the Malaysian palm oil stock level above 2 million tons during the peak production season is unlikely to severely depress prices, considering that palm oil supply from Indonesia will be limited due to the B40 biodiesel mandate.",
