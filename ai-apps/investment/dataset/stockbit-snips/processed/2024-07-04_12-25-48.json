      "title": "Minor IHSG Evaluation, BBRI Weight Rises 2.25%",
      "content": "The Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) on June 24, 2024 announced the results of the minor evaluation of the IHSG index for the effective period of July 1-September 30, 2024. This evaluation includes changes in the weight of several stocks in the index, with Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) experiencing the most significant weight increase of 2.25 percentage points from 6.75% to 9%. To determine a stock's weight in the IHSG, the IDX uses a free float adjusted index and applies a maximum cap of 9%. In the previous evaluation in March 2024, BBRI received a weight of 9%. However, the decline in BBRI's stock price over the last 3 months caused its weight to drop to 6.75% before the June 2024 evaluation was conducted. The weight increase for BBRI in the June 2024 evaluation was driven by an increase in the maximum quota of BBRI's free float shares calculated by the IDX to determine the weighting in the index. Previously, the number of BBRI free float shares calculated in the March 2024 evaluation was 43.4 billion shares, equivalent to the maximum weight limit of 9% at that time. However, the number of BBRI free float shares calculated in the June 2024 evaluation rose to 60 billion shares and reached the maximum weight of 9%. Although the calculated free float shares increased, BBRI still has remaining free float shares that have not yet been calculated because BBRI free float shares as of May 2024 reached 70.1 billion shares. Following BBRI, several other issuers that experienced the largest weight increases were TPIA (+0.12 percentage point) and MDKA (+0.08 percentage point). Meanwhile, the largest weight decreases were experienced by AMRT (-0.27 percentage point), BMRI (-0.24 percentage point), and AMMN (-0.16 percentage point). The next evaluation of the IHSG index will be conducted in September 2024, with the effective period of October 1-December 31, 2024. Key Takeaway: This weighting can affect investors, especially institutional investors who use the IHSG as a benchmark or passive institutional investors who follow the IHSG index. Since the announcement of the latest index weighting on June 24, 2024, BBRI's stock price has risen about +11% as of July 4, 2024. Furthermore, foreign investors recorded a foreign net buy in BBRI shares of 550 billion rupiah on June 28, or one day before this evaluation's effective period came into force. It is important to note that there are still BBRI free float shares that have not been calculated for IHSG weighting. Consequently, if BBRI's weight falls again in the future due to a stock price decline, BBRI's weighting can rise again.",
