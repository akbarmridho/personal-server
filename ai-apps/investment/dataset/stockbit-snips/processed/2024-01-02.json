      "title": "Indonesia Inflation 2023 Eases to 2.61%, Below Expectations",
      "content": "BPS recorded that the consumer price index (CPI) in Indonesia for December 2023 eased to 2.61% year-on-year (vs November 2023: 2.86% YoY, December 2022: 5.51% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation of 2.72% YoY. The realization aligns with Bank Indonesia's target of 2-4% inflation for 2023.\n\nThe decline in the annual inflation rate in December 2023 also differs from the trend of recent years, where since 2019 inflation tended to increase at year-end. The easing in December 2023 was mainly caused by a high-base effect due to the fuel price increase at the end of 2022.\n\nOn a monthly basis, CPI inflation in December 2023 reached 0.41% month-on-month (vs November 2023: 0.38% MoM). This realization is lower than the consensus expectation of 0.5% MoM, but marks the highest monthly inflation in the past 12 months.\n\nCore inflation in December 2023 eased to 1.8% YoY (vs November 2023: 1.87% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation of 1.85% YoY.\n\nBased on expenditure groups, CPI inflation both monthly and yearly in December 2023 was driven by food, beverages and tobacco, which experienced 1.07% MoM and 6.18% YoY inflation. That group contributed 0.29% to monthly inflation and 1.6% to annual inflation.\n\nResponding to the inflation data release, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up +0.7% at 7,323 on Tuesday (2/1).\n\nKey Takeaway: Inflation being below expectations gives Bank Indonesia room to start cutting the policy rate faster than expected, especially as the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar has strengthened to 15,473 per 1 January 2024 and there are indications of rate cuts by the Fed. Currently, consensus expects Bank Indonesia to begin cutting rates in 3Q24.\n\nRate cuts can have positive impact on interest-sensitive sectors such as:\n\n- Banking: lower cost of funds can improve net interest margin.\n- Property: lower mortgage rates can boost property demand. Moreover, our study finds that property developer stocks tend to rise when rates have peaked and start to be cut. See analysis in Mini Unboxing Property.\n- Technology: investor financing becomes easier with lower rates.\n\nRelated stocks: $ARTO, $GOTO, $BBRI, $BBTN, $PWON, $BSDE, $SMRA",
