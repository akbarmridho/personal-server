      "title": "RI Inflation Rises to 2.75% Amid Soaring Rice Prices",
      "content": "BPS (Central Bureau of Statistics) recorded that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in Indonesia in February 2024 rose to 2.75% YoY (vs. January 2024: 2.57% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of 2.6% YoY and marking the highest level since November 2023. The increase in inflation in February 2024 was driven by the rise in basic food prices, such as rice prices which increased by +5.32% MoM and +19.28% YoY. The surge in rice prices occurred amid an increase in paddy field prices at the farmer level. BPS noted that the price of main harvest dry paddy increased by +4.86% MoM and +27.14% YoY in February 2024, while the price of milled dry paddy increased by +6.13% MoM and +33.48% YoY. Besides rice, the Deputy for Production Statistics at BPS, M. Habibullah, stated that the prices of chicken meat, chili, and sugar were also the largest contributors to inflation in February 2024. According to an economist at Bank Danamon Indonesia, Irman Faiz, the rise in food prices in February 2024 was also driven by seasonal patterns ahead of Ramadan. On a monthly basis, CPI inflation reached 0.37% MoM in February 2024 (vs. January 2024: 0.04% MoM). Meanwhile, core inflation in February 2024 was 1.68% YoY (vs. expectation: 1.71% YoY), stable compared to the previous month and marking the lowest level since December 2021. Since the beginning of the year, CPI inflation in Indonesia reached 0.34% YTD as of February 2024. Bank Indonesia targets inflation in 2024 to be in the range of 1.5-3.5%. Key Takeaway: The Government expects rice prices to start falling following additional supply from the increase in the rice import quota from 2 million tons to 3.6 million tons in 2024, as well as the entry of the main harvest season which falls in March 2024. Successfully controlling rice prices to a more normal level will reduce the burden on inflation. On the other hand, if rice prices remain high, this has the potential to suppress public purchasing power, negatively impacting consumer sector issuers, especially those targeting the lower-middle segment.",

      "content": "BPS recorded that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia in January 2024 reached 927.75 thousand (-18.7% MoM, +16.19% YoY). The government targets 17 million foreign tourist arrivals in 2024. The Head of the Board of Commissioners of the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that LPS will launch the Policy Guarantee Institution (LPP) in 2028. Currently, LPS is still discussing with industry players, OJK, and the Ministry of Finance to determine the appropriate form for the LPP program. Purbaya explained that insurance companies joining the LPP will have their risk-based capital measured. The Finance Director of Medikaloka Hermina (HEAL), Yulisar Khiat, stated that the company targets revenue growth of +16.8% in 2024. To achieve this target, HEAL allocated a capex of 2 trillion Rupiah in 2024. These funds are intended for building 5 new hospitals in IKN, Madiun, Pasuruan, PIK 2, and Pekanbaru, bringing HEAL's total hospitals to 52 units by the end of 2024. Besides establishing new hospitals, Yulisar mentioned that the capex will also be used to increase the bed capacity at existing Hermina hospitals from 4,000 beds to 7,000 beds. On Thursday (29/2), the Constitutional Court abolished the parliamentary threshold provision of 4% of the national valid votes, deeming it inconsistent with the principle of people's sovereignty, electoral justice, and violating legal certainty guaranteed by the constitution. However, the abolition of the parliamentary threshold will not apply to the 2024 election, but rather to the 2029 election.",
