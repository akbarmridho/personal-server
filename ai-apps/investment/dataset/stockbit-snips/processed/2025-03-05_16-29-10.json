      "title": "Adaro Group Performance Compilation 2024",
      "content": "The Adaro Group announced its performance throughout 2024. Here are the details based on each issuer: Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI) - AADI registered a net profit of US$1.21 billion during 2024 (+5.9% YoY). This result was slightly below our expectations (94.8% of Stockbit estimates), but in line with consensus expectations (98.3% of consensus estimates). A comparison of AADI's quarterly and annual performance in 4Q24 cannot be made because there is no performance data for 3Q24 as it was still consolidated within Alamtri Resources Indonesia (ADRO). The growth in AADI's net profit during 2024 was mainly driven by a ~30x increase in other income to US$339 million, in line with a US$322.9 million gain from the sale of its stake in Adaro Minerals Indonesia (ADMR). On the operational side, AADI's revenue declined -10.1% YoY during 2024 due to a decrease in average selling price (ASP) of -16.5% YoY, even though sales volume grew +7.4% YoY. On the cost side, the cost of goods sold in 2024 decreased by only -8% YoY, causing the gross profit margin to fall to 27.6% (vs. 2023: 29.2%). For 2025, AADI targets thermal coal sales volume of around 65-67 million tons, 1.6-4.5% lower YoY than the 2024 realization, with a stripping ratio of 4.3x (vs. 2024 realization: 4.4x). AADI itself allocates capex of around US$250-300 million during 2025. Alamtri Resources Indonesia ($ADRO) - ADRO registered a net profit of US$1.38 billion during 2024 (-15.9% YoY), in line with consensus expectations (102.5% of consensus estimates). A comparison of ADRO's quarterly and annual performance in 4Q24 cannot be made because there is no proforma performance data for 3Q24 that deconsolidates AADI. The weakening net profit was caused by a decrease in revenue from discontinued operations (-23.5% YoY) following the loss of control in AADI which was spun off in December 2024. For the 2024 fiscal year, ADRO still recognized revenue from AADI up to December 6, 2024. Excluding the profit from AADI, ADRO's net profit from continuing operations only fell by -2.4% YoY. Operationally, ADRO recorded a revenue decline of -2.7% YoY during 2024, mainly caused by a decrease in mining services segment revenue (-12.9% YoY). Meanwhile, on the cost side, an increase in operating expenses of +49.4% YoY during 2024 caused the operating profit margin to shrink to 35.3% (vs. 2023: 36.2%). Adaro Minerals Indonesia ($ADMR) - ADMR registered a net profit of US$105 million in 4Q24 (+25.8% QoQ, -45.1% YoY), resulting in a net profit for 2024 of US$437 million (-1% YoY) and slightly above consensus expectations (105% of consensus estimates). The quarterly net profit increase in 4Q24 was due to a revenue increase (+33.9% QoQ), supported by a volume increase of +50.8% QoQ amid a decrease in ASP of -11.2% QoQ. On the other hand, the surge in the cost of goods sold (+35% QoQ) and operating expenses (+69.5% QoQ) caused the operating profit margin to decrease to 41.5% in 4Q24 (vs. 3Q24: 42.7%). For 2025, ADMR targets metallurgical coal sales volume of around 5.6-6.1 million tons (vs. 2024 realization: 5.6 million tons), with a stripping ratio of 3.3x (vs. 2024 realization: 3.6x). ADMR allocates capex of around US$300-325 million during 2025 (vs. 2024 allocation: US$600-700 million). Key Takeaway: For 2025, besides being influenced by coal price fluctuations, Adaro group performance will also be affected by sales volume and stripping ratio. Based on guidance, we see AADI's performance potentially declining in line with lower sales targets than the 2024 realization amidst a stable stripping ratio target. Meanwhile, ADMR and ADRO's performance has the potential to remain stable or weaken slightly in line with potential sales volume increases amid the weakening trend of metallurgical coal prices.",

As of Wednesday (5/3), the government had not yet reported the State Budget balance as of January 2025, with the Ministry of Finance stating this was due to a busy schedule. The government usually holds a briefing regarding the State Budget position 2-3 weeks after the end of the preceding month.

      "content": "The International Tin Association reported that the authorities of Wa State in Myanmar have indicated their readiness to accept applications for mining and processing permits at the Man Maw tin mine, signaling that the mine might reopen later this year since it was suspended in August 2023. Myanmar is the world's third-largest tin producer after China and Indonesia, and the Man Maw mine—before its suspension—was the largest tin producer in the country. Nevertheless, metal columnist at Reuters, Andy Home, explained that the announcement from the Wa State authorities is only the first step toward fully reopening the Man Maw mine, considering it will take at least several months for workers—especially from China—to obtain work permits and relocate back to Myanmar, even after mining permits are granted. Home also argued that the return of the Man Maw mine will not immediately solve the global tin supply issue, given that one large tin mine in Congo is experiencing increased risk from local rebels.",

According to ANRPC, global natural rubber production in 2025 is expected to grow by only +0.3% YoY to 14.9 million tons, while demand is projected to grow +1.8% YoY to 15.6 million tons. Specifically for Indonesia, ANRPC forecasts natural rubber production in Indonesia in 2025 to fall by -9.8% YoY to 2.04 million tons. Nair explained that the current global shortage of natural rubber is caused by low replanting efforts due to low prices over the last 7-8 years, before natural rubber prices reached a 13-year high at the end of 2024.",
