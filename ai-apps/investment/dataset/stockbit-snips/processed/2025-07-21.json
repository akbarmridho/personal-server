      "title": "RI Aims for 0% Tariff for Premium Exports to the US",
      "content": "Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, said that the government is working to achieve a 0% tariff for a number of premium export commodities to the United States, such as crude palm oil (CPO), coffee, cocoa, and nickel. He noted that the commodities proposed for the 0% tariff may still change because a final list has not been established. As a substitute, Susiwijono mentioned that US technology products will be exempted from the domestic component requirement (TKDN). He added that all US goods imported into Indonesia will not be subject to any tariff, except alcoholic beverages and pork meat. Some US goods will also be exempt from import quota rules. Susiwijono is optimistic that tariff negotiations can be reached, especially for commodities highly demanded by the US. Indonesia is the main supplier of CPO to the US, contributing 85% of total US CPO imports in 2024. Meanwhile, the US is the fourth largest destination for Indonesian CPO exports, accounting for about 7% of total Indonesian CPO export volume in 2023. Previously, President Prabowo Subianto's advisor and member of the National Economic Council, Mari Elka Pangestu, told Bloomberg last week that after securing a 19% tariff, Indonesia will continue negotiating with the US on sectoral tariffs, Boeing aircraft purchases, and important minerals. Pangestu also explained that Indonesia will grant broader access for US imports that do not directly compete with Indonesian products, such as wheat and cotton. Key Takeaway: Reducing tariffs for the mentioned commodities could positively impact Indonesian exports, but the effect may not be very significant, according to us. This is because demand for Indonesia's two flagship commodities—CPO and nickel—is dominated by China (and also India for CPO). We assess that investors will still focus, at least in the near term, on domestic economic developments, especially the government's efforts to boost purchasing power. Recent economic indicator data—such as credit growth, car sales, and cement sales—show that the domestic economy remains challenging.",
