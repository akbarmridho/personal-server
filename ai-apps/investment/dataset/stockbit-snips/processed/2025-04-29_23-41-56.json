      "title": "BMRI 1Q25: Net Profit +4% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri ($BMRI) recorded a net profit of 13.2 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+4% YoY, -4% QoQ), relatively in line with expectations (23% of 2025F consensus estimate). Maintaining asset quality is a positive aspect, but low NIM and high OPEX increase are concerns for us. Annual net profit growth aligns with Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) growth, which was more driven by Non-Interest Income (+15% YoY) compared to Net Interest Income (+6% YoY). 1. Asset Quality Relatively Maintained. Credit cost (CoC) was recorded at 0.9% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 1.1%, 4Q24: 0.6%), better than management's 2025 guidance targeting a range of 1-1.2%. NPL remains relatively stable at 1.2% (vs. 1Q24: 1.2%, 4Q24: 1.1%), while LAR slightly increased from the year-end level to 7.2% (vs. 1Q24: 8.4%, 4Q24: 6.8%). BMRI management revealed that the LAR increase was also due to temporary restructuring for corporate clients in the nickel sector. Although the realization of CoC was low in 1Q25, management maintains the CoC guidance for 2025, considering the high level of uncertainty. 2. NIM Under Pressure, Projected to Recover in 2H25. Interest expense rose significantly by +24% YoY in 1Q25 in line with BMRI's priority to maintain liquidity, reflected in the increase in bank-only Cost of Fund (CoF) to 2.38% (vs. 1Q24: 2.07%, 4Q24: 2.31%). Additionally, bank-only Loan Yield also decreased to 7.64% (vs. 1Q24: 7.73%, 4Q24: 7.85%) due to lower yield in the corporate segment following the SOFR decline. The dynamics of CoF and Loan Yield caused NIM in 1Q25 to only reach 4.8% (vs. 1Q24: 5.1%, 4Q24: 5.3%), below management's 2025 guidance in the range of 5-5.2%. Previously, in the 4Q24 analyst meeting, BMRI management projected that NIM would tend to be low in 1H25 before recovering in 2H25, driven by better liquidity conditions from the BI Rate decrease and increased government spending. This projection was maintained by BMRI management at the 1Q25 analyst meeting, so management still maintained the 2025 NIM guidance. 3. OPEX Surged to Support CASA Growth. OPEX rose sharply to 15.2 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+16% YoY, -19% QoQ), continuing the trend seen in 4Q24. This increase was driven by a +19% YoY rise in labor costs, attributed by BMRI management to increased employee incentives and bonuses - especially at regional offices - aimed at boosting cheap funding growth (CASA). This OPEX increase was also reflected in the Cost-to-Income (CIR) Ratio in 1Q25 at 40.8% (vs. 1Q24: 38.2%, 4Q24: 47.9%). Management targets to keep this ratio not exceeding 40% by year-end (vs. 2024: 40%). Key Takeaway: Tight liquidity conditions remain the main challenge for BMRI, similar to what was experienced by Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI). The success of BMRI's initiative to grow CASA - thus reducing the need for Time Deposits - in supporting liquidity is a factor investors need to monitor. In the near term, the intention to slow credit growth until year-end will reduce pressure on the company's liquidity. Regarding risks from global tariffs, BMRI management explained that based on their stress test - assuming oil prices at 30 US dollars per barrel - NPL will still remain below 3%, making BMRI quite confident in their asset quality.",

      "title": "GOTO 1Q25: Positive Proforma Adjusted EBITDA Rp393 Billion",
      "content": "1. $GOTO: GoTo Gojek Tokopedia recorded a proforma adjusted EBITDA of 393 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: minus 101 billion rupiah, 4Q24: positive 399 billion rupiah). On the bottom-line, the proforma net loss narrowed to 276 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: loss of 420 billion rupiah, 4Q24: loss of 1.1 trillion rupiah). 2. $KLBF: Kalbe Farma recorded a net profit of 1.1 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+12% YoY, +25% QoQ), slightly above expectations (31% of 2025F consensus estimate). Net profit growth was driven by revenue increase and margin expansion. Revenue grew to 8.8 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+6% YoY, +5% QoQ), equivalent to 25% of 2025F consensus estimate. Meanwhile, operating profit margin increased to 15.6% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 14.6%, 4Q24: 13.9%) in line with the increase in gross profit margin to 41.6% (vs. 1Q24: 39.7%, 4Q24: 41%). 3. $BNGA: Bank CIMB Niaga recorded a net profit of 1.8 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+7.4% YoY, +6.6% QoQ), slightly above expectations (26% of 2025F consensus estimate). Operating profit performance was supported by a decrease in provision expenses to 316 billion rupiah (-36% YoY, -4.2% QoQ), which was also reflected in the decrease in credit cost (CoC) to 0.46% (vs. 4Q24: 0.8%, 1Q24: 0.82%) and better than management's 2025 guidance targeting ~1%. BNGA management stated that the drop in CoC was due to a one-off reversal, so the CoC will normalize to ~1% by the end of 2025. Furthermore, NIM was recorded at 3.99% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 4.2%, 4Q24: 3.88%), in line with management's 2025 guidance in the range of 3.9-4.2%. Loan Yield rose again to 8.35% (vs. 4Q24: 8.23%, 1Q24: 8.64%) after experiencing a declining trend in 2024, although Cost of Fund (CoF) was at its highest level since 1Q20 at 3.61% in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: 3.58%, vs 1Q24: 3.41%). This dynamic resulted in Net Interest Income (NII) being relatively flat at 3.3 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+1% YoY, +1.8% QoQ). 4. $MYOR: Mayora Indah recorded a net profit of 689 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (-38% YoY, -30% QoQ), below expectations (21% of 2025F consensus estimate). The decline in net profit was pressured by a decrease in operating profit to 846 billion rupiah (-36% YoY, -28% QoQ) as the gross profit margin shrank to 21.9% (vs. 1Q24: 27.8%; 4Q24: 20.9%) and OPEX increased to 1.3 trillion rupiah (+18% YoY, +31% QoQ). Meanwhile, revenue grew to 9.9 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+13% YoY, -5% QoQ), equivalent to 25% of 2025F consensus estimate. 5. $LPPF: Matahari Department Store recorded a net profit of 643 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (+97% YoY, +213% QoQ), equivalent to 78% of 2024 net profit and 95% of 2023 net profit. This result is in line with LPPF management's clarification which projected proforma net profit in 1Q25 to reach more than 600 billion rupiah. The surge in net profit in 1Q25 was driven by strong sales growth and an increase in operating profit margin. The increase in operating profit margin in 1Q25 was driven by an expanding gross profit margin and operating leverage due to the shift in Eid al-Fitr seasonality. Sales grew to 2.4 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+21% YoY, +62% QoQ), with same store sales growth (SSSG) of +28.6% YoY (vs. 1Q24: +34.6% YoY, 2024: -1.7% YoY). Operating profit margin rose to 35.4% (vs. 1Q24: 24.9%, 4Q24: 18.7%) driven by: 1) gross profit margin expansion to 68.2% (vs. 1Q24: 65.4%, 4Q24: 67.8%); and 2) a decrease in opex-to-sales to 33.7% (vs. 1Q24: 40.8%, 4Q24: 46.1%). 6. $EMTK: Elang Mahkota Teknologi will distribute dividends for the 2024 fiscal year amounting to ~2 trillion rupiah or 33 rupiah per share, equivalent to a ~137% dividend payout ratio and indicating a 6.2% dividend yield as of Tuesday (29/4). The cum date and payment date have not yet been announced. 7. $AUTO: Astra Otoparts shareholders approved the plan to distribute dividends for the 2024 fiscal year amounting to ~916 billion rupiah or equivalent to a 45% dividend payout ratio, indicating a final dividend of 133 rupiah per share and a final dividend yield of 6% as of Tuesday (29/4). The cum date in the regular and negotiation markets has not been announced, while payment is on May 28, 2025. Previously, AUTO had distributed an interim dividend for the 2024 fiscal year of 57 rupiah per share in October 2024. 8. $ELSA: Elnusa recorded a net profit of 187 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (+15% QoQ, +1.9% YoY), in line with our expectations (25.1% of Stockbit 2025F estimate). Net profit growth was supported by a decrease in cost of revenue (-2.3% QoQ) and operating expenses (-8.4% QoQ), causing the gross profit margin to rise +180 bps QoQ to 10.3% and the operating profit margin to increase +220 bps QoQ to 6.2%. The increase in gross profit margin was mainly contributed by the improvement in margin in the upstream oil and gas services segment by +870 bps QoQ to 13.1%, along with the low-base effect in 4Q24. Core profit - or net profit excluding exchange gains/losses and one-off gains - stood at 175 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (+53.3% QoQ, +0.5% YoY), in line with our expectations (23.2% of Stockbit 2025F estimate). 9. $ULTJ: Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Company recorded a net profit of 365 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (-10% YoY, +43% QoQ). The annual decrease in net profit was mainly caused by weak operational performance. Operating profit dropped to 395 billion rupiah (-16% YoY, +78% QoQ) due to a surge in advertising and promotion expenses (+70% YoY, -52% QoQ) amidst relatively flat revenue (-0.6% YoY, -0.3% QoQ). Although still high, advertising and promotion expenses fell by -52% QoQ, thus contributing to the improving quarterly net profit. 10. $MTEL: Dayamitra Telekomunikasi recorded a net profit of 526 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (+1% YoY, -9% QoQ), in line with expectations (24% of 2025F consensus estimate). Revenue was recorded at 2.3 trillion rupiah (+1% YoY, -9% QoQ), slightly below expectations (23% of 2025F consensus estimate) due to delayed revenue recognition following contract renewal processes with customers. Tenant count grew to 60,259 (+4% YoY, +1% QoQ), with the number of towers increasing to 39,593 units (+4% YoY, +0% QoQ) and fiber length increasing to 53,544 km (+48% YoY, +5% QoQ). For context, MTEL management targets 62,368 tenants throughout 2025, with fiber length reaching 61,039 km.",

On Sunday (27/4), Bessent also mentioned that he did not know whether US President Donald Trump had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding tariff negotiations. Previously, Trump last week claimed that the US government was talking with China to reach a tariff agreement, although this claim was denied by the Chinese government. Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, in a BRICS meeting on Monday (28/4) warned countries subject to US tariffs not to give in to tariff threats. Wang stated that de-escalation of the trade war would only make the \"bully\" act further. On Tuesday (29/4), the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also released a video containing an oath that the Chinese government would not yield to tariff pressure from the US, while claiming that it was also for the good of the world. Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government bond market during April 2025 has the potential to experience the first monthly net foreign outflow since November 2024 due to eroding investor confidence caused by global economic instability and the depreciation of the Rupiah exchange rate. Based on Ministry of Finance data as of April 22, 2025, Indonesian government bonds experienced a net foreign outflow of 221 million US dollars since the beginning of this month.",
