He suggested that regional heads be selected by the DPRD, similar to the process during the Suharto era. It is unclear whether the proposal will become regulation. Political analyst Yoes C. Kenawas told Reuters that the proposal is unreasonable and could set back democracy in Indonesia, as pilkada remains the best way for the public to ensure accountable regional leaders.",

On Friday (13/12) the rupiah weakened to IDR 16,008 per USD before closing down 0.43% at IDR 15,995 per USD. Edi said the weakness was driven by global sentiment, a strong US dollar and geopolitical tensions. The rupiah has depreciated more than 5% this quarter, according to Bloomberg.",

This is the fourth rate cut in 2024 and reflects an improving inflation outlook, with inflation projected to fall to 2.4% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Nevertheless, borrowing costs remain tight because previous rate hikes still affect existing loans. The ECB also projected slower economic recovery than previously expected, forecasting GDP growth of 0.7% in 2024, 1.1% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026.",

      "content": "Anak usaha Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua (PANI), Bangun Kosambi Sukses (CBDK) announced it will carry out an IPO offering up to 566.89 million (10%) new shares at a price range of IDR 3,000-4,060 per share. This implies the IPO targets proceeds of around IDR 1.7-2.3 trillion, with a valuation of approximately IDR 17-23 trillion. CBDK operates in the real estate sector in the PIK 2 area, a joint venture between the Agung Sedayu Group and the Salim Group. CBDK became a subsidiary of PANI after being acquired using a right issue in August 2022. The full prospectus is not yet available. According to CBDK's 1H24 financial report, the company and its subsidiaries and associated entities hold a consolidated land bank of 735.2 hectares, 50% of which is undeveloped. After the IPO, the shareholder structure will be PANI (45.9%), Agung Sedayu Group (22.05%), PT Tunas Mekar Jaya/Salim Group (22.05%) and the public (10%). The market cap valuation at IPO is lower than its NAV of IDR 107 trillion, representing a discount to NAV of about 78-84%. The NAV is considered reasonable due to a landbank premium, including the PIK 2 land. The IPO proceeds will be used for equity investment in an affiliate, PT Industri Pameran Nusantara, to finance a MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) building project. The bookbuilding will run from 13-20 December 2024, with the public offering expected on 3-9 January 2025 and listing anticipated on 13 January 2025.",
