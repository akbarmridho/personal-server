      "title": "AADI: Listing on IDX and PUPS exercise starting 6 Dec",
      "content": "Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI) officially listed on the IDX today, Thursday (5/12). Amid lively short-term trading discussions around the AADI IPO, we assess that investors can also consider fundamental factors for a long-term investment, especially the dividend yield. Valuation Potential Re-rating to 5-7x P/E: We forecast AADI's net profit for FY25F to decline to 934 million USD (down 27.5% YoY) due to the loss of a one-off gain from a subsidiary sale, with core profit only down 3.2% YoY. However, given the low IPO valuation of 2.9x P/E FY25F, we see high upside potential with a re-rating to 5x P/E FY25F (9,650 IDR per share, +74% from the IPO price). We consider a 5x P/E valuation as fair and conservative because it is lower than the five-year historical average P/E of its parent, Alamri Resources Indonesia (ADRO), which stands at 6.9x P/E. This valuation also lies between Bukit Asam (PTBA) at 7.3x P/E FY25F and Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITMG) at 4.8x P/E FY25F. If AADI can re-rate to the five-year ADRO average of 6.9x and approach PTBA's ~7x P/E, the implied price would be 13,525 IDR per share (+144% from the IPO price). Dividend Yield up to ~17% assuming 50% DPR: In addition to the coal price outlook we expect to remain stable, we see AADI's dividend potential for FY2025 reaching about 966 IDR per share, implying a dividend yield of roughly 17% based on the IPO share price of 5,550 IDR. This assumes a dividend payout ratio (DPR) of 50%, which is the three-year average DPR of ADRO. The yield is higher than other large coal producers such as ITMG and PTBA. Although management stated in the prospectus a plan to distribute dividends with DPR up to 45%, we consider a 50% DPR assumption not aggressive given the company has no large capex plans in the near term. With a 50% DPR and the annual net profit level, we also judge that AADI has sufficient funds to develop its two coal mines, Pari Coal and Ratah Coal, if needed. Main Assumptions in Our Analysis: - Average Newcastle coal price of 135 USD per ton in 2024 and 130 USD per ton in 2025, reflecting a normalization from the current level of 134.8 USD per ton. - Sales volume of 63 million tons in 2024 (down 0.6% YoY) and 64 million tons in 2025 (up 1.6% YoY). - Cash costs of 56.2 USD per ton in 2024 (down 12% YoY) and 57.8 USD per ton in 2025 (up 2.9% YoY). - Non-operating income drops sharply in 2025 (down 89.4% YoY) due to the loss of the one-off gain from asset disposals. Key Takeaway: Although many investors may buy AADI for short-term trading opportunities, we view AADI as a solid fundamental investment given the relatively stable coal outlook and significant, recurring dividend yield. Starting Friday (6/12) through Tuesday (10/12) at 10:00 WIB, investors holding rights to exercise AADI PUPS (ADRO-H) can do so on the Stockbit app. The dividend that can be used for the ADRO-H exercise will be credited on Friday (6/12). AADI rose 19.8% to 6,650 IDR per share today (5/12); the exercise price is 5,971 IDR per share (including a 0.18% transaction fee as stipulated in the PUPS prospectus). How to exercise ADRO-H on Stockbit: 1. Swipe right on ADRO-H in the Portfolio page, then click Exercise. 2. Enter the amount of ADRO-H you wish to exercise, then click Exercise.",
