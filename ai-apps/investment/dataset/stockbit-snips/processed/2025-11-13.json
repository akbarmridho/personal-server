In general, the loss in 3Q25 was driven by the continued booking of post-merger integration costs, causing the gross profit margin to shrink to 13.8% (vs. 3Q24: 28%, 2Q25: 16.7%), resulting in gross profit in 3Q25 dropping -10% QoQ.",

      "content": "After experiencing a decrease in ARPU post-merger to 35,500 rupiah in 2Q25, EXCL recorded a quarterly increase in ARPU to 38,900 rupiah in 3Q25 (-6% YoY, +9.6% QoQ). Meanwhile, the number of customers dropped quarterly to 79.6 million (+35.8% YoY, -3.6% QoQ), which according to EXCL management was caused by the culling of low-ARPU service packages. Management itself explained that the company will focus more on customer segments that can provide higher added value, reflected in the revenue per data (data yield) in 3Q25 which increased quarterly to 2.6 rupiah per MB (-10.7% YoY, +5.1% QoQ). Furthermore, the net loss in 3Q25 was primarily caused by an increase in the cost of goods sold (+13% QoQ) and opex (+5% QoQ), as full integration costs began to be booked since the merger became effective on April 16, 2025. The increase in the cost of goods sold in 3Q25 was driven by an increase in depreciation expense (+14% QoQ) following the acceleration of depreciation on assets that are no longer in use, including network equipment related to the 900 MHz spectrum which must be returned by the end of 2026. EXCL management explained that integration costs will continue until the integration process is complete by 4Q26 or 1Q27. EXCL has budgeted integration costs of 1.5 trillion rupiah throughout 2025, of which approx. 1 trillion rupiah has been booked during 9M25 and the remainder in 4Q25. For 2026, the company expects integration costs to remain around the same level as 2025. If one-off expenses—such as integration, accelerated depreciation, and impairment—are set aside, management estimates the company still achieved a normalized profit after tax of approximately 1.2 trillion rupiah in 3Q25. Looking at the revenue realization during 9M25 which reached only 73% of the 2025F consensus estimate (vs. 9M24: 74% annual realization), we assess that the consensus estimate is still achievable, considering the quite high quarterly ARPU increase in 3Q25 and management's expectation that there is still room to raise ARPU in the coming quarter.",
