      "title": "OPEC+ Will Postpone Planned Production Increase",
      "content": "OPEC+ delegates have stated that the organization is getting closer to an agreement to postpone the planned increase in oil production of 180 thousand barrels per day (bpd) by three months, which was previously scheduled to start in January 2025. This plan is an effort by OPEC+ to maintain oil supply amidst still weak oil prices (Brent) hovering around the level of ~$70 per barrel (-2.5% YTD). Brent prices even briefly touched a level below 70 US dollars per barrel last September (10/9), marking the lowest level since the end of 2023. The formal decision is scheduled to be made on Thursday (5/12). OPEC+ itself has undertaken various efforts to support oil prices. In total, OPEC+ has implemented production cuts of 5.86 million bpd - equivalent to 5.7% of global demand - since 2022. These cuts consist of voluntary cuts of 2.2 million bpd and production cuts of 3.66 million bpd. Initially, OPEC+ planned to start gradually reducing voluntary cuts in October 2024. However, this plan was postponed for two months, or until December 2024, due to weakening oil prices. Despite the plan to postpone the planned production increase, total OPEC+ production is still expected to increase in 2025. In June 2024, OPEC+ agreed on a production increase plan for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of 300 thousand bpd gradually starting in January 2025. Additionally, Kazakhstan also has plans to expand the Tengiz oil field, which potentially increases its oil production. Following the news of the production postponement, Brent prices strengthened by more than +2% in Tuesday's (3/12) trading and rose slightly again by +0.2%, nearing the level of 74 US dollars per barrel today (4/12). Driven by this positive sentiment, the share prices of oil and gas producers such as MEDC (+5.6%) and ENRG (+3.4%) strengthened in today's trading. Key Takeaway: We assess that OPEC+'s commitment to maintaining oil prices by continuously postponing the reduction of production cuts has the potential to keep oil prices on the downside. However, the challenging outlook for China's economic recovery and limited US economic growth potential - which are the two largest oil-consuming countries in the world - could limit the upside for oil prices. Therefore, we expect oil prices to be relatively stable in the range of 70-80 US dollars per barrel in the medium term. According to Valaris - one of the global oil drilling service providers - this oil price level is still considered profitable for oil producers, so exploration interest is likely to remain sustained.",
