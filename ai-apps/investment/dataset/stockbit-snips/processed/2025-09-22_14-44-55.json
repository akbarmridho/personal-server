      "title": "Rupiah Kembali Terdepresiasi ke ~16.600, Terlemah sejak April 2025",
      "content": "The rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar depreciated by -1.19% WoW as of Monday (22/9) to the level of 16,605, marking the weakest level since April 2025 when the rupiah was pressured by the announcement of US reciprocal tariffs. The weakening of the rupiah over the past week was mainly caused by negative sentiment related to issues: 1) Bank Indonesia's independence; and 2) the potential increase in government debt (deficit) to boost economic growth. Last week, Bank Indonesia lowered the BI Rate by 25 bps to 4.75%, below consensus expectations and done before the Fed meeting on September 17, 2025. According to a Reuters report, this decision triggered market concerns about the independence of Bank Indonesia, which was considered to prioritize growth over maintaining the balance between rupiah exchange rate stability and economic growth. Concerns about Bank Indonesia's independence were also fueled by the DPR's discourse to revise Law No. 4/2023 to expand Bank Indonesia's mandate in supporting economic growth and granting authority to the DPR to recommend the dismissal of the Bank Indonesia governor. Meanwhile, fiscal concerns arose along with the increase in the 2026 APBN deficit target from 2.48% to 2.68%. Besides that, there is discourse from the DPR to review the State Finance Law, where this regulation governs the maximum budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP and the maximum total debt limit of 60% of GDP. Nevertheless, the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that the current budget deficit and debt ratio limits do not need to be changed. Fiscal policy itself - especially regarding financing (deficit) - became a spotlight after the change of finance minister from Sri Mulyani, who was known to prioritize discipline in fiscal management. Compared to several neighboring countries, the rupiah currency was the weakest in the last week. The Thai Baht and Philippine Peso strengthened by +0.23% WoW and +0.24% WoW, respectively, while the Malaysian Ringgit, Vietnamese Dong, and South Korean Won weakened by -0.09% WoW, -0.11% WoW, and -0.36% WoW against the US dollar, respectively. This rupiah weakening also burdened the stock price movement of big banks, where BBCA (-3.74% WoW), BMRI (-2.43% WoW) and BBNI (-4.54% WoW) weakened as of Monday (22/9), while BBRI (+0.48% WoW) was still slightly strengthening. Key Takeaway: With the receding external uncertainty - such as the completion of most trade agreements with the US and the start of the US interest rate-cutting cycle by the Fed - we assess that the short-term movement of the rupiah exchange rate will still depend more on domestic factors. In the near future, investors will focus on the impact of several government initiatives to boost economic growth again, such as liquidity injection, economic stimulus packages worth IDR 162 Trillion released by the government for 4Q25, and the acceleration of government spending in general in 2H25.",
