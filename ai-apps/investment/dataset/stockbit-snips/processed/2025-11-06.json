      "content": "Of the issuers entering the 'Global Standard' index, BRMS experienced a decline of -5.88% while BREN strengthened +1.79% in trading on Thursday (6/11). On the other hand, KLBF experienced a deeper decline (-5.3%) compared to ICBP (-1.44%), even though KLBF is still included in the 'Small Cap' index. This mixed price movement indicates that some market participants have anticipated the MSCI review results. For the upcoming index review, investors need to monitor developments regarding MSCI discourse on free float calculation, which will have implications for the potential entry/retention of a stock in the MSCI index. The consultation results regarding this discourse will be announced before January 30, 2026.",
