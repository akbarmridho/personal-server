      "title": "Powell Signals Opening Possibility of Interest Rate Cuts",
      "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his speech on Friday (22 August) local time, signaled that the Fed is opening the possibility of cutting U.S. interest rates at the September 2025 meeting, marking a shift from the central bank's previously hawkish stance amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, Powell emphasized that no definitive decision has been made.\n\nPowell said that based on the Fed's baseline outlook, labor market risk is increasing, while the impact of tariffs on inflation is expected to be only temporary. Prior to his speech, the market had already anticipated a Fed rate cut in September 2025 following weak U.S. labor data for May-July 2025.\n\nPowell also announced that the Fed will revert to Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) as its monetary policy framework going forward. Chief economist at RSM US LLP, Joe Brusuelas, told Reuters that this framework change indicates the Fed will be more inclined toward a higher-for-longer stance, although short-term rate-cut odds have risen.\n\nIn response to Powell's remarks, the probability of a September 2025 rate cut rose from about 83 % a week earlier to about 85 % on Monday (25 August), according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The probability of a cut of 50 basis points or more by year-end increased from about 81 % to about 83 %.\n\nThe Fed meeting will be held on 16-17 September 2025. Before the meeting, the monthly U.S. employment report is scheduled for 5 September 2025, followed by the monthly inflation data the following week, which could influence the Fed's decision.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nA rate cut could boost the appeal of risk assets, including emerging markets such as Indonesia. Following Powell's dovish tone, U.S. equities rose, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gaining +1.52 % and +1.54 % respectively on Friday (22 August). The Indonesian Composite Index (IHSG) rose +0.87 % on the same day, with rate-sensitive sectors like Finance (+1.87 %) and Property (+3.65 %) posting strong gains. A Fed rate cut could also give Bank Indonesia room to lower the BI Rate. Bank Indonesia projects that the Fed may cut rates by about –50 basis points by year-end.",

      "content": "1. World Trade Organization (WTO) panel on Friday (22 August) supported Indonesia on several of its main claims in the dispute over countervailing duties imposed by the European Union on Indonesian biodiesel imports. The EU is Indonesia's third-largest export destination for palm oil products and a key market for biodiesel. Responding to the ruling, Trade Minister Budi Santoso urged the EU to immediately remove the countervailing duties. Reuters reported that the EU may appeal, but a final decision cannot be made because the WTO's highest appellate body has been non-functional since 2019 after the first Trump administration repeatedly blocked judicial appointments. Previously, the EU had imposed countervailing duties of about 8-18 % since 2019 on Indonesian biodiesel, alleging that producers benefited from grants, tax incentives, and access to raw materials below market price. Indonesia brought the dispute to the WTO in 2023, claiming the duties violate WTO rules.\n\n2. The Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) announced that it will begin distributing summary trade data at the end of the first trading session each Monday (25 August), in addition to the usual end-of-day distribution. The files released at the end of the first session will include summary of transaction activity by investor domicile code, index data listed on BEI, and trade recap by investor type. All files will be distributed in the same format as the end-of-day distribution. BEI explained that the availability of this information is expected to help market participants obtain a more comprehensive view of investor participation dynamics and support decision-making in trading on BEI.\n\n3. Commodity analysis firm Kpler estimates that China's seaborne thermal coal imports grew 12.6 % month-on-month to 25.63 million tonnes in August 2025, marking the highest monthly volume since December 2024. Reuters reported that the increase was driven by thermal power plant generation, a decline in domestic coal production in China, and low coal prices. Meanwhile, Kpler projects that India's seaborne thermal coal imports fell 18.8 % month-on-month to 9.74 million tonnes in August 2025, the lowest monthly volume since February 2023. Reuters noted that the decline was pressured by a reduced share of thermal power generation amid rising renewable energy and increased domestic coal production in India.\n\n4. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued a new regulation on mineral price benchmarks (HPM) and coal price benchmarks (HPB) through Ministerial Decree No. 268.K/MB.01/MEM.B/2025, granting mining companies flexibility to sell commodities below the benchmark price while still requiring tax and royalty payments based on HPM or HPB. The Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, Gita Mahyarani, told Kontan that the rule does not bring significant changes for operators and merely reaffirms an already existing mechanism.\n\n5. President Prabowo Subianto on Monday (25 August) inaugurated Brian Yuliarto as the Head of the newly established Mineral Industry Agency, which will oversee the development of rare earths and radioactive materials. Brian currently also serves as Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology.",
