      "content": "Two major US indices - S&P 500 and Nasdaq - printed new all-time high records in Thursday's (10/7) trading, closing up at levels of 6,280.46 (+0.27%) and 20,630.67 (+0.09%) respectively. This rise was partly driven by the strengthening stock price of Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) by +1.22%, marking the first public company record to hold a market cap of 4 trillion US dollars. At a similar time, Bitcoin also recorded an all-time high to the level of ~$118 thousand as investors resumed taking risk-on positions. The rise in US stock exchanges and Bitcoin was primarily caused by the majority of traders beginning to ignore concerns over trade tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, Steve Sosnick, said that most market participants do not pay attention to news about tariffs until the tariffs are actually enacted, considering that it is still possible for the tariffs to be renegotiated, postponed, or modified if there is a reasonable cause. Meanwhile, in the Asian market, the South Korean index (KOSPI) also recorded an all-time high in today's trading, Friday (11/7), and has risen +32.4% YTD.

      "content": "Generally, the rally in the US and South Korean markets was primarily driven by high market participant enthusiasm for the artificial intelligence (AI) trend, which seems to outweigh concerns about US tariff policies. For Indonesia itself, concerns about economic fundamentals and national growth prospects cause low foreign investor interest currently, in our view. We assess that the acceleration of government spending in 2H25 will be a key factor to boost the economy in the short term. Additionally, investors also need to closely monitor the development of Indonesia's trade agreements with the US.",
