      "title": "Danantara Will Invest US$10 Billion Until End of 2025",
      "content": "Chief Investment Officer of Danantara, Pandu Sjahrir, told Reuters on Thursday (02/10) that the firm will invest around US$10 billion or approximately IDR 165 trillion in the first three months of its operations starting in October 2025. Eighty percent of the funds will be allocated to domestic investments, while the remaining twenty percent will be used for overseas investments.\n\nPandu explained that the initial projects to be financed by Danantara include a Hajj village in Saudi Arabia, an upstream energy project with Pertamina, and a waste-to-energy power plant, with several projects expected to start operating by the end of this year. Previously, Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani said on Tuesday (30/9) that the company will launch 33 waste-to-energy projects (PSEL), of which eight projects will be launched at the end of October 2025.\n\nPandu added that Danantara also aims to increase liquidity in the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IHSG), reaffirming his statement in April 2025 when he mentioned that Danantara is ready to become a liquidity provider for the Indonesian stock market.\n\nOver the next two years, Pandu said Danantara will focus on energy security, food security, renewable energy, financial services, healthcare, real estate, and digital infrastructure. Stockbit previously wrote about several potential Danantara investments.\n\nDanantara has obtained financing from various sources, namely: 1) dividends from state-owned enterprises estimated at US$7 billion or about IDR 116 trillion during 2025; 2) issuance of patriot bonds worth IDR 50 trillion for the energy transition sector and others; and 3) multi-currency loans up to US$10 billion or about IDR 165 trillion.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAmong the disclosed investment plans, only Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA) has so far received investment from Danantara through a shareholder loan of US$405 million or roughly IDR 6.7 trillion, which is planned to be followed by a capital contribution. In addition, Krakatau Steel ($KRAS) has requested Danantara to inject capital of US$500 million or about IDR 8.3 trillion – also in the form of a shareholder loan – which is expected to be executed before the end of 2025.",

      "content": "Reuters reported that the National Nuclear Agency is still determining the extent of radioactive contamination by Caesium-137, with ten hotspots identified in the Cikande Modern Industrial Zone. Spokesperson Bara Hasibuan said the agency hopes to know the total contaminated area by early next week. The contamination was first detected in shrimp shipments to the United States in August 2025 from a local company based in the Cikande zone. After thorough scanning, the government said the source is an old iron plant named PT Peter Metal Technology. The Cikande Modern Industrial Zone covers 3,175 hectares and hosts more than 270 companies ranging from food processing to automotive components.\n\nThe Ministry of Communication and Digital temporarily froze the electronic system provider (TDPSE) registration for TikTok Pte. Ltd. after the company refused to share complete live-streaming data during the national demonstrations at the end of August 2025. TDPSE is the operating license for electronic system providers. The impact of the temporary freeze on TikTok's operations in Indonesia remains unknown.\n\nTrade Minister Budi Santoso urged the European Union to remove countervailing duties on certain Indonesian stainless-steel imports. The request follows a World Trade Organization statement on Thursday (02/10) that the EU measures are inconsistent with agreed-upon rules.\n\nFinance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa announced plans to develop a tobacco-industry zone to encourage illegal cigarette manufacturers to become legal. The government will discuss with current operators to determine the most appropriate and fair excise tariff mechanism. While the government offers training and empowerment, it stresses that sanctions will be applied to firms that fail to meet tax obligations.\n\nAlam Sutera Realty controller ($ASRI), PT Manunggal Prime Development, was recorded buying approximately 147.85 million ASRI shares. The transaction, reported in KSEI data on 1 October 2025, did not disclose the transaction value. After the purchase, PT Manunggal Prime Development's ownership in ASRI increased from 26.12% to 26.87%.",
