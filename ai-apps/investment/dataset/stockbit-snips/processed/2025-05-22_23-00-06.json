      "title": "PGAS Adds More Than 71.8 BBtud Gas Supply",
      "content": "PGAS announced new gas supply additions with a volume exceeding 71.83 BBtud, signed during the IPA Convention & Exhibition on Wednesday (21/5). This gas supply originates from several blocks, detailed as follows:\n\nSpecifically for the domestic gas swap agreement, the agreement stipulates that a certain volume of pipeline gas from the Corridor and Jabung Blocks previously sold to Singapore will be replaced by gas from the Natuna Block (South Natuna Sea Block B, Natuna Sea Block A, and Kakap PSC). The volume from the Corridor and Jabung Blocks previously sold to Singapore will be allocated to meet domestic gas demand, with PGAS acting as the domestic buyer.\n\nThe additional gas supply coming from various E&P blocks - both in the form of pipeline gas and LNG - provides supply certainty for the Sumatra and West Java regions. Previously, the President Director of PGAS, Arief S. Handoko, warned that a gas deficit in the West Java up to North Sumatra region would occur between 2025-2035. This decline is caused by natural declining from suppliers, which has not yet been offset by new reserve discoveries and production from new gas fields.\n\nUntil now, it is still unknown whether this additional gas supply will be allocated for the Gas for Certain Electricity Generation (HGBT) incentive price or non-HGBT. Previously, the government set the gas price under the HGBT incentive at 6.5-7 US dollars per MMBtu from January 2025 for the next 5 years. Purchases exceeding the volume quota will be subject to a regasification tariff of 16.77 US dollars per MMBtu.\n\nChairman of the Indonesian Ceramics Association, Edy Suyanto, stated that the fulfillment of the HGBT volume quota is decreasing due to gas supply disruptions. In April 2025, the fulfillment of the HGBT volume quota in West Java fell to 65.3% (vs. March 2025: 77%) and East Java plummeted to 48.8% (vs. March 2025: 61%).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe increase in gas supply from various blocks provides a positive sentiment for PGAS amid declining supply due to natural declining from suppliers. Furthermore, the increase in gas supply from the Corridor and Jabung Blocks potentially increases PGAS's gas sales volume because the price of pipeline gas is cheaper compared to the regasified gas price.\n\nAlthough it is still unknown whether this additional supply will increase the gas volume for HGBT, this additional supply is expected to suppress the blended cost of gas energy used by related industrial sectors. This can benefit companies that rely on gas as their main energy source, such as Arwana Citramulia ($ARNA).",
