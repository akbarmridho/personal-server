      "title": "Base Metals Heat Up, Nickel Breaks US$21,000/ton",
      "content": "Base metals have surged in the past week. According to the London Metal Exchange (LME) three-month futures, nickel rose 11.2% week-over-week (WoW) to US$21,080 per metric ton, copper rose 6.6% WoW to US$10,668 per ton and tin rose 6.7% WoW to US$34,251 per ton.\n\nFactors supporting the rally include:\n- Slowing U.S. inflation – U.S. inflation for April 2024 slowed to 3.4% year-over-year (YoY) versus 3.5% YoY in March, matching consensus expectations. This ends a three-month streak of readings above consensus and revives expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in 2024, potentially boosting economic activity and demand for base-metal commodities.\n- China’s stimulus – On 17 May 2024 the Chinese government began issuing yuan-denominated bonds worth 1 trillion yuan (US$138 billion) to stimulate key sectors of its economy. The stimulus could lift Chinese economic activity and provide a positive sentiment for global commodity prices.\n- Supply-disruption concerns – Riots in New Caledonia, the world’s third-largest nickel producer, have raised fears of a supply disruption for global nickel.\n- Delays in Indonesian mining permits – The approval process for mining work plans (RKAB) remains slow. The government is reported to have provided no update on nickel RKAB status for the past two months. As of the end of March 2024, only 15 tin-mine RKABs had been approved. This could disrupt production. Indonesia accounts for an estimated 50% of global nickel production, 18% of global tin production and 4% of global copper production (U.S. Geological Survey, 2023).\n\nKey Takeaway\nThe rise in base-metal prices could lift average selling prices (ASP) and potentially increase margins for producing issuers.\n\nIn the past week, the proxy issuers for these commodities appreciated as follows:\n- Nickel: $MBMA (+15.18%), $INCO (+14.19%), $ANTM (+8.88%), $NCKL (+6.19%)\n- Copper: $AMMN (+6.6%), $MDKA (+2.53%)\n- Tin: $TINS (+4.3%)",

The chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Industry Association, Edy Suyanto, said the national ceramic industry must pay an average gas price of US$9.44-10 per MMBtu because of limited PGAS supply. The chairman of the Gas Users Forum, Yustinus Gunawan, warned that the cheap-gas quota from PGAS could push de-industrialisation.",
