      "title": "Danantara Releases Patriot Bonds Worth IDR 50 T",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara plans to issue Patriot Bonds worth 50 trillion rupiah on October 1, 2025. This bond issuance will reportedly consist of 2 series, namely 5-year tenor and 7-year tenor, each valued at 25 trillion rupiah with a coupon rate of 2%, far below the yield of similar tenor government bonds in the range of 6%. Due to the low yields, these bonds are said to be offered through private placement to a number of national business leaders. Danantara's Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Pandu Sjahrir, explained that these bonds are a strategic financing instrument commonly used in various countries, such as Japan and the United States (US), to strengthen national financing independence. The issuance of these bonds is supported by several conglomerates such as Prajogo Pangestu, Franky Widjaja, and Boy Thohir. Through its official page, Danantara stated that the funds raised from these bonds will be invested in the energy transition sector and others. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the funds will be used for waste-to-energy (WTE) projects. The issuance of these bonds occurred just one day after the Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, stated that the Presidential Regulation (Perpres) related to WTE is expected to be issued in the next one or two days. Based on PLN's Electricity Provision Business Plan (RUPTL) for 2025, the construction of electricity generation installations based on environmentally friendly technology from waste processing will be located in 12 cities: Palembang, Tangerang, South Tangerang, DKI Jakarta, Bandung, Bekasi, Semarang, Surakarta, Surabaya, Makassar, Manado, and Denpasar, with a total plant capacity of 453 MW up to 2034.",

This result brought the bank only net profit for 7M25 to 28.6 trillion rupiah (-9% YoY), equivalent to 50.3% of the consolidated 2025F consensus estimate (vs. 7M24 bank only: 52.2% realization of 2024 consolidation). The year-on-year increase in net profit in July 2025 was driven by a significant decrease in provision expenses (-55% YoY, -12% MoM), even though Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) was relatively weak at 7.6 trillion rupiah (-28% YoY, -31% MoM). Cumulatively over 7M25, the decrease in net profit was driven by: 1) weak PPOP by -4% YoY due to an increase in opex of +10% YoY; and 2) provision expenses increasing by +4% YoY. As of July 2025, bank only credit growth was recorded at +5% YoY, remaining relatively stable compared to June 2025 growth.",
