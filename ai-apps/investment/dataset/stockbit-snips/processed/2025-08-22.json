      "content": "Several construction issuers – namely Adhi Karya (ADHI), PT PP (PTPP) and Total Bangun Persada (TOTL) – have released the realization of new contract values for the first seven months of 2025 (7M25). Overall, ADHI’s new-contract performance is the weakest among the three, while PTPP records relatively the best performance. The assessment is based on year-over-year growth of new-contract value and achievement against the 2025 target compared with the trend of the previous year.\n\nADHI recorded new-contract value of IDR 3.8 trillion during 7M25 (-68% YoY), representing only about 14-15% of the 2025 target (vs. 7M24: 60% realization in 2024). PTPP recorded new-contract value of IDR 11.8 trillion during 7M25 (-10% YoY), equal to 41% of the 2025 target (vs. 7M24: 48% realization in 2024). From the financial performance aspect, net profit of PTPP and ADHI fell by 56% YoY and 45% YoY respectively during 1H25. In contrast, TOTL’s net profit in 1H25 grew by 55% YoY, supported by strong new-contract growth in 2024 at +21% YoY.",

      "content": "1. Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said on Friday (22 Aug) that the government has redirected part of gas exports to the domestic market to meet demand, after domestic supply was previously disrupted by a fire in a gas pipeline. He added that the government has rescheduled the affected gas exports, without further details. He also claimed that natural gas supply delivered by Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) to industry in West Java and Sumatra has returned to normal.\n\n2. Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, said in a meeting with the DPR on Friday (22 Aug) that the central bank projects the rupiah-dollar exchange rate in 2026 to be around 16,000-16,500 per USD, slightly weaker than the previous projection of 15,900-16,400 per USD.\n\n3. Bank Indonesia reported that broad money (M2) in July 2025 grew 6.5% YoY (vs June 2025: 6.4% YoY), driven by narrow money (M1) growth of 8.7% YoY and quasi-money growth of 4.8% YoY. The M2 increase was mainly influenced by net foreign asset growth of 7.3% YoY and a contraction of net claims to the central government of 6.2% YoY.\n\n4. Reuters reported that Indian importers bought palm oil from Colombia and Guatemala for the first time, as producers in those countries have surplus stocks and offered cargoes at large discounts. The increased production in Colombia and Guatemala – and their ability to shift supply with discounted prices – could pressure the futures price of palm oil in Malaysia. The Vice President of Patanjali Foods Ltd., Aashish Acharya, said the first Indian purchase from Latin America could open more supply options. Latin America produces about 5 million tonnes of palm oil per year, half of which is exported elsewhere. Indonesia and Malaysia still dominate global palm oil supply and are the main suppliers to India, which imported 9 million tonnes in 2023/2024. Colombia and Guatemala are the 4th and 6th largest palm oil producers worldwide, usually exporting surplus to Europe and North America.\n\n5. Member of the National Social Security Board, Muttaqien, said on Thursday (21 Aug) that discussions on raising the national health insurance premium managed by BPJS Kesehatan have entered the finalization stage, though details were not disclosed. Previously, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in February 2025 that the ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance and BPJS Kesehatan, were calculating the premium increase, with the new tariff planned to take effect in 2026.",
