      "title": "Compilation of 2024 Emiten Performance: Part 2 (Industrials)",
      "content": "After releasing the compilation of emiten performance in the consumer-related sector in Stockbit Snips Part 1, we also prepared a compilation of FY24 performance of emiten that are closely related to the industrials sector, including cement, building materials, automotive, utilities, industrial property, and industrial supports. The details of revenue, operating profit, and net profit for each sector are presented. Key Takeaway: Overall, the revenue trend of industrial emiten still shows positive year-on-year growth, both in 4Q24 and FY24. Although total revenue grew only a modest +0.1% YoY in 4Q24 and +2% YoY during FY24, this figure is mainly due to the decline in revenue of the industrial support sector (AKRA). Apart from that, revenue in other sectors grew reasonably well. Regarding operating margin, there is a tendency of margin weakening during FY24, although a sign of recovery appears in 4Q24 for the cement and building materials sectors. Consequently, operating profit tends to grow slower than revenue. Bottom-line, there are several drivers for net profit increase in some sectors, such as lower interest and tax expenses in the utilities sector and asset sales in the automotive sector (AUTO). Highlights of some sectors: Industrial property achieved the relatively best performance during FY24, with revenue and net profit growing +25% YoY and +14% YoY respectively, driven by high industrial land sales (SSIA) to BYD. Industrial support (AKRA) recorded negative performance during FY24 with revenue down -8% YoY and net profit down -20% YoY, mainly due to price normalization in the distribution and oil trading segment and lower land sales of JIIPE. The cement sector continued a significant recovery in 4Q24 with net profit up +39% YoY, mainly driven by margin improvement from lower energy costs.
