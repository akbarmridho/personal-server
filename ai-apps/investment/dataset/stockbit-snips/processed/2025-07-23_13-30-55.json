      "title": "US-RI Agrees on Trade Framework",
      "content": "The US White House announced on Tuesday (22/7) local time the framework for trade negotiation agreement with Indonesia. Here are the main points from this agreement:\n\n1. Indonesia will eliminate tariffs on approximately 99% of products originating from the US, covering industrial, food, and agricultural products. Meanwhile, tariffs for goods originating from Indonesia will decrease from 32% to 19%. The White House stated that the US can identify certain commodities that are neither naturally available nor domestically produced in the US for further tariff reduction.\n2. Indonesia will eliminate non-tariff barriers, such as exempting US companies and goods from TKDN requirements, accepting vehicles made according to US federal safety and emission standards, removing import restrictions and licensing requirements for remanufactured US goods or spare parts, and eliminating pre-shipment inspections and verification for US exports.\n3. Indonesian companies will sign commercial agreements with US companies, including: 1) aircraft imports valued at 3.2 billion US dollars; 2) imports of agricultural products, including soybeans, soybean meal, wheat, and cotton with an estimated total value of 4.5 billion US dollars; and 3) imports of energy products, including LPG, crude oil, and gasoline, with an estimated total value of 15 billion US dollars.\n4. Indonesia will cancel the plan to impose tariffs on internet data flows and agree to support the extension of the WTO e-commerce tariff moratorium.\n5. Indonesia agreed to remove export restrictions on industrial commodities, including critical minerals.\n6. The US and Indonesia will negotiate rules of origin to ensure the benefits of this agreement are felt by the US and Indonesia, and not by third-party countries.\n7. Indonesia agreed to join the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity and take action to address global overcapacity in the steel sector.\nThe White House stated that in the coming weeks, the US and Indonesia will still negotiate and finalize the trade agreement before it comes into effect.\n\nKey Takeaway\nOverall, we assess that the main points announced above are relatively in line with previous indications, so this announcement does not have a significant impact on market movements. However, we highlight the point regarding the removal of export restrictions on industrial commodities, which still requires more detailed information to assess its impact.\n\nIn addition, we see that with the trade agreement nearly finalized, the government can return its focus to domestic programs, including the purchasing power issue, which we consider to be the main factor monitored by investors.",
