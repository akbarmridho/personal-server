      "title": "US Inflation Above Expectations, Higher-for-Longer Narrative Strengthens",
      "content": "US statistics bureau on Wednesday (12/2) local time announced that core inflation increased year-on-year in January 2025 and exceeded expectations. Here are the details: YoY Inflation: 3% (vs. consensus: 2.9%, Dec 2024: 2.9%) MoM Inflation: 0.5% (vs. consensus: 0.3%, Dec 2024: 0.4%) Core Inflation YoY: 3.3% (vs. consensus: 3.1%, Dec 2024: 3.2%) Core Inflation MoM: 0.4% (vs. consensus: 0.3%, Dec 2024: 0.2%). This development strengthens the higher-for-longer narrative, especially with the risk of trade war escalation. Before the inflation data release, US President Donald Trump said there would be an announcement of retaliatory tariffs for all countries that impose tariffs on the US. Additionally, Trump also announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the US. The release of this inflation data came just one day after the Fed Head, Jerome Powell, said in testimony to the US Senate that the Fed is in no hurry to cut interest rates, given the current strong economy with low unemployment and inflation remaining above the 2% target. Powell also mentioned that reducing interest rates too quickly or too much could hinder disinflation progress, reaffirming the Fed's position when holding interest rates steady at the January 2025 meeting. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool as of Thursday (13/2), the probability of the Fed cutting US interest rates by more than 25 bps during 2025 fell to only 35.2%, from the previous level of 58.1% on February 6, 2025. Following the release of the inflation data, the US Dollar Index (DXY) briefly increased by +0.05% to the 107.97 level, before closing down -0.39% at the 107.55 level. Meanwhile, the 10-year US government bond yield also increased by +9 bps to the 4.62% level. The US stock market indices closed mixed, with the Dow Jones Index -0.50%, S&P 500 -0.27%, and Nasdaq +0.12%. In Indonesia, the IHSG closed weaker by -0.48% on Thursday (13/2), with the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rising +1 bps to the 6.63% level and the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar strengthening +0.17% to 16,368 rupiah.",

      "content": "Despite the decreasing expectation for a US interest rate cut, the Bloomberg consensus still expects Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by another 50 bps to the 5.25% level by the end of 2025. Previously, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut the BI Rate by 25 bps to the 5.75% level in January 2025 amid a weakening rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar. This decision was taken to encourage economic growth amidst weakening consumption, employment, investment, and exports. This development re-emphasizes that volatility from economic data developments will always exist. With the interest rate cut outlook and future uncertainty, investors can lock in short-term FR bond yields that offer attractive risk-reward with lower volatility risk compared to long-term bonds. Some short-term FRs that can be considered are PBS032 and PBS003, which offer yields in the range of 6.3-6.45% with maturities around 1.5-2 years. *This article was released as Stockbit Commentary on Thursday (13/2) morning.",
