      "title": "Government Releases New Waste-to-Energy Regulation",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto released Presidential Regulation (Perpres) No. 109/2025 concerning the processing of waste into electrical energy (PSEL or waste-to-energy) on October 10, 2025. This new regulation has several important changes compared to the previous regulation, namely Perpres No. 35/2018. Here are some important points of difference (for a more complete comparison, see the table above): \n- Increase in Electricity Purchase Price by PLN. Perpres No. 109/2025 regulates the price of electricity purchased from PSEL operators by PLN at 20 US cents per kWh for all capacities, an increase compared to the previous regulation which ranged from ~13 US cents per kWh depending on the PSEL capacity. \n- Electricity Purchase and Sale Agreement Term of 30 Years. Perpres No. 109/2025 regulates the duration of the electricity purchase and sale agreement from PSEL operators to PLN for 30 years, calculated from when the relevant PSEL is declared to have reached a commercially operational stage. By comparison, the previous regulation did not regulate the duration of the electricity purchase and sale agreement between the PSEL operator and PLN. \n- Elimination of Tipping Fee. The increase in the electricity purchase price by PLN is accompanied by the elimination of the waste management fee scheme (tipping fee). By comparison, under the previous regulation, the PSEL operator received a tipping fee of a maximum of 500,000 rupiah per ton of waste, which was compensation for waste processing services. Apart from the changes contained in the table above, Perpres No. 109/2025 also regulates the role of Danantara in the implementation of PSEL projects, namely: 1) selecting the business entity to develop and manage the PSEL; and 2) carrying out investments in the implementation of PSEL that is viable commercially, financially, and in terms of risk management. The establishment of a PSEL operator itself can be carried out through cooperation between local governments with State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN), Regional-Owned Enterprises (BUMD), or private parties. Danantara CEO, Rosan Perkasa Roeslani, claimed on Thursday (16/10) that there are already 107 prospective investors for waste-to-energy projects in Indonesia, where 53 are domestic and 54 are foreign. Based on the analysis conducted by the Ministry of Environment, there are 10 cities ready to implement this project, namely Jakarta, Tangerang, Bekasi, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Bali, and Makassar. Key Takeaway: The revenue source scheme based on the new regulation - with a higher purchase price from PLN despite no tipping fee - and the long electricity sales contract period have the potential to provide business certainty and increase the financial viability of PSEL projects. On the IDX, there are several issuers that already have and/or plan to have exposure in the waste-to-energy industry or its ecosystem, such as TOBA, OASA, MHKI, HGII, and BIPI.",

      "content": "The yield on 10-year Indonesian government bonds fell -6.6 bps to 5.956% on Thursday (16/10), marking the lowest level since January 2021. This yield decrease was driven by expectations of interest rate cuts and strong domestic demand for state debt securities. President Prabowo Subianto stated on Wednesday (15/10) that he had instructed Danantara to cut the number of State-Owned Enterprises from ~1,000 to ~200. President Prabowo also mentioned that the government has changed regulations to open opportunities for foreign professionals to lead our SOEs. Prabowo\\'s nephew and President Director of PT Arsari Tambang, Aryo Djojohadikusumo, stated on Wednesday (15/10) that his company is discussing the acquisition of mining assets in Canada. Aryo did not specify the target assets to be acquired, but he mentioned that the transaction is valued around 7 trillion rupiah and is expected to be completed by June 2026. PT Arsari Tambang is a tin mining company that operates mainly in the Bangka Belitung region, according to Reuters reports. Kontan reported that heavy equipment manufacturer, LiuGong Indonesia, plans to establish a heavy equipment production facility worth 317 million US dollars in the Artha Industrial Hill Industrial Estate, Karawang Barat. This factory will have a production capacity of up to 5,000 units per year by 2030. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry noted that there are 2 other companies that have submitted investment commitments for factory expansion, namely: 1) PT Qingtuo Automotive Manufacturing Indonesia with an investment of 330 million US dollars; and 2) PT Komatsu Indonesia - an affiliate entity of UNTR - with an investment value of 13.5 million US dollars. Geoprima Solusi (GPSO) stated in clarification to the IDX that PT PIMSF Pulogadung will acquire 45.45% of the company\\'s shares owned by the existing controller, Karnadi Margaka, at an average price of 67.66 rupiah per share or a total value of 20.5 billion rupiah. PT PIMSF Pulogadung had previously purchased 170 million GPSO shares at an average price of 59 rupiah per share on October 14, 2025, thus the direct ownership portion of PT PIMSF Pulogadung in GPSO increased from none to 25.49%. GPSO also mentioned that the company cannot yet confirm the prospective ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) of the company. However, based on the capital structure of PT PIMSF Pulogadung, the strongest prospective UBO of the company is Kurniawan Eddy Tjokro. Boston Furniture Industries (SOFA) announced that its subsidiary, PT Pratama Satya Prima, has added new business activities in waste management and electricity generation. Bloomberg reported that the government will impose a new levy on cocoa bean exports starting October 22, 2025, with rates ranging from 2.5-7.5%. This new levy will be paid to the Plantation Fund Management Agency, which will later be distributed as a support program for farmers to increase production. Meanwhile, the export duty rate for cocoa beans paid to Customs is reduced from a maximum of 15% to a maximum of 7.5%, so the total cost (export levy and export duty rate) paid from export levies and export duty rates remains at 15%.",
