      "title": "The Fed Projects Fewer Interest Rate Cuts in 2025",
      "content": "The Fed cut the benchmark interest rate by 25bps to the 4.25-4.50% level on Wednesday (19/12) local time. This decision was in line with consensus expectations. This cut is the third this year with a total cut of 100bps. Nevertheless, the Fed projects fewer interest rate cuts next year due to slow progress in inflation reduction and caution regarding uncertainty about the US President-elect's policy, Trump. The Fed estimates inflation in 2025 will be at the 2.5% level, higher than the previous estimate of 2.1%. Thus, the Fed only sees interest rate cuts of 50bps (2x25bps) in 2025, lower than the previous projection released in September 2024 of 100bps. Responding to this latest projection, the US stock market weakened, followed by a rise in bond yields and the US dollar index in trading on Wednesday (18/12) local time. - S&P 500 -2.95% - Nasdaq -3.56% - DJIA -2.65% - DXY +1% - UST 10Y +11.5bps. The Indonesian capital market also weakened in today's trading (19/12). IHSG fell -1.84% with the benchmark government bond yield for the 10-year tenor rising +43 bps to the 7.10% level. The Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened -1.24% to the 16,290 level.",

      "content": "The prospect of fewer interest rate cuts by the Fed could limit the room for Bank Indonesia to cut rates. As of Thursday (19/12), the consensus compiled by Bloomberg still projects Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates by ~75bps in 2025. Amid market volatility, this moment can be utilized by investors to buy government bonds FR with higher yields. We favor the PBS032 series (maturing in ~1.5 years) which offers a yield of 6.93%, as of Thursday (19/12). Short-term FR bonds have relatively lower volatility risk compared to long-term FR bonds, especially if there is uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of interest rate cuts.",

The cancellation of the bipartisan budget—which includes $100.4 billion in disaster aid, economic assistance for struggling farmers, funding to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, and a pay raise for parliament members—could trigger a US federal government shutdown as early as Saturday (21/12), disrupting all activities in the US from air travel to law enforcement ahead of the Christmas holidays. If realized, this would mark the first US government shutdown since late December 2018 to early 2019, when Trump served his first term. Trump threatened that Republican parliament members who support the bipartisan budget would struggle to get re-elected because they would face challenges within the party.",
