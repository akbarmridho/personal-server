      "title": "ðŸ“ˆ NCKL 9M24: Net Profit +8.4% YoY, Exceeding Expectations",
      "content": "Trimegah Bangun Persada ($NCKL) recorded the highest quarterly net profit since its IPO in 3Q24, realizing 2 trillion rupiah (+12.6% QoQ, +18.2% YoY). This result brings the net profit for 9M24 to 4.8 trillion rupiah (+8.4% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equals 93%/91% of Stockbit/consensus estimates for FY24. Operationally, revenue in 3Q24 grew +11.9% QoQ and cost of revenue rose more moderately (+3.7% QoQ), causing the gross profit margin to increase to 37.5% (vs. 2Q24: 32.6%). Furthermore, operational expenses decreased by -7.3% QoQ, pushing operating profit growth higher (+35.5% QoQ). Quarter-over-quarter, NCKL's margin improvement was driven by: 1) higher limonite sales alongside the commencement of operations at the HPAL smelter owned by the company's subsidiary; and 2) an increase in ferronickel (FeNi) selling prices. Volume of Limonite Ore Sales Increased Along with the Operation of the Subsidiary's HPAL Smelter. The increase in limonite ore sales volume (+69.3% QoQ, +103.2% YoY) in 3Q24 was driven by the start of operations of the HPAL smelter owned by the company's subsidiary, PT Obi Nickel Cobalt, in August 2024. This sale is not eliminated because NCKL's ownership in PT Obi Nickel Cobalt is only 10%. FeNi Production Volume Stable with Margin Increasing QoQ. The production volume of FeNi nickel was relatively stable (-1.8% QoQ, +3.0% YoY) in 3Q24, with a sales volume increase (+2.5% QoQ, +3.6% YoY). The FeNi selling price was recorded at 11,921 US dollars per ton (+4.8% QoQ, -7.7% YoY), with a cash cost of 8,353 US dollars per ton (+3.7% QoQ, -9.8% YoY). NCKL Starts Electrolytic Cobalt Production Due to Higher Margin. In the earnings call today, Friday (22/11), NCKL management announced that the company has started producing electrolytic cobaltâ€”a derivative product of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP)â€”with a capacity of 6,000 tons per year, and exports began in August 2024. This product has a higher selling price, namely 22,047 US dollars per ton (vs. cobalt sulfate: 17,031 US dollars per ton) with a lower cash cost (8,308 US dollars per ton vs. cobalt sulfate: 9,020 US dollars per ton) as of 9M24. Electrolytic cobalt also has the same conversion ratio as the conversion ratio of MHP to cobalt sulfate. Key Takeaway. NCKL management stated in today's earnings call that the company expects 4Q24 operational performance to be relatively stable compared to 3Q24. Therefore, we assess that the performance estimates for NCKL in FY24 and FY25 need to be revised upwards. In today's trading, NCKL's stock price strengthened +3.09% to 835 rupiah per share. Based on existing performance estimates, NCKL is currently trading at a valuation of 8.02x P/E (1-Year Forward), below the historical average of 8.4x.",
