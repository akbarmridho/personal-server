      "title": "DEWA Adds Debt Conversion at Rp75 per Share",
      "content": "DEWA announced a private placement of approximately 3.95 million new shares at a price of 75 rupiah per share to convert debt of about 296.6 billion rupiah to PT Antareja Mahada Makmur. PT Antareja Mahada Makmur is a leasing and hire-purchase company and a creditor of DEWA's business debt amounting to 296.6 billion rupiah. After the transaction, PT Antareja Mahada Makmur will own 9.7% of DEWA, up from zero. This corporate action is part of a private placement plan recently announced by DEWA. Previously, DEWA also planned a private placement of about 14.9 million new shares at 75 rupiah per share to convert debt to PT Madhani Talatah Nusantara and PT Andhesti Tungkas Pratama. Cumulatively, the three private placements total about 18.8 million new shares. DEWA will hold a shareholders' meeting on 13 February 2025 to seek approval for the corporate action. DEWA shares closed up 8.74% at 112 rupiah per share on Tuesday (11/2). The conversion could generate short-term negative sentiment because the execution price is 33% lower than the current share price and could dilute existing shareholders by about 46.3%, reducing public ownership from 71% to 38.2% after the transaction. Financially, converting debt of roughly 1.4 trillion rupiah could lower DEWA's liability-to-equity ratio from 1.32x to 0.62x. Although the conversion is not the most optimal way to strengthen capital structure, it may have a positive long-term impact if new shareholders add value to the company.",

ASII's market share rose to 55.8% in January 2025 (vs. 54.5% in January 2024 and 52.8% in December 2024). The wholesale sales were mainly driven by Toyota and Lexus sales of 22,132 units (+4.8% YoY, -17.5% MoM), while Daihatsu sales fell to 9,983 units (-31% YoY, -24% MoM). SCMA: Controlling shareholder Surya Citra Media, through Elang Mahkota Teknologi (EMTK), bought about 102.7 million SCMA shares at an average price of 196.4 rupiah per share between 5-10 February 2025, totaling roughly 20.2 billion rupiah.

The loss of profit for the full year 2024 fell to 3 trillion rupiah, a 14% YoY decline, matching 97% of consensus estimates. Net interest income (NII) fell to 2.8 trillion rupiah in 4Q24 (-19% YoY, -1.9% QoQ), leading to a full-year NII of 11.7 trillion rupiah (-14% YoY). Net interest margin (NIM) for 2024 dropped to 2.9% from 3.8% in 2023, the lowest in a decade. Operating expenses rose 12% YoY in 2024, while loan loss provisions fell 46% YoY. Credit growth in 2024 was only 7.3% YoY, below the management guidance of 10-11% YoY. BREN: Barito Renewables Energy's President Hendra Tan announced that Star Energy Geothermal completed the Salak Binary geothermal power plant, adding 15.5 MW of capacity and raising the company's total geothermal capacity to 901.5 MW. SIDO: Sido Muncul CEO David Hidayat bought 3.65 million SIDO shares at an average price of 562 rupiah per share between 7-10 February 2025, worth about 2.05 billion rupiah.

WINS allocated US$20 million capex for 2025, down from US$35 million in 2024. Previously, WINS targeted fleet utilization of 75% in 2025 versus 68% in 2024. PYFA: Pyridam Farma's Chief Commercial Officer Antes Eko Prasetio stated the company will accelerate commercial development outside prescription drugs, focusing on consumer healthcare and beauty products in 2025 through Pyfahealth and Pyfabeauty, as part of a medium- to long-term strategy. Gold futures rose 0.03% to $2,935.3 per troy ounce on Tuesday (11/2) after briefly reaching $2,968.5 and hitting an intraday all-time high. The rise continued a 1.62% gain from Monday night. The increase followed U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States effective 12 March 2025, with further retaliatory tariffs to be announced later in the week, raising concerns of trade war escalation and higher inflation. The House of Representatives leadership asked all commission heads to postpone budget-efficiency meetings due to a government budget reconstruction, as per a letter signed by Deputy Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad. Commission VII Chair Saleh Partaonan Daulay confirmed the postponement of a meeting with the Ministry of Industry scheduled for Monday (10/2). Previously, President Prabowo Subianto announced a budget cut for the 2025 state budget to 306.7 trillion rupiah. Commodity analyst Kpler reported Vietnam's thermal coal imports grew 31% YoY to 44 million tonnes in 2024, making Vietnam a key driver of global coal import growth, which was only 1% YoY. The increase is driven by electricity demand for Vietnam's manufacturing sector, with steam-power plant capacity expected to rise 15% after projects are completed. Global Energy Monitor estimates Vietnam's installed power capacity at about 70 GW, with coal-fired plants contributing 39%, and about 11.6 GW of new capacity under construction, including roughly 4 GW of new coal plants. Deputy State-Owned Enterprises Minister Kartika Wirjoatmodjo said the government aims to raise renewable energyâ€™s share to 70% of added electricity capacity in the 2025-2034 electricity supply plan (RUPTL), replacing the 2021-2030 plan that targeted 52% renewable share of 40.6 GW new capacity. The 2025-2034 plan targets 71 GW of new capacity, with renewables rising from about 12% to 35% of total national capacity by 2034. Planned additions include 17 GW solar, 16 GW hydro, 5 GW geothermal, 15 GW gas, and other sources, while still adding 5 GW of coal-fired capacity. The Chair of the Indonesian Ceramic Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, projected that the government's program to build 3 million houses per year could boost ceramic production utilization by 10-15% because each house requires 110-115 million square meters of tiles. Asaki reported utilization reached 73% in January 2025, up from 64% in 2024, and aims for 80-85% in 2025. Pefindo estimated corporate bond issuance in 2025 will range between 139.29 and 155.43 trillion rupiah, with a midpoint of 143.91 trillion rupiah. In January 2025, corporate bond issuance had already reached 8.6 trillion rupiah, up from 6 trillion rupiah in January 2024. Total issuance in 2024 was 149.7 trillion rupiah, a 15.84% YoY increase. OJK Chairman Mahendra Siregar said the capital market is expected to raise 220 trillion rupiah in 2025, lower than the 259.24 trillion rupiah raised in 2024, and the target will be reviewed regularly. The head of the Downstream Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency (BPH Migas), Erika Retnowati, announced plans to issue new regulations limiting the maximum volume of subsidized gasoline (solar) purchases, as the current limit of 60 liters for four-wheel vehicles, 80 liters for six-wheel vehicles, and 200 liters for vehicles with more than six wheels is considered excessive. The Chair of DPR Commission XI, Mukhamad Misbakhun, reported that the DPR and the Directorate General of Taxes have agreed to use two tax systems, Coretax and the old system, to address implementation issues.",
