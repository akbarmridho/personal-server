      "content": "Danantara CIO, Pandu Sjahrir, told Reuters on Thursday (2/10) that they will invest approximately 10 billion US dollars or ~165 trillion rupiah in the first 3 months of operations starting from October 2025. As much as 80% of these funds will be allocated for domestic investment, while the remainder is for foreign investment. Pandu explained that some of the initial projects to be funded by Danantara include a hajj village in Saudi Arabia, upstream energy projects with Pertamina, and waste-to-energy power plants, with some projects set to start operating by the end of this year. Previously, Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, stated on Tuesday (30/9) that they would launch 33 waste-to-energy power plant (PSEL) projects, 8 of which would be launched by the end of October 2025. Pandu added that Danantara is also seeking to increase liquidity in the IHSG, reaffirming his statement in April 2025 when he mentioned that Danantara was ready to be a liquidity provider for the Indonesian stock market. In the next 2 years, Pandu mentioned that Danantara will focus on energy resilience, food security, renewable energy, financial services, healthcare, real estate, and digital infrastructure. Stockbit previously wrote about some of Danantara's potential investments. Danantara itself has secured funding from various sources, including: 1) BUMN dividends estimated at 7 billion US dollars or ~116 trillion rupiah throughout 2025; 2) the issuance of patriot bonds amounting to 50 trillion rupiah for the energy transition sector and others; and 3) multi-currency loans up to 10 billion US dollars or ~165 trillion rupiah.",

      "content": "Reuters reported that the National Nuclear Energy Agency is still determining the extent of the area affected by Caesium-137 radioactive contamination, with 10 points in the Modern Cikande Industrial Estate found to have high levels of exposure. The spokesperson for the incident investigation team, Bara Hasibuan, told Reuters that they expect to know the total contaminated area by early next week. The contamination was first detected in shrimp sent to the US in August 2025 by a local company also based in the Modern Cikande Industrial Estate. After a thorough scan, the government stated that the radioactive contamination originated from a scrap metal factory named PT Peter Metal Technology. Reuters reported that the Modern Cikande Industrial Estate covers an area of 3,175 hectares and houses over 270 companies in various sectors, ranging from food processing to automotive components. The Ministry of Communication and Digital temporarily froze the electronic system provider registration mark (TDPSE) for TikTok Pte. Ltd. after the company refused to share complete data on live streaming activities during the national demonstration in late August 2025. TDPSE itself is an operating license for electronic system providers. The impact of the temporary license freeze on TikTok's operations in Indonesia is not yet known. The Minister of Trade, Budi Santoso, urged the European Union to remove countervailing duties on imports of several stainless steel products from Indonesia. This request came after the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday (2/10) stated that the steps taken by the European Union were inconsistent with the agreed provisions. The Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that his ministry plans to develop tobacco product industrial areas to encourage illegal cigarette producers to become legal. The government will discuss with current actors to determine the most appropriate and fair excise tariff mechanism for them. Purbaya mentioned that this step is aimed at tidying up the circulation of illegal cigarettes, while also opening opportunities for small business actors to operate legally and pay taxes. Although the government offers coaching and empowerment, Purbaya affirmed that the government will still impose sanctions if business actors fail to meet their tax payment obligations according to current regulations. The controller of Alam Sutera Realty ($ASRI), PT Manunggal Prime Development, was recorded purchasing approximately 147.85 million ASRI shares. This transaction was only recorded in KSEI data as of October 1, 2025, so the transaction value is unknown. After this transaction, PT Manunggal Prime Development's ownership in ASRI increased from 26.12% to 26.87%.",
