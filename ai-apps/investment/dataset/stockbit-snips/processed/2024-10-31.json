      "title": "INDF: Net Profit Driven by Currency Gains, Operations Still Solid",
      "content": "Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF) recorded a strong net profit of IDR 4.9 trillion (+224% YoY, +249% QoQ) in Q3 2024. This result lifted 9-month net profit to IDR 8.8 trillion (+24% YoY), surpassing expectations at 90%/94% of the Stockbit/Fox consensus for FY24. The strong Q3 net profit was driven by a currency gain of IDR 3.4 trillion as the rupiah appreciated against the US dollar from IDR 16,421 at the end of June 2024 to IDR 15,138 at the end of September 2024. The currency gain reversed the situation from the previous quarter, when INDF’s Q2 2024 net profit was hit by a currency loss.\n\nOperationally, operating profit grew in Q3 2024 to IDR 5.3 trillion (+8% YoY, +3% QoQ). This made 9-month operating profit IDR 16.3 trillion (+15% YoY), beating the estimate at 83%/73% of the Stockbit/Fox FY24 consensus, above the historical range of about 72%. The operating profit growth was driven by revenue growth and maintained profitability.\n\n- Revenue grew, driven by the ICBP and agribusiness segments. INDF revenue rose to IDR 29.6 trillion (+7% YoY, +12% QoQ) in Q3 2024, taking 9-month revenue to IDR 87 trillion (74%/75% of the FY24 consensus). The revenue increase was mainly from the consumer branded products segment under the main subsidiary Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur (ICBP), which posted IDR 18.8 trillion (+11% YoY, +9% QoQ) in Q3 2024 and IDR 55.6 trillion (+8% YoY) for the 9-month period. The agribusiness segment also posted solid quarterly revenue growth of +28% QoQ.\n\n- Profitability remained solid, supported by the agribusiness segment. INDF’s operating margin rose +27 basis points YoY to 17.7% in Q3 2024, despite a -149-basis-point QoQ decline, still above our estimate of 16.8% for FY24. By segment, the operating margin was supported by agribusiness, which posted an almost 2-fold increase to 22.4%/16.8% in Q3 2024/9M 2024. The strong agribusiness margin offset weaker margins in three other segments, each of which saw operating-margin declines. We estimate the agribusiness margin strength was due to a CPO price increase of about +6% in Q3 2024, while the ICBP margin weakness is estimated to be caused by a wheat price increase of about +6% in Q3 2024.\n\nKey Takeaway: In the previous quarter we noted that INDF’s 2H 2024 outlook could improve as the rupiah recovered against the US dollar, which is now reflected in Q3 2024 performance. Two main risks/opportunities for Q4 2024: (1) a weakening rupiah could generate a currency loss again – the rupiah is currently at 15,700 per US$ (about –4% versus the end of Q3 2024); (2) wheat and CPO prices that remain favorable could help sustain a higher FY24 margin – wheat in October 2024 stayed below US$6 per bushel (our assumption 6.20) supporting ICBP margin, while agribusiness margin could rise as CPO prices have risen about +15% in the last month to RM 4,700 per ton (our assumption RM 3,700).",

The result was supported by higher sales volume while Indonesian coal (ICI) prices were flat in Q3 2024. Gross margin was 37.1% in Q3 2024 (vs. 37.9% in Q2 2024) and 39.5% over 9M 2024 (vs. 39.9% in 9M 2023), also better than our FY24 estimate of 38.4%.

      "content": "Alam Sutera Realty (ASRI) posted a net loss of IDR 6 billion in Q3 2024 (vs. a profit of IDR 43 billion in Q3 2023 and a loss of IDR 23 billion in Q2 2024), pressured by a 28% YoY, 31% QoQ drop in revenue recognition and a 1% YoY, 45% QoQ rise in financial costs. Over 9M 2024, ASRI’s net loss widened 90% YoY, driven by a currency loss and other items totalling IDR 198 billion (vs. 9M23 profit IDR 30 billion). Revenue grew only 2% YoY in 9M 2024 as operating expenses rose 5%, causing operating-margin decline.",

      "content": "Cikarang Listrindo (POWR) posted a net profit of US$39 million (+92% YoY, +155% QoQ) in Q3 2024, resulting in a 9-month net profit of US$73 million (-5% YoY). The profit recovery was driven by a currency gain of US$4 million (vs. a loss of US$1 million in Q2 2024 and a loss of US$2 million in Q3 2023) and a reversal of a deferred tax charge of US$11.5 million (Q2 2024: US$5 million, Q3 2023: reversal of US$5 million). Operating profit fell (-3% YoY) but rose 21% QoQ in Q3 2024 due to a 23% YoY decline in electricity sales volume to PLN (181 GWh). The industrial segment saw a 3% YoY, 9% QoQ increase in electricity sales to 873 GWh in Q3 2024.",

      "title": "INDF: Net Profit Driven by Currency Gains, Operations Still Solid",
      "content": "Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF) reported a net profit of IDR 4.9 trillion (+224% YoY, +249% QoQ) in Q3 2024, lifting 9-month net profit to IDR 8.8 trillion (+24% YoY), equal to 90%/94% of the FY24 Stockbit/consensus estimate. The Q3 profit was driven by a currency gain of IDR 3.4 trillion as the rupiah appreciated from IDR 16,421 per USD at end-June 2024 to IDR 15,138 per USD at end-September 2024, reversing the previous quarter’s currency loss. Operating profit grew to IDR 5.3 trillion (+8% YoY, +3% QoQ), making 9-month operating profit IDR 16.3 trillion (+15% YoY) and beating the 83%/73% FY24 consensus, above the historical 72% range. Revenue rose to IDR 29.6 trillion (+7% YoY, +12% QoQ) in Q3 2024, taking 9-month revenue to IDR 87 trillion (74%/75% of the FY24 consensus). Revenue growth was led by the consumer-branded-products segment under the subsidiary Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur (ICBP), which posted IDR 18.8 trillion (+11% YoY, +9% QoQ) in Q3 2024 and IDR 55.6 trillion (+8% YoY) for 9M 2024. The agribusiness segment also posted a solid +28% QoQ revenue increase in Q3 2024. Operating-margin rose 27 bps YoY to 17.7% in Q3 2024, despite a 149-bps QoQ decline, still above our 16.8% FY24 estimate. Segment-level, agribusiness margin rose to 22.4%/16.8% in Q3 2024/9M 2024, offsetting margin weakness in three other segments, which suffered margin declines partly due to a +6% wheat price increase in Q3 2024. The key takeaway notes that a weaker rupiah could reverse gains, while wheat and CPO price dynamics could support higher FY24 margins; wheat stayed below US$6 per bushel in October 2024 (our assumption US$6.20) and CPO rose about +15% to RM 4,700/ton (our assumption RM 3,700).",
