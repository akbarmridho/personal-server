      "title": "Decline in Car Sales Starting to Flatten",
      "content": "Car wholesales in Indonesia in May 2024 were recorded at 71,263 units, increasing by +46.5% MoM but decreasing by -13.3% YoY. Cumulatively over 5M24, car wholesales in Indonesia only reached 334,897 units (-21% YoY), fulfilling only 30.4% of the 2024 target set by Gaikindo at 1.1 million units.\nIn May 2024, Astra International recorded car wholesales of 40,876 units, up +54.1% MoM but down -12.5% YoY. This result brought ASII's sales over 5M24 to 187,446 units, down -19.1% YoY. The lower YoY drop in ASII's sales compared to its competitors—both in May 2024 and 5M24—caused ASII's market share to rise compared to last year. Based on its brands, Daihatsu was the mainstay of ASII's sales with a much more moderate decline compared to Toyota+Lexus.\nMeanwhile, sales from ASII's competitors experienced a deeper decline, with total non-ASII brand sales in May 2024 reaching 30,387 units (+37.5% MoM, -14.4% YoY). Cumulatively, total non-ASII brand sales in 5M24 reached 147,451 units, down -23.3% YoY. Wuling experienced an increase in market share during 5M24, while Honda and Hyundai experienced declines throughout this year.\nAfter the release of car wholesale sales data for the May 2024 period, Gaikindo still maintains the sales target at the level of 1.1 million units.\nKey Takeaway\nAlthough the car wholesale sales figures appear difficult to meet the target set by Gaikindo, we assess that signs of improvement are beginning to appear. This is reflected in the sales decline starting to flatten, from levels around -20% YoY in previous months to around -10% YoY in May 2024.\nTherefore, monthly car wholesale sales need to be monitored by investors. Given that ASII's valuation is already at a low level (1-Year Forward P/E 6x, P/BV 0.85x), signals of further recovery in car sales have the potential to be responded to positively by market players.",

President Joko Widodo's comments contrast with the stance of the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, who in April 2024 requested that State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) postpone large dollar purchases to reduce pressure on rupiah depreciation. Since the beginning of the year, the rupiah has depreciated by -5.5% YTD to the level of 16,295 per US dollar as of Tuesday (11/6).",
