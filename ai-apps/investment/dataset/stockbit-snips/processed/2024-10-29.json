      "content": "Mayora Indah recorded a low net profit for 3Q24 of 298 billion rupiah (down 63 percent year over year, down 51 percent quarter over quarter). This result kept the net profit for the first nine months of 2024 relatively stable at 2 trillion rupiah (down 1 percent YoY). We assess the achievement as below expectations because it equals only 60 percent of the FY24 consensus net profit estimate. By comparison, Mayora's net profit for 9M23 was 63 percent of FY23 net profit. Currency loss due to rupiah strengthening: Net profit for 3Q24 was also pressured by a net foreign exchange loss of 257 billion rupiah (3Q23: profit 33 billion rupiah, 2Q24: profit 98 billion rupiah). This was caused by the rupiah strengthening against the US dollar to about 15,100 per dollar at the end of September 2024. Mayora holds net cash in US dollars of about 280 million dollars at the end of September 2024, so the company will incur a currency loss when the US dollar weakens against the rupiah. Operating profit pressure from lower gross margin and higher opex: Operating profit was recorded at 726 billion rupiah in 3Q24 (down 31 percent YoY, up 5 percent QoQ). This made operating profit for 9M24 2.7 trillion rupiah (down 2 percent YoY), slightly below expectations at 63 percent of the FY24 consensus estimate (vs. 9M23: 65 percent of FY23). The weak operating profit in 3Q24 was mainly caused by: 1) continued pressure on cocoa and coffee raw material prices affecting gross margin; and 2) increased opex. Gross margin fell to 20.5 percent in 3Q24 (vs. 3Q23: 26.9 percent, 2Q24: 23.5 percent), marking a decline for two consecutive quarters. This pushed the gross margin for 9M24 down to 23.9 percent (vs. 9M23: 26.7 percent), raising the risk that FY24 gross margin will be below management guidance that targets a minimum of 25 percent. With continued pressure on gross margin, Mayora is likely to execute a plan to raise product selling prices for the remainder of the year. Management will hold an earnings call on 5 November 2024, focusing on the company's gross margin dynamics. We consider gross margin the main issue for Mayora, as revenue grew solidly to 9.4 trillion rupiah in 3Q24 (up 17 percent YoY, up 26 percent QoQ). This growth lifted 9M24 revenue by 12 percent YoY to 25.6 trillion rupiah, in line with the new guidance of 10-12 percent growth. Meanwhile, opex increased, especially in general and administrative expenses (up 29 percent YoY, up 15 percent QoQ) together with a surge in salary expenses (up 21 percent YoY, up 17 percent QoQ). We anticipate this cost increase is related to the opening of two new factories. Key Takeaway: Although Mayora may reverse its currency loss in 4Q24 as the US dollar weakens, we view the company's ability to address gross margin challenges as the key factor for its stock movement, given that cocoa and chocolate raw material prices remain relatively high.",
