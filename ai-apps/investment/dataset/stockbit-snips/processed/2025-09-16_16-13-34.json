      "title": "Government Releases 4Q25 Economic Stimulus Package Valued at IDR 16.2 Trillion",
      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Monday (15/9) that the government will issue an economic stimulus package worth approximately 16.2 trillion Rupiah in 4Q25. This is the third stimulus in 2025, following the first stimulus (~33 trillion Rupiah) in January-February 2025 and the second stimulus (~24.4 trillion Rupiah) in June-July 2025.\n\nThe latest stimulus package consists of 8 programs that will generally apply for the remainder of 2025, namely: 1) university graduate internship programs; 2) expansion of government-borne PPh 21 (DTP) for tourism sector workers; 3) food aid; 4) job accident and death insurance contribution assistance for non-wage earners such as online motorcycle taxi partners; 5) BPJS Ketenagakerjaan additional service benefit programs for housing; 6) cash for work programs; 7) acceleration of the deregulation of Government Regulation No. 28; and 8) urban pilot projects in large cities to improve settlement quality and provision of space for the gig economy.\n\nSeveral programs noted by us include:\n- Food Aid (7 trillion Rupiah) - Allocated for 18.3 million beneficiary families (KPM) in the form of 10 kilograms of rice per month for October and November, with an option for extension until December 2025 if budget realization is not optimal. This aid comes shortly after reports of premium rice scarcity and rising rice prices.\n- Cash for Work (5.7 trillion Rupiah) - Allocated for 609,465 beneficiaries in the form of daily wages for projects under the Ministry of Transportation (1.8 trillion Rupiah) and the Ministry of Public Works (3.5 trillion Rupiah) for the September-December 2025 period. Previously, a similar program was implemented in 2018.\n- PPh 21 DTP Incentive for Tourism Sector (120 billion Rupiah) - Allocated for 552,000 workers in the tourism, hotel, restaurant, and cafe (Horeca) sectors. Previously, in the first stimulus, the government only provided PPh 21 incentives for workers in labor-intensive sectors.\n\nBesides programs for the remainder of 2025, Airlangga also announced that the government will continue 4 incentive programs next year. These incentives include: 1) 0.5% final income tax for MSME individual taxpayers, extended until 2029; 2) PPh 21 DTP for tourism sector workers with salaries up to 10 million per month; 3) PPh 21 DTP for labor-intensive sector workers with salaries up to 10 million per month; and 4) discounts on job accident and death insurance contributions for non-wage earners such as online motorcycle taxi partners.\n\nRegarding the 0.5% final income tax incentive for MSMEs, previously the government only extended this policy for 1 year, which is for 2025, for MSME actors who have fully utilized this incentive (7 years).",

      "content": "Deputy Chairman of Commission XI of the House of Representatives from the PKB Faction, Hanif Dhakiri, asked the government not to increase the Tobacco Product Excise Duty (CHT) and suggested the government take innovative steps to meet the rising excise tax deposit target in 2026, one of which is by eradicating illegal cigarettes. Responding to this request, Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, confirmed that he will review the cigarette excise policy further because as of now there is no decision on whether the cigarette excise rate will rise, remain the same, or decrease. Purbaya also stated that the government is calculating the potential additional state revenue from eradicating illegal excise duties, which will form the basis for future cigarette excise policies.\n\nMinister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, opened up the opportunity for the transfer of more than 10% of the shares in PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) from Freeport-McMoran to the government. Bahlil explained that this target is the result of the latest negotiations, after previously only a 10% increase was agreed upon. This statement was supported by the CEO of BPI Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, who conveyed that the government plans to increase its shareholding in PTFI by 12%. This plan is targeted to be completed soon, awaiting the approval of President Prabowo Subianto. The government is also striving for the share transfer to occur at a low price, considering the thinning valuation of PTFI's assets. This increase in government shares is a condition for the extension of PTFI's IUPK, which is scheduled to expire in 2041. Currently, the share ownership composition of PTFI consists of the Indonesian government through MIND ID (51%) and Freeport-McMoran (49%).\n\nCoordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that the Housing KUR worth 130 trillion Rupiah will be launched through Himbara banks this year. Of this amount, 117 trillion Rupiah will be focused on supporting MSME developers with a ceiling of up to 20 billion Rupiah, while the remaining 13 trillion Rupiah will be allocated to the demand side covering house renovations. The government will provide an interest subsidy of 5% for MSME developers with a maximum tenor of 4 years for working capital loans and a maximum of 5 years for investment loans. Airlangga also added that the Housing KUR program is confirmed to have a budget allocation until 2026.\n\nNon-Independent Commissioner of Nusa Raya Cipta (NRCA), Johannes Suriadjaja, sold 2 million NRCA shares at an average price of approximately 1,070 Rupiah per share on September 10, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 2.1 billion Rupiah. After this transaction, Johannes Suriadjaja's direct ownership portion in NRCA decreased from 0.08% to none.",
