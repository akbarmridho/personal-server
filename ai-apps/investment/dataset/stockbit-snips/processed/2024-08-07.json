      "content": "Director of the Center of Reform on Economics Indonesia, Mohammad Faisal, told Kompas that household consumption growth (+4.93% YoY) was lower than Indonesia's overall economic growth (+5.05% YoY) in 2Q24, due to a decline in purchasing power of the middle class. He warned that the government should be cautious about policies that could further pressure the middle class, such as the proposed increase of VAT to 12% and the expansion of excise objects. Meanwhile, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto assessed that the 2Q24 household consumption result was fairly high.",

The revision was caused by weak domestic motorcycle sales in 1H24, which fell 0.97% YoY to 3.17 million units. Kumala explained that the decline was pressured by weaker purchasing power of consumers amid a spike in food inflation and a still‑high policy interest rate.",

Operating profit grew 12% YoY and 0.3% QoQ, lifting 1H24 operating profit by 34% YoY, also above the consensus at 53% of the FY24 estimate. Mobile subscriber base grew to 58.5 million (+1% YoY, +2% QoQ) in 2Q24; average revenue per mobile subscriber (ARPU) held at IDR 44,000 (+5% YoY, 0% QoQ) despite lower marketing and G&A expenses, which improved profit margins. Management said the subscriber and ARPU growth stemmed from network‑quality investments in low‑share‑of‑market cities, and expects marketing spend to rise in 2H24 due to seasonality and competition. The company also aims to become a market leader in ARPU through a payment‑app integration strategy. No upgrade to FY24 guidance was given; the company kept its FY24 outlook of high single‑digit revenue growth, ~50% EBITDA margin and IDR 8 trillion capex, citing ongoing competition uncertainty. The FY24 financials do not yet reflect the integration of Link Net (LINK) revenue and profit, as the timeline remains uncertain.",
