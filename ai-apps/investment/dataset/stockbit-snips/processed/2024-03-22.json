      "title": "Government Plans to Merge 7 BUMN Karya into 3 Entities",
      "content": "The Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN), led by Minister Erick Thohir, announced that the government plans to reduce the number of BUMN Karya from seven companies to three through a consolidation, a move that is part of the financial health improvement of BUMN Karya that has been discussed since 2023. The surviving entities after the merger will be Adhi Karya (ADHI), PT PP (PTPP), and PT Hutama Karya. The merged entities will focus on their respective business lines: • PT Hutama Karya together with Waskita Karya (WSKT) will handle toll and non‑toll road projects, institutional buildings and residential‑commercial projects. • PT PP together with Wijaya Karya (WIKA) will handle airport, seaport projects and the remaining residential projects. • ADHI, PT Nindya Karya and PT Brantas Abipraya will handle water‑related construction and railway infrastructure. The ministry has coordinated with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing and the Ministry of Finance to push the consolidation, which is expected to be completed by October 2024 or before the minister’s term ends. The financial health of BUMN Karya has been under scrutiny, with WSKT reporting a debt‑to‑equity ratio (DER) of 9.88× (9M 2023), WIKA 4.52× (9M 2023), PTPP 1.55× (FY 2023) and ADHI 1.37× (FY 2023). In February 2024, WIKA and 15 creditors signed a master restructuring agreement (MRA) worth IDR 24.79 trillion. The consolidation is expected to strengthen capital structures, reduce competition and increase specialization, potentially improving profitability. However, the potential merger of PTPP and WIKA could generate short‑term negative sentiment for PTPP because PTPP’s financial health and profitability are currently stronger than WIKA’s. On Friday (22 Mar), PTPP fell 2.78 %, ADHI was unchanged, while WIKA and WSKT were under trading suspension.",
