      "title": "Oil, Gold, and CPO Prices Rise Together",
      "content": "Prices of several commodities have risen in the past few days. Oil and gold increased during Monday (2/6) night trading while crude palm oil (CPO) rose during Tuesday (3/6) trading. Below is a summary of the price movements of the three commodities:\n\nOil\nBrent futures for the August 2025 contract closed up +2.4% at USD 63.9 per barrel on Monday (2/6) followed by a +1.2% rise to USD 64.7 per barrel on Tuesday (3/6). The price increase responded to two developments: 1) the stable production increase decision by OPEC+ and 2) a decline in the number of rigs in the United States and disrupted supply in Canada.\n\nOPEC+ on Saturday (31/5) decided to maintain the July 2025 production increase of 411,000 barrels per day. This is the third consecutive month that OPEC+ has raised oil production by the same amount, easing market expectations of a more aggressive increase. In addition, the United States reported that the rig count continued to fall throughout May 2025, reaching its lowest level since 2021. Meanwhile, Reuters estimated that 7% of oil production in Canada was affected by forest fires in the province of Alberta.\n\nBrent oil has experienced a -13.5% year-to-date decline as of Tuesday (3/6), driven mainly by the OPEC+ production increase that exceeded initial expectations and weaker demand amid a slowing global economic growth outlook due to trade wars.\n\nGold\nSpot gold rose +3.1% to USD 3,392 per troy ounce on Monday (2/6), reaching a three-week high, before falling -0.9% and closing at USD 3,357 per troy ounce on Tuesday (3/6). The increase occurred alongside growing investor concerns over global uncertainty and a weakening US dollar index (DXY).\n\nThe US plan to raise import tariffs on steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%, together with the Ukraine attack on Russia last weekend, heightened investor anxiety. The DXY closed down -0.7% to 98.7 on Monday (2/6).\n\nGold has risen +28% year-to-date as of Tuesday (3/6) and briefly hit an all-time high of USD 3,500 per troy ounce in April (22/4). The YTD gain is mainly driven by trade tensions that push investors toward safe-haven assets. The DXY has weakened -9.6% year-to-date as of Tuesday (3/6).\n\nCPO\nCPO futures for the August 2025 contract rose +2.6% to IDR 3,977 per ton before closing up +1.4% at IDR 3,934 per ton on Tuesday (3/6). The increase followed the Indian governmentâ€™s decision to cut the basic import tariff on crude vegetable oils from 20% to 10% on Friday (30/5).\n\nThe policy aims to lower domestic food prices while supporting the local refining industry.\n\nWith the adjustment, the total import tariff for crude vegetable oil fell from 27.5% to 16.5%, considering additional levies beyond the basic tariff. The tariff for processed vegetable oil remains unchanged, widening the tariff gap between crude and processed oils and encouraging importers to shift to crude oil imports.\n\nCPO has declined -13.2% year-to-date as of Tuesday (3/6), mainly due to reduced demand from India. Indian CPO imports even fell to a 14-year low in January 2025.\n\nKey Takeaway\nThe price increases of the three commodities provide positive sentiment for related issuers: 1) oil and gas producers (MEDC, ENRG, RATU); 2) gold producers (ANTM, ARCI, PSAB, BRMS); and 3) CPO producers (TAPG, LSIP, DSNG).",
