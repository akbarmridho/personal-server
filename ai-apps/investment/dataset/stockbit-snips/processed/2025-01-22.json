      "title": "BBNI FY24: Net Profit +2.7% YoY, Below Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) reported a net profit of 5.2 trillion rupiah for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 8.2 percent quarter-on-quarter and unchanged year-on-year. This resulted in a full-year 2024 net profit of 21.5 trillion rupiah, a growth of 2.7 percent year-on-year, slightly below expectations at 97.2 percent of the consensus FY24 forecast. The positive performance was driven by (1) a solid Net Interest Margin (NIM); (2) controlled credit cost (CoC) and stable asset quality; and (3) strong loan growth despite liquidity challenges. NIM for the bank only rose to 4.5 percent in Q4 2024, putting the FY24 average at 4.2 percent, above the FY24 guidance of over 4 percent. The increase was supported by Rural Business Credit (KUR) lending; excluding KUR, core NIM was 4.2 percent in Q4. Loan yield for the bank only rose about 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter, while cost of funds rose 5 basis points due to higher CASA and deposit rates. Management targets a FY25 NIM of 4-4.2 percent, expecting weakness in the first half of 2025 before improvement in the second half, based on tighter liquidity projections for H1 2025. Credit cost (CoC) for the bank only expanded to 1.5 percent in Q4 2024, though it remained at 1.1 percent for the full year, aligning with the FY24 guidance of plus or minus 1 percent. The increase was caused by additional provisions for the Sri Rejeki Isman group (SRIL) and a conservative approach to the micro-SME segment. Asset quality improved, with Loan at Risk (LAR) falling to 10.3 percent and gross non-performing loans staying at 2 percent. Management targets a FY25 CoC of around plus or minus 1 percent. Loan growth for FY24 was 11.6 percent year-on-year, matching the FY24 guidance range of 10-12 percent, driven by a 17.6 percent increase in corporate loans while the KUR segment contracted 25 percent year-on-year. Liquidity tightened, with the loan-to-deposit ratio rising to 96.1 percent in FY24 from 85.8 percent in FY23. Despite a reduction in the Bank Indonesia policy rate, liquidity challenges persist, but management expects improvement through (1) CASA growth via the Wondr app; (2) the latest DHE SDA revision; and (3) higher mandatory giro balances. Credit growth for FY25 is targeted at 8-10 percent, below the Bank Indonesia banking sector target of 11-13 percent. The dividend payout ratio for FY24 is planned at 50-60 percent, implying a dividend yield of 6-7.2 percent based on the Wednesday (22/1) closing price of 4,790 rupiah per share.",
