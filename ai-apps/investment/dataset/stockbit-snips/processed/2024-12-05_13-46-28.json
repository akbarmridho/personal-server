      "title": "AADI: ARA on Listing Day, PUPS Exercise Starts December 6",
      "content": "Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI) officially listed on the IDX today, Thursday (5/12). Amidst the buzz regarding short-term trading opportunities from the AADI IPO, we assess that investors can also consider fundamental factors for long-term investment in AADI, especially from the dividend yield aspect. \n- Valuation Potentially Re-rated to 5-7x P/E We project AADI's net profit in FY25F to drop to 934 million USD (-27.5% YoY) due to the loss of one-off gain from subsidiary sales, with core profit only declining by -3.2% YoY. However, given its low IPO valuation (2.9x P/E FY25F), we see AADI having significant upside potential with a re-rating opportunity to 5x P/E FY25F (9,650 rupiah per share, +74% from the IPO price). We consider the AADI valuation at 5x P/E to be reasonable and conservative because it is lower than the 5-year historical average P/E of its parent company, Alamtri Resources Indonesia ($ADRO), at 6.9x P/E. This valuation is also between Bukit Asam ($PTBA) at 7.3x P/E FY25F and Indo Tambangraya Megah ($ITMG) at 4.8x P/E FY25F. If AADI can re-rate to ADRO's 5-year historical average P/E (6.9x) and become similar to PTBA's valuation at ~7x PE, this implies a price of 13,525 rupiah per share (+144% from the IPO price). \n- Dividend Yield up to ~17% with 50% DPR Assumption Besides the expectation that the Newcastle coal price outlook will not drop significantly, we see AADI's potential for re-rating will also be driven by the dividend prospect for the 2025 fiscal year, which we project can reach ~966 rupiah per share. This amount indicates a dividend yield of ~17% based on the AADI share price at IPO (5,550 rupiah per share). This dividend size assumes a dividend payout ratio (DPR) of 50%, which is the average DPR of ADRO in the last 3 years. This dividend yield is higher compared to other large coal companies, such as ITMG and PTBA. Although management stated in the prospectus that they plan to distribute dividends with a DPR of up to 45%, we assess that the assumption of a 50% DPR is not aggressive considering the company currently has no major capex plans in the near future. With a 50% DPR and the level of net profit generated by the company, we also believe AADI still has sufficient funds should it decide at any time to develop its 2 coal mines, namely Pari Coal and Ratah Coal. \n- Main Assumptions in Our Analysis\n  - Average Newcastle coal price of 135 USD per ton in 2024 and 130 USD per ton in 2025, reflecting normalization from the current level of 134.8 USD per ton. \n  - Sales volume of 63 million tons in 2024 (-0.6% YoY) and 64 million tons in 2025 (+1.6% YoY). \n  - Cash costs of 56.2 USD per ton in 2024 (-12% YoY) and 57.8 USD per ton in 2025 (+2.9% YoY). \n  - Non-operational income significantly decreased in 2025 (-89.4% YoY) due to the loss of one-off gain from asset disposal. \n\nKey Takeaway\nAlthough it seems many investors bought AADI based on short-term trading opportunities, we see AADI could be a good fundamental investment opportunity, especially with a relatively stable coal outlook and significant recurring dividend yield. Starting Friday (6/12) until Tuesday (10/12) at 10.00 AM Western Indonesia Time, investors entitled to exercise AADI PUPS ([$ADRO-H](-H)) can exercise on the Stockbit application. The dividend that can be used to exercise ADRO-H will be credited on Friday (6/12). \nWith AADI increasing by +19.8% to the level of 6,650 rupiah per share today (5/12), the exercise price is 5,971 rupiah per share (including 0.18% transaction fees charged based on the PUPS prospectus). \n\nHere is how to exercise ADRO-H on Stockbit:\n1. Swipe right on ADRO-H on the Portfolio page, then click Exercise. \n2. Enter the amount of ADRO-H you want to exercise. Then click Exercise.",
