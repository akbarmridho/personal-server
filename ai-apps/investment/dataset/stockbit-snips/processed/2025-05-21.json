      "title": "BI Cuts Interest Rate, Downgrades Credit and Economic Growth Targets",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to lower the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.5% on Wednesday (21/5), with the deposit facility and lending facility also each falling by 25 basis points to 4.75% and 6.25% respectively. The decision matches consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the move aims to support domestic economic growth that is beginning to slow. Bank Indonesia also reduced its 2025 economic growth target from +4.7-5.5% to +4.6-5.4%, marking a downgrade of the outlook for this year. As context, Indonesia's actual GDP growth in 1Q25 was only +4.87% YoY, below the government target of +5.2% YoY and the weakest since 3Q21. The central bank also cut its credit growth target from a range of +11-13% YoY to about +8-11% YoY. This follows a slowdown in bank credit growth in 4M25, which grew only +8.88% YoY (versus +9.16% YoY in 1Q25) due to weaker demand and tighter liquidity. Credit growth in 4M25 was the weakest since 7M23. In addition to cutting rates, Bank Indonesia announced it will lower the macro-prudential liquidity ratio for conventional and sharia banks by 100 basis points to 4% and 2.5% respectively. The foreign funding ratio for banks will be raised by 5 percentage points to a maximum of 35% of bank capital. Both measures will take effect on 1 June 2025. Bank Indonesia expects the US Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50 basis points by the end of 2025 as inflation prospects ease following a de-escalation of the trade war. This expectation aligns with consensus, as the CME FedWatch Tool today projects a Fed rate cut of at least 50 basis points by the end of 2025 with a 72.1% probability. Perry emphasized that Indonesia's inflation outlook remains within the 1.5-3.5% YoY target band. To maintain rupiah stability, Bank Indonesia will continue foreign exchange and bond market interventions and optimise instruments such as SRBI, SVBI, and SUVBI. Following the BI Rate cut announcement, the Jakarta Composite Index closed up 0.67% and the rupiah strengthened 0.12% to 16,383 per US dollar, while the 10-year government bond yield fell 23 basis points to 6.828%. Key Takeaway: We assess that Bank Indonesia has room to continue rate cuts as the rupiah strengthens and US rate-cut prospects improve. Consensus now expects another 25-basis-point BI Rate cut by the end of 2025, based on Bloomberg and Reuters surveys. We recommend investors stay invested, especially in sectors sensitive to monetary easing such as banking ($BBCA, $BBRI, $BMRI, $BBNI) and property ($SMRA, $CTRA, $PWON, $BSDE). Investors should also watch US producer price inflation data and the Fed meeting for further clues on Bank Indonesia's rate-cut path.",

      "content": "1. Bank Indonesia recorded that bank credit growth slowed to +8.88% YoY in 4M25 (vs. +9.16% YoY in 1Q25), below the 2025 target range of +11-13% YoY and marking the weakest growth since July 2023. With this development, Bank Indonesia projects 2025 bank credit growth to be in the +8-11% YoY range. Investment credit grew +15.86% YoY, consumer credit +8.97% YoY, and working-capital credit +4.62% YoY during 4M25. Sharia financing grew +8.85% YoY and MSME credit grew +2.6% YoY. 2. CNN reported that the US government has received intelligence about a possible Israeli plan to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, amid US diplomatic efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran. An anonymous US official told CNN that it is unclear whether Israel has made a final decision and whether the plan reflects disagreement with the US on the nuclear deal. 3. Chinese customs recorded gold imports of 127.5 tons in April 2025, a 73% month-on-month increase, the highest in 11 months despite all-time-high gold prices. Bloomberg said the surge may be driven by the People’s Bank of China allocating new quotas to commercial banks in April 2025, responding to strong demand from institutional and retail investors during a peak trade war. 4. Indonesia’s coal exports to China fell 20% YoY in April 2025 to 14.286 million tons, according to Chinese customs data. This caused Indonesia’s coal exports to China in 4M25 to decline 5% YoY to about 66.9 million tons. Reuters reported the drop was linked to Chinese importers refusing to use the Coal Benchmark Price (HBA) as a reference, and low domestic coal prices in China, which hit a four-year low, also pressured imports, leading to a 16% YoY decline in total Chinese coal imports in April 2025. 5. SKK Migas head Djoko Siswanto claimed on Tuesday (20/5) that Chevron, TotalEnergies, and Shell will resume upstream investment in Indonesia, and that 22 other companies have expressed interest in exploring domestic hydrocarbon basins. The government will auction 60 oil-gas work areas up to 2028, focusing on under-developed eastern Indonesia. 6. BPI Danantara COO Dony Oskaria said on Tuesday (20/5) that the firm plans to reduce the number of state-owned enterprises and subsidiaries from around 800 to about 200, with a review targeted for completion by October 2025. The consolidation aims to make the remaining 200 entities competitive and globally oriented. 7. Kompas reported that the DPR plans to draft new regulations specifically governing online transportation, separate from Law No. 22/2009 on traffic and road transport, to address ongoing issues raised by roughly 7 million online-motorcycle-taxi drivers. On Wednesday (21/5), Komisi V DPR held a hearing with online-driver representatives as part of the drafting process. 8. Bank DKI President Director Agus H. Widodo said on Tuesday (20/5) that the bank has obtained permission from OJK and the DKI Jakarta provincial government to conduct an IPO, though he did not specify the timing. 9. Technology firm Karya Digital Nusa ($TRON) plans a rights issue of about 384 million new shares, resulting in a dilution of up to 11.5%; the issue price has not been disclosed and the proceeds will be used to strengthen capital structure and increase share liquidity. In addition, TRON announced plans to expand its business into electricity sales. Both proposals will be discussed at the extraordinary shareholders meeting on 26 June 2025.",
