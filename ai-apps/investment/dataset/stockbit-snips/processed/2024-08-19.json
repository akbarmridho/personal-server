      "content": "Indonesia's Ministry of Finance held a press conference on the 2025 State Budget Financial Note on Friday (16 August). Key market indices: IHSG 7,467 (+0.47%); Coal 150.5 (+0.83%); Oil (Brent) 79.0 (-0.81%); Gold 2,540 (+0.04%); CPO 3,722 (+1.11%); Nickel 16,373 (+0.33%).\n- Subsidy budget increased, positive for consumption. The energy subsidy and compensation budget rose by 18% to 394 trillion rupiah, with the highest increase recorded in electricity subsidy and energy compensation. This increase, higher than the assumed exchange rate weakening, reflects the government's intent to preserve consumer purchasing power amid a projected global economic slowdown in 2025. Non‑energy subsidies and their reserves also rose significantly (+36%), driven in part by an increase in fertilizer subsidy quota from 6‑7 million tons to 9 million tons in 2025.\n- Nutrition‑free meal program budget included in RAPBN 2025 at 71 trillion rupiah, targeting about 20 million students in under‑developed areas, with an initial capex of around 20 trillion rupiah, implying an expenditure of roughly 10,000 rupiah per child per day. The government estimates this program will add 0.1 percentage point to economic growth in 2025.\n- IKN (new capital city) budget only 143 billion rupiah (2024: 43 trillion rupiah), still a baseline figure that can be increased by the next administration.",

The MBDK excise target for the 2024 State Budget was 4.4 trillion rupiah, but it has not been implemented yet because technical regulations have not been released. Qualitatively, the negative impact on consumer company profitability can be minimized because companies can launch lower‑sugar products and pass on part of the tax to prices. Mayora Indah ($MYOR), which has 25‑30% of its revenue exposed to MBDK tax, is expected to feel the greatest impact, followed by Jamu and Pharmaceutical company Sido Muncul ($SIDO) with about 15‑20% revenue exposure.",
