This resulted in a 2024 net profit of 58 million US dollars (down 78.9% YoY), below expectations as it met only 87.7%/82.5% of the Stockbit/consensus estimate. Although 4Q24 revenue grew 5.2% QoQ, net profit fell mainly due to a 111.4% QoQ increase in operating expenses and other income turning into a loss of 4 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24 profit of 12 million US dollars).\\n\\n- Increase in operating expenses and reversal of other income\\nThe rise in operating expenses was driven by higher costs across all expense categories, which we estimate are related to the opening of new pits at Pomalaa and Bahodopi. The reversal of other income was mainly caused by the change from a gain on fair value accounting of derivative assets (related to additional participation rights in the HPAL smelter project) to a loss of 10 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24 gain of 9 million US dollars).\\n\\n- Potential increase in nickel matte production and sales\\nINCO produced 18,528 tonnes of nickel matte in 4Q24 (up 2.9% QoQ), bringing total 2024 nickel matte production to 71,311 tonnes (up 0.8% YoY), slightly above the target of 70,805 tonnes. INCO may record higher nickel matte production and sales in the coming years as new pits at Pomalaa and Bahodopi come online. According to management guidance, INCO could add 1.7 million wet metric tonnes (wmt) of saprolite sales in 2025, consisting of 1.4 million wmt from Bahodopi and 300,000 wmt from Pomalaa. Previously, INCO did not sell saprolite nickel ore and only sold nickel in matte form.\\n\\nKey Takeaway\\nWe see INCO’s recovery outlook will be influenced by: 1) nickel price trends amid oversupply conditions; 2) the company’s efficiency efforts; and 3) sales volume growth from nickel ore contributions from the new Pomalaa and Bahodopi pits.",
