      "title": "Unilever Indonesia ($UNVR) Further Details on Ice Cream Business Sale",
      "content": "On November 25, 2024, Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) announced the agreement to sell its ice cream business for IDR 7 trillion (excluding VAT), which we previously wrote about in Stockbit Commentary. UNVR has just announced further details regarding the transaction. Here are some key points: The Ice Cream Business Contributed 9.5% of Revenue in 2023, with Negative Growth - During 2019-2023, the ice cream business recorded negative sales growth of -2% CAGR, with market share dropping from 69.2% in 2019 to 61.9% in 9M24. The sales decline of the ice cream business was slightly better than the performance of UNVR's overall sales which fell -2.6% CAGR over the same period. Furthermore, UNVR also mentioned that the profitability of the ice cream business continued to decline from 11.1% in 2019 to 7.2% in 2023. A profitability of ~7% is relatively in line with what we wrote previously (mid-high single digit). The information above implies that the profit of the ice cream business was around IDR 264 billion in 2023, making the transaction valuation 26.5x P/E. Potential Additional Dividend with an Indication Yield of 5.3% - UNVR plans to distribute the net proceeds from this transaction directly to shareholders via cash dividend after the transaction is completed. Based on proforma financial statements, UNVR will record a profit of IDR 3.8 trillion (after tax) from this transaction. Assuming all is distributed as a dividend, this amount indicates a dividend yield of 5.3% based on UNVR's share price at the stock market close on Friday (6/12) at IDR 1,870 per share. However, the planned transaction completion date has not been announced as it still awaits several processes, while the GMS for transaction approval is scheduled for January 14, 2025. Key Takeaway: We assess the plan to sell the ice cream business as positive for UNVR. Amidst various challenges currently faced by the company - including in the ice cream business up to now - this divestment can make the company more focused in running its business. The transaction valuation at 26.5x P/E is also considered premium, given the resulting business performance (negative growth with lower profitability). For comparison, Campina Ice Cream Industry (CAMP) trades at a valuation of 21.4x P/E (TTM) as of the stock market close today, Monday (9/12). On this day, UNVR's share price closed higher by +1.34% at IDR 1,895 per share. *This article was first released as Stockbit Commentary on Monday (9/12) morning.",
