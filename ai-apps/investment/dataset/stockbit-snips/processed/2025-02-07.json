      "content": "MSCI announced that Barito Renewables Energy (BREN), Petrindo Jaya Kreasi (CUAN), and Petrosea (PTRO) will not be included in the MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index review for February 2025 after analysis and input regarding potential investability constraints. The MSCI February 2025 index review announcement is scheduled for 11 February 2025. In response, BREN President Director Hendra Tan said the MSCI decision is entirely the authority of the index provider and beyond the company's control, and that BREN will continue to focus on sustainable growth. Previously, BREN was removed from the FTSE Global Equity Series – Large Cap by FTSE Russell on 19 September 2024, just one month after its inclusion, due to free‑float issues caused by a high concentration of ownership, with 97% of shares held by four shareholders. BREN's share price fell from 11,025 rupiah on 19 September 2024 to 7,225 rupiah on 22 September 2024, a decline of 34%. Nevertheless, BREN clarified to the Indonesia Stock Exchange on 22 September 2024 that the number of shares meeting the free‑float requirement was 15.6 billion shares, or 11.66% of the total shares outstanding on 19 September 2024, which is not significantly different from the prospectus free‑float of 11.73%. Following today's MSCI announcement on Friday (7/2), the three stocks closed lower, with BREN down 19.94%, CUAN down 19.96%, and PTRO down 24.61%. MSCI stated that it will continue to review the eligibility of these stocks in future index reviews and will provide further communication as needed.",
