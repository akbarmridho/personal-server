      "content": "Antara reports that the OJK ensures its readiness to approve gradually if there are proposals related to the increase in the minimum free float up to 30 percent. Currently, the OJK is considering raising the minimum free float rule from 7.5% to 10% for companies listed on the Indonesian stock exchange. The Director of Company Valuation at IDX, I Gede Nyoman Yetna, stated that IDX is conducting a study related to the free float regulation, while still considering the condition from the listed companies' side and investor capacity. Previously, the Chairman of DPR Commission XI, Mukhamad Misbakhun, proposed that the minimum free float in the Indonesian capital market could rise to the range of 30%, reflecting similar regulations in stock exchanges in Southeast Asian countries.Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi, stated on Monday (6/10) that a new Presidential Regulation (Perpres) regarding the waste-to-energy program which revises Perpres No. 35/2018 will be issued this week. Eniya added that the Perpres will mandate local governments to provide land and waste levies or fees paid by the public for waste logistics, and require feedstock or raw material for the waste-to-energy power plant (PLTSa) to be available for 30 years.Goldman Sachs on Monday (6/10) raised its gold price projection for December 2026 from 4,300 US dollars per troy ounce to 4,900 US dollars per troy ounce. This projection upgrade is based on strong projected gold purchases by central banks - where Goldman Sachs estimates average purchases by central banks will reach 80 tons in 2025 and 70 tons in 2026 - and increasing demand for gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) along with the projected 100 bps Fed interest rate cuts in mid-2026.The Malaysian Palm Oil Association estimates that Malaysian palm oil production decreased by -2.4% MoM in September 2025 to reach 1.81 million tons, which is more moderate than the Bloomberg consensus survey last week which projected a -4.3% MoM decrease. Head of Trading and Hedging Strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental, Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, mentioned that the production decline in Malaysia could support palm oil prices amid potential demand decline from India following the end of the festive season and the onset of winter. Palm oil tends to thicken in cold weather, pushing buyers to switch to other options like soybean oil. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources officially issued Ministerial Regulation No. 17/2025 which cuts the validity period of the work plan and budget (RKAB) from 3 years to 1 year. This step is aimed at giving the government greater control over production rates and supporting commodity prices. This change will take effect soon, according to a statement from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on Tuesday (7/10). The production quota for 2025 remains valid, but mining companies need to reapply for quotas previously issued for 2026 and 2027.Bank Indonesia noted that adjusted primary money (M0) grew by +18.6% YoY in September 2025 to reach 2,152.4 trillion rupiah (vs. August 2025: +7.3% YoY), influenced by a +37% YoY growth in general bank deposits at Bank Indonesia adjusted and a +13.5% YoY growth in currency in circulation. Bank Indonesia explained that this adjusted M0 growth has taken into account the impact of liquidity incentives provided.Bank Indonesia noted that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of September 2025 fell to the level of 148.7 billion US dollars (vs. August 2025: 150.7 billion US dollars), marking a decline for 3 consecutive months as well as the lowest level in the last 14 months. This result was influenced by the policy of stabilizing the rupiah exchange rate and the government's foreign debt payments. The position of foreign exchange reserves at the end of September 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.2 months of imports or 6 months of imports and government foreign debt payments, which is above the international adequacy standard of about 3 months of imports.",
