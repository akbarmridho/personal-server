      "title": "Gold Prices Break US$4,000 per Ounce, All-Time High",
      "content": "Spot gold prices surged to an intraday high of US$4,050 per troy ounce on Wednesday (8/10) before easing to US$4,035 per troy ounce, up 1.3%. This represents a 4.4% increase in gold prices over the past week. The rally was driven by heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid uncertainty in the US economy following the government shutdown that began on 1 October 2025. The shutdown delayed the release of key US economic data needed by the Federal Reserve to set future interest-rate policy, especially as labor-market data weakened while inflation remained high. Investor interest shifted toward gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs); Bloomberg reported that September 2025 saw the largest monthly inflow into gold ETFs in more than three years. Charu Chanana of Saxo Capital Markets said retail investors and ETFs are now the main drivers of gold price movements. In addition to the shutdown, gold demand was supported by a shift in asset allocation as AI-sector equities appeared overvalued, prompting Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio to express concerns about an AI bubble. Since the start of the year, gold has risen 52% due to global trade uncertainty, expectations of rate cuts, a weakening Fed independence that fuels de-dollarisation, and geopolitical tensions, prompting central banks to increase gold purchases. Goldman Sachs on Monday (6/10) raised its December 2026 gold price forecast from US$4,300 to US$4,900 per ounce, citing strong central-bank buying and higher ETF demand driven by an anticipated 100-basis-point Fed rate cut by mid-2026. The higher gold price could boost earnings of pure-play gold miners such as $BRMS, $ARCI and $PSAB, whose mining segment contributed 100%, 79% and 100% respectively to total revenue in the first half of 2025.",

      "content": "Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said on Tuesday (7/10) that the government plans to mandate a 50% biodiesel blend (B50) in 2026 to reduce diesel imports. Earlier, he indicated a possible 45% blend before moving to B50. Laboratory tests for B50 were completed in August 2025 and road testing is ready. The mandate will require 20.1 million kiloliters of palm-oil-based biofuel per year, up from 15.6 million kiloliters for the current B40 blend. Following this announcement, December 2025 CPO futures rose 1.7% to RM4,546 per ton after briefly reaching RM4,571 intraday. The minister also said the government is considering a 10% bio-ethanol blend in gasoline, a measure approved by President Prabowo Subianto, aimed at cutting carbon emissions and fuel import dependence. Pertamina CEO Simon Aloysius Mantiri confirmed readiness to implement the program. The Indonesian Spirits and Ethanol Producers Association reported a 2024 production capacity of 303,325 kiloliters, actual production of 160,946 kiloliters, imports of 11,829 kiloliters, domestic demand of 125,937 kiloliters and exports of 46,839 kiloliters. Gaikindo reported September 2025 wholesale car sales of 62,071 units, a 15% YoY decline but a 0.5% MoM increase, bringing 9-month sales to 561,819 units, 11% below YoY and representing 62-75% of the 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 units. Bank Indonesia noted the Indonesian Consumer Confidence Index fell to 115 in September 2025, the lowest since April 2022, down from 117.2 in August 2025 and 123.5 in September 2024, with declines across most sub-indices except a slight rise in job-availability expectations. The International Energy Agency’s latest outlook (7/10) projects global renewable electricity capacity to grow by 4,600 GW by 2030, 5% lower than its October 2024 outlook due to policy shifts in the US and China. Over 80% of the projected global renewable capacity increase is expected to come from solar, driven by low costs and faster permitting. India is forecast to have the second-largest renewable growth after China, which will still account for 60% of global renewable expansion despite a policy shift from fixed-tariff to auction-based schemes. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said the remaining surplus allocation (SAL) previously placed with Bank Indonesia will be redirected to Bank Jakarta and the East Java Regional Development Bank (BJTM), each receiving roughly IDR 5-10 trillion, continuing the practice of placing SAL in state-owned banks without affecting liquidity or monetary policy. President Prabowo Subianto appointed Dony Oskaria as head of the State-Owned Enterprises Regulatory Agency (BP BUMN) on Wednesday (8/10). Oskaria had been acting Minister of State-Owned Enterprises before the agency’s name change. He was joined by Aminuddin Ma'ruf and Tedi Bharata as deputy heads of BP BUMN.",
