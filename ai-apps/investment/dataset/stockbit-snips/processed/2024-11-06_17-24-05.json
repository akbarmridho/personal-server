      "title": "Trump Ahead in Quick Count, IHSG Under Pressure",
      "content": "Donald Trump is projected to have secured more than 270 electoral votes and defeated Kamala Harris in the US presidential election, based on quick count results released by Reuters, NBC News, and the New York Times on Wednesday (6/11) local time. In general, Trump outlined a number of protectionist policies that focus more on domestic economic development, including: Lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% (vs. previously: 21%). Imposing import duties of 10-20% on all imported goods. Specifically for China, the import duty imposed will be 60%. In response to the projection of Trump's victory, the US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened +1.32% to the level of 104.8 today, Wednesday (6/11), while the 10-year US government bond yield rose +12 bps to the level of 4.4%. In Indonesia, news of Trump's victory suppressed the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar, causing it to drop -0.6% to the level of 15,840 today, marking the lowest level in the last 3 months. Meanwhile, the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose +11 bps to the level of 6.85%. It should be noted that the weakening of the exchange rate was also seen in other emerging market currencies, with the Malaysian Ringgit (-1.3%) and the Philippine Peso (-0.58%) also weakening in today's trading. Following the weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate since this morning, the Director of Monetary Management and Security Assets at Bank Indonesia, Fitra Jusdiman, said that his office is ready to stabilize the Rupiah exchange rate from volatility. Fitra stated that Bank Indonesia will implement a triple intervention, targeting the foreign exchange spot market, the domestic non-deliverable forward, and the secondary government bond market.",

      "content": "We see that protectionist policies from Trump potentially strengthen the US dollar. Generally, this can negatively affect the IHSG because it triggers outflows from foreign investors, especially for companies that have large exposure (debt/imports) in US dollars. From an economic aspect, protectionist policies from Trump can also negatively affect Indonesia's economic growth, considering the US is the second-largest net export source for Indonesia. In today's trading, Wednesday (6/11), foreign investors recorded a foreign outflow of 1.1 trillion rupiah, with big banks such as BMRI (-5.4%; foreign outflow 583 billion rupiah), BBNI (-5.1%; foreign outflow 132 billion rupiah), and BBRI (-2.3%; foreign outflow 480 billion rupiah) experiencing significant declines. Meanwhile, several issuers with large US dollar debt/imports also experienced declines, such as ICBP (-3.6%), PWON (-5.3%), and MAPI (-5.8%). On the other hand, the weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar can narrow the space for Bank Indonesia to lower interest rates. The Bloomberg consensus expects a BI interest rate cut of -25 bps until the end of 2024.",

      "title": "Government Policy Updates",
      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that the government will issue new regulations regarding provincial minimum wage (UMP) in the near future. Airlangga mentioned that the new UMP regulation will adjust the Constitutional Court's decision which partially granted the laborers' demands regarding the employment cluster in the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Once the UMP determination mechanism is set, the government will revise Government Regulation Number 51 of 2023. The period for determining the UMP itself is due on November 21, 2024, with the announcement schedule for regency/city minimum wages no later than November 30, 2024. The Head of the Indonesia Domestic Investment Authority (BPI Danantara), Muliaman Darmansyah Hadad, said that President Prabowo Subianto will inaugurate BPI Danantara as the new manager of state wealth funds on November 7, 2024. Going forward, BPI Danantara is targeted to become the 4th largest sovereign wealth fund in the world with a managed fund target reaching 982 billion US dollars. In the initial stage, BPI Danantara will receive managed funds amounting to 10.8 billion US dollars sourced from the assets of the Indonesia Investment Authority. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that the government is preparing incentives for labor-intensive sectors to prevent layoffs amid declining middle-class numbers and public purchasing power. One of the incentives to be given is an investment credit incentive so that business actors in labor-intensive sectors can purchase machines that are more operationally efficient and have a larger output per unit. The President Director of PT Eramet Indonesia Mining, Jerome Baudelet, said that his company has started lithium exploration studies - which is one of the raw materials for electric vehicle batteries - in Grobogan Regency, Central Java. In the initial stage, PT Eramet Indonesia Mining will focus on obtaining lithium brine samples, which are saline groundwater deposits containing dissolved lithium. The Head of the Kadin Indonesia Public Policy Permanent Committee, Chandra Wahjudi, said that the discourse on extending the deadline for the placement of Export Proceeds (DHE) from natural resources will reduce company liquidity. Chandra also hopes the government can provide new incentives such as access to financing with more competitive interest rates, in addition to fiscal incentives in the form of larger tax reductions. Previously, the government planned to extend the holding period obligation for DHE from natural resources from the current provision which requires exporters to keep 30% of DHE in the domestic financial system for a minimum period of 3 months. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that the government is opening the opportunity for additional incentives for exporters who place DHE, although he did not detail the additional incentives to be provided. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, officially issued Minister of Finance Regulation Number 81 of 2024 concerning taxation in the context of implementing the core taxation system. This regulation governs taxpayer registration, tax payments and deposit, up to the submission method for annual tax returns (SPT). This regulation is effective starting January 1, 2025, and will revoke 42 previous taxation regulations. Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) has submitted an investment proposal valued at almost 10 million US dollars in Indonesia. The proposal includes investment in an accessories and gadget component factory in Bandung, West Java, in partnership with its suppliers. This investment proposal was submitted after the Indonesian government banned the sale of the iPhone 16 series, which had not yet met the 40% domestic component level (TKDN). The government previously stated that the TKDN for the iPhone 16 series could not yet be granted because Apple had only realized an investment of 1.5 trillion rupiah, lower than its commitment of 1.7 trillion rupiah.",

This margin recovery will be driven by 3 factors: 1) the continuation of the selling price increase implemented in October 2024; 2) the strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate against the Rupiah; and 3) raw material stock costs which will begin to decline following commodity price decreases. Previously, MYOR's gross profit margin dropped in 3Q24 to 20.5% (vs. 3Q23: 26.9%, 2Q24: 23.5%), pressured by high raw material costs, especially coffee and cocoa, as well as the weakening of the US Dollar exchange rate negatively impacting the translation of export sales into Rupiah. MYOR management is also optimistic about achieving the FY24 revenue growth guidance of up to +12%, based on strong sales growth in October 2024 (+20% YoY) continuing the momentum from 3Q24 (+17% YoY).",
