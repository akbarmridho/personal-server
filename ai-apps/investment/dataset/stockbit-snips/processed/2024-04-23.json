      "title": "BUMI Plans to Eliminate US$2.35 Billion Accumulated Deficit",
      "content": "Bumi Resources announced on Tuesday (23/4) a plan to carry out a quasi-reorganization using the consolidated financial statements dated 31 December 2023. The quasi-reorganization is an accounting procedure to restructure equity by eliminating a negative retained earnings balance. Through this corporate action, BUMI will eliminate its accumulated deficit of US$2.35 billion as of 2023. In exchange, additional paid-in capital of US$2.05 billion will be reduced to a negative US$298.69 million. Net equity will not change. Management explained that the benefits of the quasi-reorganization include: providing a true picture of the company's financial condition without the burden of past deficits; allowing dividend distribution because there will be no deficit balance; and facilitating easier access to financing for business development. BUMI last paid a dividend in 2012. Under Law No. 40 of 2007, dividends can only be paid when retained earnings are positive. Other issuers that have performed quasi-reorganizations include Garuda Indonesia in 2013 and Solusi Bangun Indonesia in 2010. The potential to resume dividend payments could increase BUMI’s attractiveness to investors, although its dividend-paying capacity is not as strong as coal producers such as ADRO, ITMG and PTBA, which have stronger cash positions. Based on 2023 financials, BUMI had cash of US$76.8 million, debt of US$306.6 million and equity of US$2.77 billion, giving a net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08x. Operationally, BUMI recorded operating profit of US$56.8 million with interest expense of US$22.5 million, resulting in net profit of US$10.9 million. On Tuesday (23/4) the market responded positively, with BUMI shares rising 21.18% to IDR 103 per share.",
