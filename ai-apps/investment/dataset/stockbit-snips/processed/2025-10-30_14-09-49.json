      "title": "The Fed Cuts Interest Rates, US-China Reach New Agreement",
      "content": "The US central bank, The Fed, on Wednesday (10/29) local time decided to cut the US interest rate by -25 bps to the range of 3.75-4%, in line with consensus expectations. This marks The Fed's 2nd consecutive rate cut amid concerns over the weakening US labor market. Nevertheless, the Chairman of The Fed, Jerome Powell, stated that the committee does not guarantee further US interest rate cuts in the next meeting in December 2025. This is due to the hindered release process of the latest US economic data caused by the government shutdown since early October 2025, as well as still high US inflation. For context, at last month's meeting, The Fed projected 2 more rate cuts by the end of 2025 to the range of 3.5-3.75%. Besides interest rate policy, The Fed also announced it would halt the shrinkage of its asset portfolio (quantitative tightening) starting December 1, 2025, ending the process that began in 2022, along with liquidity tightening in the money market and declining bank reserves. In separate news, US President Donald Trump said on Thursday (10/30) that he would reduce tariffs on China by 10 percentage points, resulting in total tariffs on China imports falling from 57% to 47%. The announcement was made after Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) event in South Korea. Trump also stated that the US had reached an agreement with China that includes several important points: China will not impose drastic restrictions on rare earth minerals exports to the US, China continues soybean imports from the US, and China will crack down on illegal trade of fentanyl precursor compounds to the US. Trump said this agreement will be valid for 1 year and is expected to be renewed annually. Additionally, both parties also discussed access for US-made chips—including AI chips from Nvidia—amid moves by Chinese authorities who previously tightened imports of these chips and encouraged domestic technology companies to switch to local products. Key Takeaway: With inflation as one of the factors The Fed considers in interest rate decisions, we assess that the agreement between the US and China—including tariff reductions—can be a positive development for the US inflation outlook. Nevertheless, when the government shutdown will end remains an uncertainty for the market, so investors need to monitor this. The market itself appears to have priced in expectations of positive developments from the Trump and Xi meeting, reflected in the market reaction being muted with several indices slightly down as of Thursday (10/30) afternoon, such as in Asia (Shanghai Composite -0.73%), Europe (Stoxx 50 -0.50%), and the US (S&P Futures -0.04%).",

The weakening of Non-Interest Income was caused by lower Recovery income of -35% YoY/-14% YoY in 3Q25/9M25. On the other hand, provision expenses declined in 3Q25 (-6% YoY, -6% QoQ), but provision expenses for 9M25 still increased by +14% YoY, thus suppressing net profit.",

The 3Q25 net profit growth was mainly driven by: 1) revenue growth (+23% YoY, +1% QoQ); and 2) operating profit margin expansion to 24.5% (vs. 3Q24: 22.3%, 2Q25: 23.6%). Revenue growth in 3Q25 was supported by both segments of the company, with 'consumer foods' growing strongly (+29% YoY, -9% QoQ) and the 'dairy' segment experiencing improvement (+15% YoY, +19% QoQ). Operating expense growth was relatively moderate compared to revenue, so operating profit in 3Q25 increased to 666 billion rupiah (+34% YoY, +4% QoQ). Net profit growth in 3Q25 was also helped by net financial income reaching 107 billion rupiah (vs. 3Q24: financial expense of 62 billion rupiah, 2Q25: financial income of 17 billion rupiah).",

This result led to a net profit for 9M25 reaching 4.5 trillion rupiah (-14% YoY), below expectations as it equals 68% of the consensus 2025F estimate (vs. 9M24: 79% annual realization). Revenue in 3Q25 still declined by -7% YoY, but this was compensated by an increase in gross profit margin to 20.2% (vs. 3Q24: 16.5%, 2Q25: 17.5%) as a result of no excise tax increase this year, which also raised the operating profit margin to 10.4% (vs. 3Q24: 7.8%, 2Q25: 6.1%). Although the 9M25 net profit performance is below expectations, generally the recovery trend in the financial statements is visible through the quarterly increase in revenue in 3Q25 by +8% QoQ, driven by seasonality effects boosting volume (+7% QoQ) and the beginning of an increase in average selling price (+1% QoQ). This marks the first quarterly increase in the average selling price since 3Q24.",
