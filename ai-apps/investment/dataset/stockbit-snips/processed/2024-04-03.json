      "title": "HRUM announces three corporate actions involving nickel assets and HPAL smelter acquisition",
      "content": "Harum Energy (HRUM) announced three corporate actions this week, each involving the acquisition of shares in nickel companies through loan conversion schemes. 1. Acquisition of 51% of PT Blue Sparking Energy (BSE) by HRUM through its subsidiary PT Tanito Harum Nickel (THN). HRUM converts a portion of a US$206.2 million loan into 1.04 million shares (51%) of BSE. Prior to this transaction, HRUM held no stake in BSE. BSE is developing a HPAL smelter with a capacity of 67,000 tons of nickel MHP and 7,500 tons of cobalt MHP per year at Weda Bay Industrial Park, targeted for commercial operation in 2026. 2. New share issuance in PT Harum Nickel Perkasa (HNP). HRUM acquires 8.48 million new HNP shares via a loan conversion worth approximately IDR 8.5 trillion (US$540 million). After the transaction, HRUM's ownership in HNP rises from 99.95% to 99.99%. The transaction aims to strengthen HNP's capital structure and expand HRUM's nickel business. 3. New share issuance in PT Tanito Harum Nickel (THN). HRUM, HNP and a third party PT Mahkota Emas Nickel (MEN) acquire 12.47 million new THN shares via a loan conversion worth about IDR 12.5 trillion (US$794.2 million). After the transaction, HRUM's stake in THN falls from 39.58% to 22.27%, HNP's stake rises from 60% to 77.52%, and MEN's stake declines from 0.42% to 0.21%. HNP and THN are HRUM subsidiaries that manage nickel businesses. Since 2020, HRUM has made several acquisitions in nickel through these subsidiaries. THN holds 51% of PT Position and 99.99% of PT Infei Metal Industry. HNP holds 80.7% of PT Westrong Metal Industry. Key Takeaway: Only the BSE transaction is judged to have a direct positive impact on HRUM fundamentals, as BSE adds a new nickel asset to the company. The THN and HNP transactions are considered to have limited impact because HRUM's effective ownership in these entities does not change significantly after the deals. Since announcing the BSE transaction on Monday (1/4) afternoon, HRUM's share price has risen 8.5% over the past two days. The loan conversion of approximately US$206.2 million for 51% of BSE implies a valuation of BSE at US$404.2 million (IDR 6.4 trillion). In early October 2023, HRUM through THN signed a loan facility agreement with BSE for US$500 million to develop the HPAL facility, of which US$300 million was disbursed on 17 October 2023. No detailed cost breakdown for the HPAL construction has been disclosed.",
