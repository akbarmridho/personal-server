      "content": "Several residential property issuers have announced their marketing sales realizations for the first half of 2025, including Ciputra Development (CTRA), Summarecon Agung (SMRA), and Pakuwon Jati (PWON) [see table].\n\nCTRA recorded the highest realization against its marketing sales target (52%). The relatively good 1H25 performance of CTRA was supported by the launch of a new cluster contributing approximately 54% to total marketing sales in 2Q25. Meanwhile, SMRA recorded a high 1H25 marketing sales growth (+42% YoY), resulting in a better realization against the marketing sales target (43%) compared to last year (1H24: 34% against target).\n\nThe 1H25 marketing sales achievement was also driven by a 100% value-added tax (VAT) incentive (PPN DTP) borne by the government. During 1H25, PWON was the issuer with the highest contribution of the VAT incentive to marketing sales, where 75% of the company's total realized marketing sales came from products eligible for the incentive. Meanwhile, SMRA has not released data on the contribution of the VAT incentive. However, in 1H24, the contribution of products eligible for the incentive reached 61% of SMRA's marketing sales.\n\nThe 100% VAT incentive ends in June 2025. For the period July-December 2025, the incentive will be reduced to 50%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn general, the realization of marketing sales in the second half of 2025 may be more challenging as the incentive amount declines, requiring other positive catalysts to support sales. On the other hand, investors should monitor the Bank Indonesia interest rate decision on Wednesday (16/7). Of the 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 18 expect a rate cut, while the remainder expect the rate to be maintained. Although the positive impact of a rate cut on sales is considered limited, a rate cut could still provide positive sentiment for property stocks.",
