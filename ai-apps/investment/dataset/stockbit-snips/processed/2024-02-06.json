      "title": "Government Targets International Tourist Visits +45% YoY in 2024",
      "content": "Tourism Minister and Creative Economy Minister Sandiaga Uno raised the target for foreign tourist arrivals (wisman) to Indonesia in 2024 from 14.3 million to 17 million. The target is 45.5% higher than the 2023 realization of 11.68 million arrivals. Sandiaga said that the increase is based on the solid 2023 performance, where foreign tourist arrivals grew 98.3% YoY and exceeded the 8.5 million target by 137.4%. According to BPS data, the 2023 foreign tourists were dominated by five countries: Malaysia (1.9 million), Australia (1.43 million), Singapore (1.41 million), China (787,924), and Timor Leste (728,586). The average stay length was between 7 and 12 nights. Hotel occupancy in Indonesia rose 2.84 percentage points in 2023 to 59.74%. Sandiaga is optimistic that tourism can support Indonesia's economic growth target of 5.2% in 2024. Planned initiatives to boost foreign arrivals include increasing the number of events and flights, and visa-free entry for 20 countries outside Southeast Asia. Although foreign arrivals far exceeded the 2023 target, Kompas reported that domestic tourist mobility (wisnus) in 2023 is unlikely to meet the target of 1.2-1.4 billion trips. BPS has not yet released the total domestic trips for 2023; however, data up to November 2023 showed 668.9 million trips, a 12% YoY increase but only 55.7% of the minimum target. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy targets domestic mobility of 1.25-1.5 billion trips in 2024 and will cooperate with the Ministry of Transportation to lower air ticket prices, a major concern for domestic travelers. The 2024 foreign tourist target is higher than the pre-pandemic level of 16.1 million in 2019. If achieved, the increase could positively affect tourism-related issuers such as GIAA, PANR, and BAYU, as well as alcoholic beverage issuers like WINE, MLBI, DLTA, and BEER.",

PTPP recorded a new contract value of IDR 3.5 trillion in January 2024, a 99.96% YoY increase, representing about 10.5% of the 2024 target of roughly IDR 33.3 trillion.
