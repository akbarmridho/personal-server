      "title": "Himbara Raise US Dollar Deposit Rates to 4%",
      "content": "The state-owned bank group (Himbara) - consisting of Bank Rakyat Indonesia ($BBRI), Bank Mandiri ($BMRI), Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI), and Bank Tabungan Negara ($BBTN) - announced on Wednesday (24/9) that they will increase the counter rate for US dollar-denominated deposits to 4% per annum effective November 5, 2025. This increase applies to all balance categories and all tenors up to 12 months. This move follows the statement by the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, who said on Friday (19/9) that the government is preparing market-based incentives to encourage fund owners to prefer placing their US dollar deposits domestically. These incentives are expected to strengthen national foreign exchange reserves, increase the supply of US dollars in banking, and facilitate the financing needs of strategic government projects. This policy is expected to support the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, which depreciated again to 16,676 per Wednesday (24/9), marking the weakest level since April 2025. The weakening of the rupiah over the past week was primarily caused by negative sentiment related to the issues of: 1) weakening Bank Indonesia independence; and 2) the potential increase in government debt (deficit) to boost economic growth. Meanwhile, the Deposit Insurance Corporation lowered the maximum guaranteed interest rate for foreign currency (forex) deposits in conventional banks by 25 bps to 2%, and lowered the maximum guaranteed interest rate for rupiah deposits in conventional banks by 25 bps to 3.5%. Key Takeaway: We assess that the potential impact of this decision will be limited (limited impact) on the overall cost of fund (CoF) of Himbara banks, considering: 1) the insignificant composition of US dollar deposits against total deposits; and 2) the effective CoF - based on 1H25 financial reports - which is already around the 4% range, except for BBTN. Meanwhile, based on OJK data, the average interest rate for forex deposits - which are mostly US dollars - is not far from the 4% level, with national private banks generally offering higher interest rates than Himbara.",
