      "title": "Target APBN 2025 Revised: Deficit Widens, Economic Growth Slows",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance reported the APBN realization up to the first half of 2025 (1H25) in a working meeting with the DPR Budget Agency on Tuesday (1 July). Important points from the presentation are as follows: State revenue fell by 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) in 1H25, reaching only 40 percent of the 2025 APBN target (versus 47 percent in 1H24). This achievement is slightly better than the 5-month 2025 (5M25) result, which declined 11 percent YoY, mainly because the June 2025 figure already started to grow positively in double-digit annual terms. Tax revenue declined 7 percent YoY in 1H25, improving compared with the 5M25 realization that fell 10 percent. According to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani, the contraction in state revenue during 1H25 was mainly caused by weaker commodity prices, the transfer of state-owned enterprise dividends to the State Treasury, and the cancellation of the 12 percent value-added tax (except for luxury goods). Government spending, on the other hand, grew about 0.6 percent YoY in 1H25 and reached 39 percent of the 2025 APBN target (versus 42 percent in 1H24). This result improved compared with the 5M25 realization, which fell 11 percent YoY. The acceleration of spending was driven primarily by the opening of budget blocking after an efficiency initiative. The realization of revenue and spending during 1H25 resulted in a deficit of IDR 204.2 trillion, equivalent to 0.84 percent of GDP (versus 0.34 percent in 1H24). Sri Mulyani stated that the deficit outlook for the APBN until the end of 2025 is projected to reach IDR 662 trillion, or 2.78 percent of GDP, larger than the initial projection of IDR 616.2 trillion or 2.53 percent of GDP. To help close the 2025 APBN deficit, Sri Mulyani recently applied to the DPR for the use of a surplus allocation of IDR 85.6 trillion. Meanwhile, the government also revised the 2025 macro-economic assumptions after considering recent global dynamics and the 1H25 realization. The 2025 economic growth projection was revised down from +5.2 percent YoY to around +4.7-5 percent YoY. Other changes and the assumptions for the 2026 revised APBN can be seen in the table above. Key Takeaway: The APBN realization in 1H25 began to show improvement in June 2025, both in state revenue and government spending. The increase in spending in the second half of 2025 is expected to support economic growth. In addition to accelerated spending, investors should also watch the trade agreement between Indonesia and the United States. The US government plans to announce the trade deal with several countries on Friday (4 July) with a deadline set for Wednesday (9 July).",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump said that the new tariff rates to be announced by the deadline of 9 July 2025 will range between 10 and 70 percent, higher than the maximum reciprocal tariff announced in April 2025 at 50 percent. He did not specify which countries will receive the tariffs nor which products may face higher rates. Trump said the US will send tariff notices to partner countries starting Friday (4 July), with 10 or 12 letters sent on Friday and the remainder in the following days.\n3. The US Labor Statistics Bureau recorded that non-farm payrolls in the United States increased by 147,000 in June 2025 (versus 144,000 in May 2025), exceeding the consensus expectation of 110,000. The US unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent in June 2025 (versus 4.2 percent in May 2025), better than the consensus expectation of 4.3 percent. These results indicate that the US economy remains resilient despite expectations of turbulence from President Trump's tariff policy. The strong labor market also supports the Federal Reserve's argument to keep interest rates high to curb inflation.\n4. The Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, said that the average utilization of the ceramic industry in 1H25 was around 70-71 percent, with production volume rising 16.5 percent YoY to 218 million square meters. Although utilization improved compared with 1H24's 60 percent, it remains below the 1H25 target of 75 percent. He explained that demand for ceramics is stagnant due to weakened consumer purchasing power, a slowdown in the property sector, and suboptimal government projects. He also noted a new challenge: a surge in Indian ceramic imports, estimated to increase by 150 percent in the fourth quarter of 2025, creating oversupply in India and positioning Indonesia as a diversion market for exports due to US tariffs.\n5. Reuters reported that the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association (APNI) urged the government to maintain the three-year mining quota to ensure a consistent business climate. The request follows Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia's statement that the government plans to reduce the duration of the work plan and cost budget (RKAB) from three years to one year to better control coal and ore supply. APNI warned that shortening the quota period could create obstacles in the approval process, as thousands of miners would need to apply for quotas each year, and emphasized the importance of medium-term certainty for investment and operational planning.\n6. National Development Planning Minister Rachmat Pambudy said that the number of beneficiaries of the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program is expected to jump from 5.2 million on 22 June 2025 to 20 million in August 2025, following the completion of staff training and kitchen facility readiness. The government targets 83 million MBG beneficiaries by the end of 2025. During 1H25, the Ministry of Finance recorded that the MBG program's budget realization reached only IDR 5 trillion, about 7 percent of the total allocation. The head of the National Nutrition Agency, Dadan Hindayana, said an additional IDR 50 trillion is needed for November and December 2025.",
