      "content": "On Monday, 20 January 2025, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) announced that the domestic market obligation (DMO) for coal in 2025 is targeted at 239.7 million tonnes, an increase of 32.2% compared with the 2024 target and 14.2% higher than the 2024 actual realization. The target was set based on a multilateral meeting with coal industry players and takes into account the 2025 electricity supply plan (RUPTL). The Executive Director of the Indonesian Mining Association, Hendra Sinadia, said the increase indicates the government will aim for higher domestic coal production and consumption, and called for a review of the DMO price for PLN, which has remained at US$70 per tonne for several years.",

He illustrated that if a company proposes to produce 20 million tonnes of nickel, the government would grant permits for only 60% of that amount, with the remaining 40% to be absorbed by local entrepreneurs. Previously, Bloomberg reported in December 2024 that the government was considering reducing the nickel ore quota from 272 million tonnes in 2024 to 150 million tonnes in 2025.",

The dispute originated in 2019 after the EU decided that crude palm oil would not be classified as biofuel because of deforestation concerns and that its use as transport fuel will be phased out between 2023-2030.
