      "content": "Car wholesale sales in Indonesia in April 2024 were recorded at 48,637 units, a decrease of -34.8% Month over Month (MoM) and -17.4% Year over Year (YoY). This realization, although affected by the Eid al-Fitr effect, still indicates weaker sales compared to car sales during the Eid al-Fitr period since 2021. In our view, the FY24 target from the association (Gaikindo) of 1.1 million units is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve with weak realization until 4M24, which only reached 24% of the FY24 target. Meanwhile, for stock prices, the negative sentiment from weak automotive sales (down ~20% YoY) will continue to overshadow the stock price movements of automotive issuers such as ASII, AUTO, and DRMA, all of which have weakened since the beginning of the year. We assess that signs of bottoming out in car sales figures (e.g., from -20% YoY to approaching -10% YoY) are needed to see a recovery in stock prices.",
