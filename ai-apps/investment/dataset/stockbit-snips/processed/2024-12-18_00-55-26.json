      "content": "RATU: Subsidiary of RAJA, IPO with Market Cap Rp2.4-3.1 T. The subsidiary of Rukun Raharja (RAJA), Raharja Energi Cepu (RATU), announced a plan for an IPO by offering 543.01 million shares (20%), consisting of 190 million (7%) new shares and 352.9 million (13%) divested shares from RAJA's ownership. The offering price range is between 900-1,150 rupiah per share, implying a market cap of around 2.4-3.1 trillion rupiah. Total proceeds from this IPO range from 488.7-624.5 billion rupiah, where approximately 171-218.6 billion rupiah will go to RATU's cash while approximately 317.7-405.9 billion rupiah will go to RAJA's cash. RATU is a holding company that invests as a non-operator in 2 oil and gas exploration blocks in Indonesia, namely the Cepu Block (participation rights ~2.2%) and the Jabung Block (participation rights 8%). During 1H24, the Cepu Block produced 144 MBOPD of oil, equivalent to ~25% of total national oil lifting as of 1H24. Meanwhile, the Jabung Block produced 52 MBOEPD of oil and gas, equivalent to ~3.5% of total national oil and gas lifting as of 1H24. Structure of Shareholders: After the IPO, RATU's shareholders consist of RAJA (~80%), PT Rukun Prima Sarana (0.004%), and the public (20%). Use of IPO Funds: All IPO funds will be allocated for working capital, namely: Approximately 157.36 billion rupiah will be loaned to PT Raharja Energi Tanjung Jabung to pay the cash call from PetroChina International Jabung Ltd. related to the management of the Jabung Block. Approximately 34.97 billion rupiah will be loaned to PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana to pay the cash call from ExxonMobil Cepu Ltd. related to the management of the Cepu Block. The remaining funds will be used for remuneration of employees, directors, commissioners, and operational costs. Valuation: RATU is offered at a valuation of approximately 6.0-7.6x Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) P/E based on 1H24. On an annualized 1H24 basis, RATU is offered at a valuation of approximately 10.3-13.2x P/E, lower than the valuation of RAJA which traded at 22.9x annualized 1H24 P/E as of Tuesday (17/12) at a level of 2,670 rupiah per share. Nevertheless, RATU's valuation is considered premium compared to its peers such as Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC) and Energi Mega Persada (ENRG) which traded at 4.5x and 4.9x annualized 9M24 P/E respectively as of Tuesday (17/12). Details of the valuation comparison of RATU with its peers can be seen in the table below: Key Takeaway: Although RATU's valuation is higher compared to its peers like MEDC and ENRG, at first glance we assess that RATU deserves a premium trading due to its superior profitability compared to its peers, as seen from its much higher ROE and ROA.",
