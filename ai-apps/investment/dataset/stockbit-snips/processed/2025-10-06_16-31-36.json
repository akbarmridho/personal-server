      "content": "Bloomberg reported that PT Super Bank Indonesia (Superbank) is starting to gauge investor interest for its IPO on the IDX, with the company scheduled to hold educational meetings for investors from October 6-17, 2025. 70% of the IPO proceeds will be used by Superbank as working capital for loan disbursement, while the remainder will be allocated for capital expenditure including the development of information technology systems and products. Bloomberg mentioned that CLSA Sekuritas will act as the joint global coordinator, while CNBC Indonesia reported that CLSA Sekuritas and Mandiri Sekuritas will be the underwriters for the IPO. Superbank's IPO plan first emerged in a Bloomberg report in January 2025, which mentioned that the company targeted IPO funds ranging from 200-300 million US dollars with a valuation between 1.5-2 billion US dollars. This amount indicates that Superbank will IPO by offering 10-20% of its total shares. Bloomberg at that time stated that Superbank's IPO plan was still under consideration and not yet certain to be realized, and the target fund raising amount and valuation could change at any time. Based on the company's website, Superbank's current shareholders include Elang Mahkota Teknologi ($EMTK) through PT Elang Media Visitama (31.11%), Grab through PT Kudo Teknologi Indonesia (19.16%), A5-DB Holdings (11.52%), and GXS Bank (12%), KakaoBank (9.95%), Singtel Alpha Investments (8.46%). During 1H25, Superbank recorded a net profit of 20.1 billion rupiah (vs. 1H24: a loss of 188 billion rupiah), supported by an increase in Net Interest Income to 667.6 billion rupiah (+171% YoY) along with a Net Interest Margin that rose to 10.2% (vs. 1H24: 8.1%).",

These assets - which include 6 tin smelters and raw minerals - are assets seized in last year's corruption investigation. President Prabowo Subianto explained that the estimated value of assets handed over to TINS does not yet include rare earth, so the value could be much greater. BRMS: Shareholders of Bumi Resources Minerals, Van Eck Associates Corporation, bought approximately 50.5 million BRMS shares at an average price of approximately 838.2 rupiah per share on September 30, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 42.3 billion rupiah. After this transaction, Van Eck Associates Corporation's direct ownership in BRMS increased from ~4.99% to ~5.03%. BMRI: Bloomberg reported that Bank Mandiri has disbursed loans worth 34.5 trillion rupiah to labor-intensive industries and SMEs from a liquidity injection fund of 55 trillion rupiah placed by the government. BMRI Director, Novita Widya Anggraini, estimates that credit disbursement from the liquidity injection received by her party can reach 100% by the end of 2025. Previously, President Director of Bank Rakyat Indonesia ($BBRI), Hery Gunardi, stated last week that his party had disbursed 45% of the 55 trillion rupiah liquidity injection received from the government.",

      "content": "OPEC+ on Sunday (5/10) decided to increase oil production by 137,000 barrels per day starting from November 2025 to reclaim its market share. This decision is lower than previous expectations, where Bloomberg last week reported that OPEC+ was considering an output increase of up to ~500,000 barrels per day to accelerate production recovery. Reuters reported that with this increase, OPEC+ has raised oil production by 2.7 million barrels per day since the beginning of 2025, equivalent to 2.5% of global demand. Gold prices in the spot market rose +1.5% to the level of 3,950 US dollars per troy ounce on Monday (6/10), marking an intraday all-time high. This increase was supported by rising demand for safe haven assets amidst uncertainty over the US government budget which delayed the release of employment data and boosted expectations for Fed interest rate cuts. Bitcoin prices broke the 125,689 US dollar level on Sunday (5/10) according to Bloomberg data, marking a new all-time high, before leveling off to 124,118 US dollars in Monday (6/10) trading. Previously, Bitcoin had set a record around 124,000 US dollars in August 2025 following more friendly US government policies towards cryptocurrencies and strong demand from institutional investors. The recent strengthening of Bitcoin prices is driven by inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and is in line with the strengthening of US stock exchanges. Bloomberg reported that TikTok shared user data from the national demonstration period at the end of August 2025 with the government late last weekend. TikTok took this step to avoid suspension of its operating license, after the government temporarily froze TikTok's electronic system provider registration certificate (TDPSE) on Friday (3/10). Director-General of the Ministry of Communication and Digital, Alexander Sabar, claimed that the data shared by TikTok was aggregate data so it could not be used to track individuals, adding that the focus would be on online gambling activities.",
