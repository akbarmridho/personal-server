      "title": "Wholesales Mobil August 2025 Remain at 60 Thousand Level, Down -19% YoY",
      "content": "Gaikindo reported that national automobile wholesales in August 2025 were recorded at 61,780 units (down 19% YoY, up 1% MoM), marking a yearly sales decline of around -20% YoY for three consecutive months. The August 2025 sales realization also confirms the weak performance of GIIAS 2025, which was held from July 24 to August 3, 2025. During July and August 2025, the average monthly sales only reached 61,329 units, 17% lower than the July 2024 sales level of 74,230 units, when GIIAS 2024 was held from July 18 to 24, 2024.\n\nThe August 2025 sales realization brings the national automobile wholesales for the first eight months of 2025 (8M25) to 500,952 units (down 11% YoY), equivalent to 56-67% of the 2025 target set by Gaikindo, which ranges between 750,000 and 900,000 units (vs. 8M24: 65% realization in 2024).\n\nBy brand, Astra International (ASII) recorded lower sales than the industry, causing its market share to fall below 50% in August 2025. This marks the lowest monthly market share for ASII in the last 12 months, although in recent years ASII has occasionally recorded market share below 50%. The low ASII market share was pressured by weak sales of Toyota+Lexus and Daihatsu, which each fell 29% YoY in August 2025. Over 8M25, Toyota+Lexus declined 12% YoY, while Daihatsu fell 25% YoY.\n\nOn the competitor side, Suzuki and Mitsubishi recorded year-over-year sales growth in August 2025, with increases of +12% YoY and +5% YoY respectively. We assess that the sales growth of both was driven by positive consumer response to the launch of the Suzuki Fronx and Mitsubishi Destinator. Meanwhile, the momentum of Chinese-brand sales halted since July 2025 and continued in August 2025, which we attribute to a price war that makes consumers adopt a wait-and-see attitude.\n\nKey Takeaway: Although automobile sales trends remain weak, we believe that low market expectations mean that actual sales no longer affect the stock price movements of automotive issuers. As we wrote previously, with low market expectations, stock prices can also be influenced by other factors, such as the strategic review currently undertaken by ASII. In the last month, automotive stocks have risen, with ASII +13.3%, AUTO +5.5%, and DRMA +3.6%. Specifically for ASII, we think investors should monitor the progress of the company's capital management plan – including its subsidiaries such as UNTR and AUTO – because a more optimal use of the balance sheet could provide further upside potential for the share price.",

      "content": "1. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said on Wednesday (Sept 10) that the government is open to revising the 2026 State Budget (RAPBN) proposal. He claimed that an agreement has been reached with DPR Commission XI to increase the regional transfer budget in 2026, contrary to the RAPBN 2026 proposal which projected a -25% YoY reduction. Previously, President Prabowo Subianto presented the 2026 RAPBN proposal prepared by Sri Mulyani to the DPR in August 2025, projecting a deficit of 2.48% of GDP and a 10% YoY increase in state revenue. The DPR usually takes until early October to approve the next year's budget.\n\n2. Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Dwisuryo Indroyono Soesilo, said Indonesia will seek lower U.S. tariffs for palm oil, nickel, copper, and other commodities during negotiations in Washington in September 2025. The government also aims for lower tariffs on shrimp, wood, and furniture.\n\n3. Bank Indonesia reported that the Indonesian Consumer Confidence Index fell to 117.2 in August 2025 (down from 118.1 in July 2025 and 124.4 in August 2024), the lowest level since September 2022. The decline was driven by drops across almost all sub-indices, except income expectations and business activity expectations. The most pronounced declines were in job availability expectations (-2.1 points) and job availability index (-2.2 points).\n\n4. Bank Indonesia forecasts retail sales in August 2025 to grow +2.7% YoY, although it expects a -0.3% MoM contraction. In July 2025, retail sales grew +4.7% YoY but contracted -4.1% MoM, lower than the bank's projection of +4.8% YoY and -4% MoM.\n\n5. Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso said that electric motor incentives will be continued and bundled into the Q3 2025 stimulus package. The Ministry of Finance had prepared a stimulus of IDR 10.8 trillion for Q3 2025 to sustain economic growth. She also mentioned that Economy Minister Airlangga Hartarto is preparing programs for 2026, and the ministry is reviewing technical certainty, incentive size, implementation timing, and new mechanisms to make incentives more accessible.\n\n6. The government plans to set the selling price of electricity from waste-to-energy power plants (PLTSa) to PLN at 20 US cents per kWh, up from the previous ceiling of 13.35 US cents per kWh. Deputy Energy Minister Yuliot Tanjung explained that the increase is due to the removal of the \"tipping fee\" scheme in the draft revision of Presidential Regulation No. 35/2018. The revision is expected to be finalized this month.\n\n7. Pertamina CEO Simon Aloysius Mantiri announced that the company plans to merge its refinery, shipping, and retail operations to improve core business efficiency, with completion expected by the end of 2025. Non-core businesses will be merged with similar state-owned enterprises, and discussions are ongoing with Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA) to merge Pelita Air with Garuda.\n\n8. Futura Energi Global (FUTR) announced that PT Aurora Dhana Nusantara completed the purchase of approximately 3 billion (45%) FUTR shares at IDR 11 per share, totaling about IDR 32.8 billion. Previously, FUTR disclosed that PT Aurora Dhana Nusantara signed a term sheet to acquire about 3.3 billion (49.325%) FUTR shares from existing shareholders PT Digital Futurama Global.",
