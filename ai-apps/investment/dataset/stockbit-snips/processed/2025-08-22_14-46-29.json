      "content": "Several construction issuers—namely, Adhi Karya ($ADHI), PT PP ($PTPP), and Total Bangun Persada ($TOTL)—have released the realization of new contract values during 7M25. In general, ADHI's new contract performance was the weakest among the three issuers, while PTPP recorded relatively the best performance. This assessment is based on the year-on-year growth of new contract values and the achievement against the 2025 target compared to last year's achievement trend. ADHI recorded new contract values amounting to 3.8 trillion rupiah during 7M25 (-68% YoY), equivalent to only about 14-15% of the 2025 target (vs. 7M24: 60% realization in 2024). Meanwhile, PTPP recorded new contracts worth 11.8 trillion rupiah during 7M25 (-10% YoY), equivalent to 41% of the 2025 target (vs. 7M24: 48% realization in 2024). In terms of financial performance, the net profits of PTPP and ADHI fell by -56% YoY and -45% YoY, respectively, during 1H25. Conversely, TOTL's net profit during 1H25 grew by +55% YoY in line with strong new contract growth in 2024 at the +21% YoY level.",

TOTL's Corporate Secretary, Anggie S. Sidharta, mentioned that TOTL is participating in several tenders with a pipeline value reaching approximately 8.9 trillion rupiah as of July 2025. Meanwhile, ADHI - through a joint operation with KBR and Samsung E&A - announced that it has received a winner determination letter for front-end engineering design (FEED) contract work on Inpex's LNG project in the Masela Block, although the contract value from this project has not yet been announced.",

      "content": "Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Friday (8/22) that the government has redirected part of its gas exports to the domestic market to meet demand, after domestic supply was briefly hampered due to a fire in one of the gas pipeline networks some time ago. Bahlil added that the government has rescheduled the affected gas exports, although he did not provide further details. Bahlil also claimed that the natural gas supply delivered by Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS) to industries in West Java and Sumatra has returned to normal. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated in a meeting with the DPR on Friday (8/22) that his office projects the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar in 2026 to range between 16,000-16,500, slightly weaker than the previous projection which was in the range of Rp 15,900–Rp 16,400 per US dollar in 2026. However, he emphasized that the tendency for the Rupiah would be maintained at the level of Rp 16,300 per US dollar. Bank Indonesia noted that economic liquidity or broad money supply (M2) in July 2025 grew by +6.5% YoY (vs. June 2025: +6.4% YoY), driven by the growth of narrow money supply (M1) by +8.7% YoY and quasi money by +4.8% YoY. The development of M2 in July 2025 was mainly influenced by the growth of net foreign assets (+7.3% YoY) and a contraction in net claims on the central government (-6.2% YoY). Reuters reported that Indian importers for the first time purchased palm oil from Colombia and Guatemala, as producers in both countries had surplus stock and offered cargoes at large discounts. Increased production in Colombia and Guatemala—and their ability to divert supplies at discounted prices—could weigh on the benchmark price of crude palm oil futures in Malaysia. The Vice President of Patanjali Foods Ltd., Aashish Acharya, stated that India's first purchase from the Latin American region could open up more supply source options. The Latin American region itself produces approximately 5 million tons of palm oil per year, with half of it exported to other regions. Indonesia and Malaysia still dominate global palm oil supply and are the main suppliers to India, which imported 9 million tons of palm oil in the 2023/2024 period. Colombia and Guatemala are the 4th and 6th largest palm oil producers in the world, respectively, where both countries usually export their surplus stock to Europe and North America. Muttaqien, a member of the National Social Security Council, stated on Thursday (8/21) that discussions regarding the increase in national health insurance premiums managed by BPJS Kesehatan have entered the finalization stage, although he did not provide further details. Previously, the Minister of Health, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, stated in February 2025 that his office, along with the Ministry of Finance and BPJS Kesehatan, was calculating the increase in BPJS Kesehatan premiums, with a tariff adjustment planned to take effect in 2026.",
