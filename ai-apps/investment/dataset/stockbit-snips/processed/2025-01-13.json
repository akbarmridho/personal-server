      "title": "US Labor Data Exceeds Expectations, Strengthening Higher‑for‑Longer Narrative",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non‑farm payroll employment increased by 256,000 in December 2024, compared with 212,000 in November 2024. This result far exceeded the consensus expectation of 160,000 and marked the strongest job growth since March 2024. The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in December 2024, down from 4.2% in November 2024, better than the consensus forecast of 4.2%. In response to the strong labor data, market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have receded. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a 25‑basis‑point rate cut by June 2025 fell to 39% on Monday (13 January) from 44% the week before, while the probability of rates remaining unchanged rose to 51% from 29% the week before. U.S. equity markets reacted negatively on Friday (10 January): the S&P 500 fell 1.54%, the Nasdaq fell 1.57%, and the DJIA fell 1.63%. The U.S. dollar index (DXY) strengthened 0.43% to 109.65, and the 10‑year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points to 4.76%. The rupiah weakened 0.56% to IDR 16,275 per USD on Monday (13 January). The Indonesian composite index (IHSG) fell 1.02% to 7,017, and the 10‑year Indonesian government bond yield rose 10 basis points to 7.28%, the highest level since November 2022. Edi Susianto, Head of the Monetary Management and Securities Department at Bank Indonesia, told Bloomberg that the central bank continues to safeguard currency stability through interventions in the bond market, the spot market, and domestic non‑deliverable forwards. Key Takeaway: Investors can lock in higher bond yields, such as the PBS032 bond (maturing in 1.5 years) offering a 6.8% annual yield, and may consider buying quality stocks that are currently correcting, such as Bank Mandiri (BMRI) and Bank Central Asia (BBCA). The prospect of fewer U.S. rate cuts could limit the space for Bank Indonesia to cut rates further. Bloomberg consensus expects Bank Indonesia to keep the policy rate at 6% at the Board of Governors meeting on Wednesday (15 January), although the consensus still anticipates a cumulative 75‑basis‑point cut to the BI Rate by the end of 2025.

      "content": "Brent crude for the March 2025 contract rose 1.78% to USD 81.2 per barrel on Monday (13 January) following the announcement of new U.S. sanctions on the Russian energy sector over the weekend. The United States said the sanctions would target more than 200 entities and individuals involved in Russia’s energy sector, including Gazprom Neft (ME: SIBN) and Surgutneftegas, as well as over 180 oil‑tanker vessels. The United Kingdom also announced sanctions on Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. Plt. Director General of Oil and Gas, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dadan Kusdiana said on Friday (10 January) that the government is studying the possibility of importing oil from Russia, a step that will be coordinated with relevant partners as Indonesia moves toward full BRICS membership. Moshe Rizal, Chairman of the Investment Committee of the National Oil and Gas Companies Association, estimated that such imports could save the state budget billions of dollars per year by using discounted Russian oil prices. Bisman Bakhtiar, Executive Director of the Center for Energy and Mining Law Studies, warned that importing Russian oil could affect Indonesia’s diplomatic relations with Western countries, especially the United States. Director General of Customs and Excise, Nirwala Dwi Heryanto, said on Friday (10 January) that the government plans to implement an excise tax on sweetened beverages (MBDK) in the second half of 2025 if the process proceeds smoothly. Technical regulations will first be prepared through a Government Regulation and a Ministry of Finance Regulation, covering thresholds, product types, and tax rates. Previously, in September 2024, the House of Representatives proposed a minimum MBDK tax of 2.5% for 2025, to be gradually increased to 20%. China reported import growth of 1% year‑on‑year to USD 230.79 billion in December 2024 (versus a November decline of 3.9% YoY), surpassing the consensus forecast of a 1.5% YoY decline and marking the highest level in 27 months. This was the first monthly import increase since September 2024 and the strongest growth since July 2024, driven by robust year‑end demand and expectations of tighter U.S. chip import restrictions. Cumulatively, China’s 2024 imports rose 1.1% YoY to USD 2.59 trillion. Gita Mahyarani, Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, said on Friday (10 January) that national coal production in 2025 is expected to rise as domestic demand increases and Indonesia joins BRICS, which will strengthen coal exports to China and India. Indonesia produced 831 million tonnes of coal in 2024 (+7.8% YoY) with sales of 811.54 million tonnes (+8% YoY), both exceeding the 2024 government targets by 17% and 8% respectively. The Ministry of Energy targets coal production of 740 million tonnes in 2025. Faisol Reza, Deputy Minister of Industry, said on Friday (10 January) that the government will replace the electric‑motor subsidy program of IDR 7 million per unit with a VAT incentive (PPN DTP). No timeline was provided as the mechanism is still under discussion. Joko Raharjo, Corporate Secretary of PT PP, said the company will allocate 26 hectares of land in the Greater Jakarta area, West Java, Yogyakarta, and Pekanbaru to support the joint Indonesia‑Qatar program to build one million houses.",
