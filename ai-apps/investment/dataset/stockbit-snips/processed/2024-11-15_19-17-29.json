      "title": "Powell Signals Slowdown in Interest Rate Cuts",
      "content": "The Fed Head, Jerome Powell, said on Thursday (11/14) that there is no need to rush to lower interest rates as the current economic conditions are very good. Powell's statement came just one day after the release of US inflation data for October 2024, which rose to 2.6% YoY (vs. September 2024: 2.4% YoY inflation), ending the 6-month trend of declining inflation. Powell affirmed that the Fed still considers inflation to be on a sustainable path towards the 2% target level, allowing the US central bank to move interest rates toward a more neutral level, which neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. Nevertheless, what that more neutral interest rate level is, and how quickly the Fed will achieve it, remains unknown. On the other hand, future US economic growth and inflation rates face uncertainty from the protectionist policies hinted at by the elected president, Donald Trump. Following Powell's less dovish statement, analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 bps at the December 2024 meeting sharply decreased, from 82.5% on November 13, 2024, to only 58.9% as of Friday (11/15). In line with this, the probability of a Fed interest rate cut of >=75 bps until June 2025 also dropped from 47% to 34% in the last week, while the probability of an interest rate cut of <75 bps until June 2025 increased from 53% to 66%. On Thursday (11/14), US stock exchanges collectively weakened, with S&P (-0.60%), Nasdaq (-0.64%), and DJI (-0.47%). The US Dollar Index (DXY) also strengthened (+0.09%) on Thursday (11/14), although it weakened by -0.1% to 15,855 by this afternoon, Friday (11/15), mainly supported by Bank Indonesia's intervention. The Governor of the Monetary Management and Securities Asset Department of Bank Indonesia, Edi Susianto, told Bloomberg that the fundamental level of the Rupiah is stronger than 16,000 per US dollar. Key Takeaway: A slower/smaller Fed interest rate cut in 2025 could reduce the room for Bank Indonesia to lower the BI Rate. As of today, the consensus gathered by Bloomberg projects that Bank Indonesia will cut rates by -100 bps until the end of 2025. From a market aspect, although foreign outflow from the IHSG continued today since Trump's victory, we observe that its value started to shrink to 517 billion rupiah. This decrease in outflow value might indicate that the majority of selling pressure has been realized (priced-in).",
