      "title": "State Budget Suffers Deficit in 2M25 as Revenues Plummet",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance held a briefing regarding the realization of the 2025 State Budget on Thursday (13/3). This was the first State Budget briefing in 2025, after the Ministry of Finance did not hold a discussion for January 2025 last month. Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated that the briefing for the realization of the State Budget as of January 2025 was not held to ensure the presentation of comparable and accurate data, considering several factors that occurred at the beginning of this year. Here are some of our notes regarding the realization of the State Budget in 2M25: State Revenue Drops -20.8% YoY, Equivalent to 10.5% of Target. Deputy Minister of Finance, Anggito Abimanyu, stated that gross tax revenue during 2M25 slowed down (-20.8% YoY) due to declines in commodity prices, including coal (-11.8% YoY), Brent oil (-5.2% YoY), and nickel (-5.9% YoY). The decline in tax revenue was also caused by tax administration factors, such as the implementation of the Average Effective Tariff (Tarif Efektif Rata-rata or TER) policy for PPh 21 and the relaxation of domestic VAT payments up to 10 days (until March 10, 2025) for tax reporting. State Expenditure Drops -7% YoY, Equivalent to 9.6% of Target. Deputy Minister of Finance, Suahasil Nazara, stated that state expenditure decreased by -7% YoY during 2M25 due to the high-base effect from high spending during late 2023 to early 2024 caused by El Nino. In addition, Suahasil also explained that President Prabowo Subianto's instruction regarding efficiency in ministry/agency spending up to 306.7 trillion rupiah aims to fund priority government programs, increase fiscal space for productive spending, and fund the vision and mission programs of new regional heads. Deficit Arrives Earlier, Reaching 0.13% of GDP. With this progress, the State Budget has recorded a deficit of 31.2 trillion rupiah or 0.13% of GDP during 2M25, marking an earlier deficit compared to the previous year (vs. February 2024: surplus of 0.11% of GDP). This is the first time the State Budget has recorded a deficit in the first two months of the running year since 2021, according to a Bloomberg report. Budget Financing Reaches 35.7% of Target. Sri Mulyani also conveyed that there was a significant issuance early in the year, resulting in budget financing reaching 220.1 trillion rupiah (vs. 2025 State Budget target: 616.2 trillion rupiah). Nevertheless, this progress is similar to the realization as of February 2024, which reached 35.4% of the 2024 State Budget target. When closing the press conference, Sri Mulyani opened the possibility that the State Budget realization briefing could be skipped in certain months due to internal considerations related to data. Besides issues related to the State Budget, Bloomberg reported that there are rumors President Prabowo is preparing a cabinet reshuffle, which might involve Sri Mulyani. Spokesperson at the Presidential Communication Office, Phillips J. Vermonte, declined to comment on the issue, but emphasized that President Prabowo has the prerogative right to conduct a reshuffle. Sri Mulyani herself declined to comment to several national media outlets regarding this issue on Wednesday (12/3). Key Takeaway: The risk of the State Budget deficit widening is one of the investors' concerns, which also impacts the weak rupiah exchange rate. Since the beginning of the year, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar has weakened by -2% YTD to the level of 16,425, even though in the same period the DXY index fell -4.4% YTD to the level of 103.7. A weak exchange rate can narrow the space for Bank Indonesia to lower interest rates, even though the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts has increased recently in line with investor concerns about potential US recession due to the trade war. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg consensus projects Bank Indonesia will cut interest rates by another 50 bps until the end of 2025.",
