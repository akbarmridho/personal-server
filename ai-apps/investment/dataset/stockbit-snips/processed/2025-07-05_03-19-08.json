      "title": "2025 State Budget Target Revised: Deficit Widens, Economic Growth Slows",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance reported the realization of the State Budget up to 1H25 in a working meeting with the DPR Budget Committee on Tuesday (1/7). Here are some important points from the presentation:\nState Revenue Drops Pressed by Weakening Tax Receipts\nState revenue during 1H25 fell -9% YoY, equivalent to 40% of the 2025 State Budget target (vs. 1H24: 47%). This achievement was slightly better than the -11% YoY drop in 5M25, mainly due to the achievement for June 2025 which started to show positive growth at a double digit rate year-on-year. Tax revenue fell -7% YoY during 1H25, an improvement compared to the realization of 5M25 which declined -10%.\nAccording to the Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, the contraction in state revenue during 1H25 was generally caused by weakening commodity prices, the transfer of SOE dividends to Danantara Capital Injection, and the cancellation of the implementation of 12% VAT (except for luxury goods).\nState Expenditure Begins to Increase\nMeanwhile, state expenditure during 1H25 grew by approximately +0.6% YoY and reached 39% of the 2025 State Budget target (vs. 1H24: 42%). This achievement increased compared to the -11% YoY drop realized in 5M25. The acceleration of state expenditure was mainly driven by the reopening of budget blocks following efficiency initiatives. The realization of government revenue and expenditure during 1H25 resulted in a deficit of IDR 204.2 trillion or equivalent to 0.84% of GDP (vs. 1H24: 0.34%).\nSri Mulyani conveyed that the outlook for the State Budget deficit until the end of 2025 is projected to reach IDR 662 trillion or equivalent to 2.78% of GDP, larger than the initial projection of IDR 616.2 trillion or 2.53% of GDP. To help cover the 2025 State Budget deficit, Sri Mulyani recently submitted a request to the DPR to use remaining budget balances (SAL) amounting to IDR 85.6 trillion.\nMeanwhile, the government also revised the 2025 macroeconomic assumptions after considering recent global economic dynamics and realizations during 1H25. The 2025 economic growth projection was revised down from +5.2% YoY to around +4.7-5% YoY. Other changes and assumptions for the 2026 R-APBN can be seen in the table above.\nKey Takeaway\nThe realization of the State Budget during 1H25 began to show an increase in June 2025, both from the state revenue side and the state expenditure side. The increase in state expenditure in 2H25 is one factor to support economic growth. In addition to the acceleration of state expenditure, another factor investors need to pay attention to is the result of the trade agreement between Indonesia and the US. The US government is scheduled to start announcing trade agreements with countries on Friday (4/7) with a deadline set for Wednesday (9/7).",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump said that the magnitude of new tariffs to be announced by the negotiation deadline on July 9, 2025, ranges from 10-70%. The upper limit of this range is higher than the maximum reciprocal tariff announced in April 2025 at 50%. Trump did not specify which countries would receive these tariffs, and it is still unknown whether certain goods will be subject to higher tariffs. Trump stated that the US government would send letters of new tariff determination to its trade partners starting Friday (4/7), with \"10 or 12 letters\" sent on Friday and the rest to follow in the coming days.\n2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that Indonesia will offer the US an increase in aircraft purchases by Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA) and wheat imports by Indofood Sukses Makmur ($INDF) as part of tariff negotiations. Furthermore, Airlangga mentioned that Indonesia is also offering tariffs between 0-5% for major US exports, depending on how high the tariffs imposed by the US on Indonesian import products will be. The Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, stated that the Indonesian government is asking the US to lower tariffs as much as possible for major Indonesian exports, including electronics, textiles, and footwear.\n3. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded that non-farm payrolls in the US increased by 147 thousand in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 144 thousand), exceeding the consensus expectation of 110 thousand. The unemployment rate in the US also dropped to 4.1% in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 4.2%), better than the consensus expectation of 4.3%. This result indicates that the US economy remains resilient, compared to expectations of economic turbulence and uncertainty due to President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Furthermore, a strong labor market reinforces the Fed's argument to maintain interest rates in order to suppress inflation.\n4. Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, said that the average utilization rate for the ceramic industry in 1H25 ranged between 70-71%, with production volume increasing +16.5% YoY to 218 million square meters. Although utilization improved compared to the 1H24 realization of 60%, the result is still below the 1H25 target of 75%. Edy also explained that ceramic demand is stagnant due to weakening public purchasing power, the slowdown in the property sector, and the fact that government projects have not been optimal. Additionally, Edy mentioned a new challenge in the form of a surge in ceramic imports from India, which is predicted to increase by +150% in 4M25 due to oversupply in India, and Indonesia's position being used as an alternate export market due to US tariffs.\n5. Reuters reported that the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association (APNI) urged the government to maintain the mining quota for 3 years to ensure a consistent business climate. APNI's appeal came after the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that the government plans to return the duration of the Work Plan and Budget (RKAB) from 3 years back to 1 year, which is intended to better control the supply of coal and ore. APNI stated that the discourse to shorten the quota duration could create hurdles in the approval process, considering thousands of miners would apply for quota permits every year. Furthermore, APNI mentioned that medium-term certainty is crucial for investment and operational planning.\n6. Minister of National Development Planning, Rachmat Pambudy, stated that his ministry estimates the recipients of the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program will jump significantly from 5.2 million people as of June 22, 2025, to 20 million people in August 2025. This aligns with the completion of officer training and kitchen facility readiness. The government aims for the MBG program recipients to reach 83 million people by the end of 2025. During 1H25, the Ministry of Finance recorded the budget realization for the MBG program at only IDR 5 trillion, reaching only about 7% of the total budget ceiling. The Head of the National Nutrition Agency, Dadan Hindayana, said they still need an additional IDR 50 trillion for November and December 2025.",
