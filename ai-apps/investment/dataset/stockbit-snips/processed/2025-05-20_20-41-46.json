      "title": "Rupiah Continues to Strengthen, Projected to Break Below 16,000",
      "content": "The Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar strengthened again by +0.1% to the level of 16,415 today, Tuesday (20/5), following news that the State Budget (APBN) recorded a surplus in 4M25 after experiencing a deficit during 1Q25. Today's strengthening means the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar has rebounded by +2.8% since its lowest level of 16,870 on April 24, 2025. The recent strengthening trend of the Rupiah exchange rate is occurring alongside improving global sentiment from the de-escalation of the trade war and the weakening trend of the US Dollar. Improved global sentiment is also reflected in the JCI's increase of +18.3% as of May 20, 2025, from its lowest closing level of 5,996 on April 8, 2025, driven by the return of foreign inflow. Bloomberg reported that a number of analysts expect the strengthening trend of the Rupiah to continue, mainly driven by the weakness of the US Dollar and expectations of more prudent Indonesian fiscal management. The weakening of the US Dollar itself is suppressed by weak US economic data and investor concerns about the condition of US government debt, which causes investors to exit the US market as a form of portfolio diversification. TD Securities projects the Rupiah has the potential to strengthen by more than +4% in 4Q25 compared to the closing of the stock exchange on Friday (16/5) at the level of 16,440. Meanwhile, Citigroup Global Markets estimates the Rupiah exchange rate will strengthen to the range of 16,000 by 2026. ING Financial Markets has the most bullish projection, expecting the Rupiah to appreciate up to the level of 15,200 by the end of 2025. A stronger Rupiah exchange rate provides greater room for Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate. According to the Reuters consensus, Bank Indonesia will cut the BI Rate by 25 bps to the level of 5.5% at the Board of Governors Meeting on Wednesday (21/5). Furthermore, the consensus also expects the BI Rate to drop again by another 25 bps to the level of 5.25% by the end of 3Q25. Key Takeaway: With the prospect of a strengthening Rupiah amidst an early stage of foreign inflow trend, we assess there is room for further JCI increase, thus investors can stay invested. The increase in JCI driven by foreign inflow will generally have a positive impact on the Big 4 Banks, namely BBCA, BMRI, BBNI, BBRI. Furthermore, the strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate will positively impact the performance of issuers with a large import portion, such as ICBP, KLBF, and MAPI.",

      "content": "1. The Ministry of Finance on Tuesday (20/5) released the Macroeconomic Framework and Fiscal Policy Outline (KEM-PPKF) for the 2026 fiscal year, which will be used in formulating the 2026 Draft State Budget (APBN). In the KEM-PPKF 2026, the government targets economic growth around +5.2-5.8% YoY, inflation around 1.5-3.5%, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar around 16,500-16,900, a State Budget deficit around 2.48-2.53% of GDP, Indonesian Crude Price in the range of 60-80 US dollars per barrel, oil lifting around 600,000-605,000 barrels per day, and gas lifting around 953 MBOEPD-1.017 MMBOEPD. 2. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated on Tuesday (20/5) that the State Budget recorded a surplus of 4.3 trillion Rupiah or 0.02% of GDP during 4M25, with a primary balance surplus of 173.9 trillion Rupiah (-26.7% YoY). This result marks a turnaround after a deficit of 104.2 trillion Rupiah in 1Q25, equivalent to 0.43% of GDP. State revenue in 4M25 reached 810.5 trillion Rupiah (-12.4% YoY) or equivalent to 27% of the 2025 target, while state expenditure reached 806.2 trillion Rupiah (-5.1% YoY) or equivalent to 22.3% of the 2025 target. 3. Kontan reported that the Ministry of Finance will rotate Echelon I officials, with Lieutenant General TNI Djaka Budi Utama replacing Askolani as Director General of Customs. Besides Customs, Kontan also reported that Bimo Wijayanto will be appointed as Director General of Taxes, replacing Suryo Utomo. Kontan reported that Djaka and Bimo were directly selected by President Prabowo Subianto. Djaka currently serves as the main secretary at the State Intelligence Agency, while Bimo serves as an independent commissioner at Phapros (PEHA). 4. Petronas Vice President of Exploration, Mohd Redhani Abdul Rahman, stated on Tuesday (20/5) that the company is currently discussing with Pertamina and TotalEnergies to form a partnership to develop the Bobara oil block, West Papua. Redhani mentioned that discussions have been ongoing since last year, but no agreement has been signed yet. Petronas itself signed a production sharing contract with the Indonesian government last year to operate the Bobara block, which is estimated to have reserves of 6.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 5. China's central bank on Tuesday (20/5) cut the 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates by 10 bps each to 3% and 3.5%, respectively. This decision was in line with consensus expectations and marked the first loan prime rate cut since October 2024. This decision also followed monetary easing steps announced in early May 2025 to strengthen the economy and mitigate potential impacts from trade tensions with the US. 6. China's national statistics bureau noted that the urban youth unemployment rate (aged 16-24) dropped to 15.8% in April 2025 (vs. March 2025: 16.5%). 7. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGEO) plans to add business activities in the form of laboratory testing services and commercialization of two-phase fluid measurement technology through a product branded 'Flow2Max.' This technology is capable of providing accurate and real-time data on two-phase conditions (steam-liquid), which is the main characteristic of geothermal fluids. This plan will be discussed at the AGM on June 3, 2025. 8. MNC Kapital Indonesia (BCAP) plans to conduct a rights issue of up to approximately 21.3 billion new shares with a dilution effect of up to 33.33%. The exercise price has not been announced, while the raised funds are intended for working capital and business development. This plan will be discussed at the EGM on June 25, 2025.",

Ade argued that the existing commission or service fee of 20% is used to finance various efforts to ensure the sustainability of order levels and revenue opportunities for driver partners, including promotions and discounts for customers, incentives, and driver travel insurance. Furthermore, regarding the demand to change the status of ojol from partners to laborers/employees, Ade asserted that the government recognizes Gojek driver partners as work partners and not employees.
