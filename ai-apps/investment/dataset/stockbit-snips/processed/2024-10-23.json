IMF Chief Economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas echoed the view, stating that China's fiscal stimulus so far lacks detail, and therefore the IMF did not incorporate it into its latest outlook. On 22 October, the IMF also revised down its outlook for China's 2024 growth to 4.8%, 0.2 percentage point lower than the July 2024 projection.",

      "content": "Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) recorded a significant decline in net profit to 543 billion rupiah, down 62% year-on-year (YoY) and 47% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in 3Q24. Consequently, net profit for the nine months ended 2024 (9M24) reached only 3 trillion rupiah, a 28% YoY decline, representing just 65% of the FY24 consensus estimate of 54 trillion rupiah. The weak net profit in 3Q24 was driven by lower revenue and weak margins.\n\n- Revenue fell as volume weakened: UNVR revenue in 3Q24 was 8.4 trillion rupiah, down 18% YoY and 7% QoQ, mainly due to a sharp 16% YoY decline in domestic sales volume. Revenue for 9M24 declined 10% YoY to 27.4 trillion rupiah. Management attributed the revenue drop to three factors: (1) reduction of stock in major channels; (2) disrupted distributor sales because of unstable and non-harmonised pricing across channels; and (3) ongoing impact of the boycott.\n\n- Operating profit margin collapsed: Operating profit margin fell sharply to 8.7% in 3Q24 (vs. 17.9% in 3Q23 and 14.6% in 2Q24). The margin compression was caused by (1) diseconomies of scale due to the significant volume decline; (2) transformation and/or restructuring initiatives that temporarily increased production costs; and (3) operating expense (OPEX) reduction that did not keep pace with revenue decline because advertising, research and promotion costs remained relatively high.\n\nGuidance: Management expects the various initiatives—stock adjustments, pricing harmonisation and transformation—to start showing results only in the second half of 2025.\n\nKey Takeaway: With the weak results, we expect consensus analysts to further cut UNVR performance estimates. In the past three months, FY24 net profit estimates have been reduced by 9%. The weak sales performance may be a positive signal for competitors such as Tempo Scan Pacific (TSPC). UNVR management disclosed that market share fell in 3Q24 to 34.9% by value (vs. 38.5% in 10M23 and 35.5% in 2Q24) and 28.4% by volume (vs. 31.7% in 10M23 and 29.0% in 2Q24).",
