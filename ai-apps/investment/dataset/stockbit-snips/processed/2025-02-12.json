      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) reported a decline in net profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 to 15.1 trillion rupiah, a decrease of 6.3 percent year‑on‑year and 1.8 percent quarter‑on‑quarter. The full‑year 2024 net profit amounted to 60.2 trillion rupiah, up 0.1 percent year‑on‑year, slightly below expectations at 98.5 percent of the consensus estimate. The performance was driven by: 1) Net Interest Margin (NIM) in line with guidance; 2) Cost of Credit (CoC) worse than guidance; and 3) credit growth below guidance. NIM fell to 7.4 percent in Q4 2024 (vs. 8.3 percent in Q4 2023 and 8.0 percent in Q3 2024), resulting in an average NIM of 7.74 percent for 2024 (vs. 8.2 percent in 2023), aligning with management guidance of 7.6‑8.0 percent. Loan yield rose to 13.2 percent in 2024 (vs. 13.1 percent in 2023), while cost of funds increased to 3.7 percent (vs. 3.1 percent in 2023). Management targets a slightly lower NIM of 7.3‑7.7 percent in 2025 and mentions a possible one‑off adjustment from modification loss that could affect NIM in the first half of 2025. CoC improved to 2.8 percent in Q4 2024 (vs. 2.2 percent in Q4 2023 and 3.2 percent in Q3 2024), but the annual CoC rose to 3.2 percent in 2024 (vs. 2.4 percent in 2023), above the management target of below 3 percent. The higher CoC was also driven by credit growth below guidance, leading to a 41 percent year‑on‑year increase in provision expenses and flat net profit. Management targets CoC of 3‑3.2 percent in 2025 and foresees a possible CoC increase in Q1 2025 due to front‑load provisioning by subsidiaries and modification loss, with normalization expected in the second half of 2025. Asset quality improved: Loan‑at‑Risk fell to 10.7 percent in Q4 2024 (vs. 12.5 percent in Q4 2023 and 11.7 percent in Q3 2024), and Gross NPL decreased to 2.8 percent (vs. 3.0 percent in Q4 2023 and 2.9 percent in Q3 2024), meeting the management goal of NPL below 3 percent. Special Mention Loans are expected to rise in the first half of 2025, while micro and ultra‑micro segment NPL remain high. Credit growth was 7 percent year‑on‑year in 2024 (vs. 11.2 percent in 2023 and 8.2 percent in Q3 2024), below the guidance range of 10‑12 percent. Growth was driven by corporate loans (+24 percent year‑on‑year) and consumer loans (+10 percent year‑on‑year), with slower growth in micro (+2.7 percent) and small (‑0.7 percent) segments. Deposits grew only 0.5 percent year‑on‑year as the bank reduced time deposits, resulting in a loan‑to‑deposit ratio of 88.9 percent in 2024 (vs. 84.2 percent in Q4 2023). Management targets credit growth of 7‑9 percent year‑on‑year in 2025. The dividend payout ratio for 2024 is planned at a minimum of 85 percent (vs. 80 percent in 2023), implying an approximate dividend yield of 8.3 percent based on the share price of 4,030 rupiah on 12 February 2025.",
