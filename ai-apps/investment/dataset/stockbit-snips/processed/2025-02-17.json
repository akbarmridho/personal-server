However, based on our calculations the buyback funding is relatively small compared with the free‑float market capitalisation of the three banks, so we believe the longer‑term price movement of the big state‑owned banks will remain more driven by the companies’ fundamental performance.",

The regulation also allows exporters to use the retained DHE in a special account for: 1) conversion to rupiah in the same bank for operating needs; 2) payment of taxes, state revenue and other government obligations; 3) dividend payments in foreign currency; 4) procurement of goods and services not available domestically; and 5) repayment of foreign‑currency loans for capital goods.",
