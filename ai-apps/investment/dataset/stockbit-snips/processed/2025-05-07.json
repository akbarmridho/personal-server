      "content": "Brent crude futures for the July 2025 contract rose 3.1% to $62.15 per barrel at the close of trade on Tuesday, May 6, after a sharp sell-off driven by concerns of oversupply from the OPEC+ production increase scheduled for June 2025, which had pushed Brent down to $60.23 per barrel on Monday, May 5, marking the lowest level since February 2021. The price rebound on Tuesday was likely triggered by trader buying as the market entered an oversold technical territory. The rally was also supported by indications of higher demand from China and Europe, a decline in U.S. crude inventories, and heightened geopolitical tension in the Middle East following an Israeli strike on a major airport in Yemen. Reuters reported that Chinese consumer sentiment strengthened after consumer spending during the May Day holiday rose 8% YoY. The May Day holiday is one of the longest holidays in China and is often used as a consumer-confidence gauge. Meanwhile, LSEG I/B/E/S data project European companies to post a net profit growth of +0.4% YoY in 1Q25, up from a prior estimate of ‚Äì1.7% YoY and the ‚Äì3.5% YoY estimate after the Trump-tariff announcement. Analysts surveyed by Reuters expect U.S. crude inventories for the week ending May 2 to fall by 800,000 barrels; if realised, this would be the first two-week consecutive draw since January 2025. Following this news, several oil-related stocks and service providers rose on Wednesday, May 7, with $MEDC up 1.44%, $ENRG up 5.15%, $ELSA up 0.85%, $WINS up 1.68% and $LEAD up 2.3%.",
