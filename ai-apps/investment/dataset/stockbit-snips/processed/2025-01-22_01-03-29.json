      "title": "DHE SDA Revision: 100% Portion for 1 Year",
      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Tuesday (21/1) that the government will revise the regulation on the placement of export proceeds from natural resources (DHE SDA) to mandate 100% placement for 1 year. This portion and tenor of placement is larger and longer compared to the existing regulation, which requires a minimum of 30% for 3 months. Airlangga said that the revision of the DHE SDA placement regulation will be effective starting March 1, 2025, for SDA exporters with an export value of at least 250,000 US dollars. Airlangga also mentioned that the revision of this regulation is currently in the harmonization stage and will be issued shortly. Airlangga claimed that the government will provide many incentives for the mineral and coal sectors as well as other natural resources, except for the oil and natural gas sector. These incentives include: - 0% WHT rate on interest income from DHE SDA placement instruments. - Exporters can utilize DHE SDA placement instruments as back-to-back collateral for rupiah credit from banks or the Investment Management Institution (LPI) for domestic rupiah needs. - Exporters can utilize swap instruments with banks if they need rupiah for their business activities. - Provision of guaranteed funds - including collateral in the form of cash collateral, current accounts, up to savings deposits - meeting certain requirements will be excluded from the maximum credit provision limit (BMPK), so that fund provision using DHE SDA placement instruments as collateral will not affect the gearing ratio against equity. - DHE SDA can be converted into rupiah and will be calculated as a reduction in the mandatory placement percentage. - Foreign exchange instruments can be used for payment of state levies such as taxes, royalties, and dividends. The revision of the DHE SDA placement regulation itself is aimed at increasing domestic foreign exchange supply to alleviate pressure on the rupiah. As of Tuesday (21/1), the rupiah to US dollar exchange rate had fallen -0.9% MoM to the level of 16,335. Airlangga claimed that the revision of DHE SDA placement could increase state foreign exchange reserves by up to 90 billion US dollars, equivalent to 58% of the 2024 realization of 156 billion US dollars. Nevertheless, the regulation revision has been criticized by exporters. Before Airlangga announced the revision changes for DHE SDA placement, the General Chairman of the Indonesian Exporters Association, Benny Soetrisno, stated on Monday (20/1) that the revised regulation would disrupt exporter finances, given that export dollars must be placed domestically while exporter financing has mostly originated from foreign financial institutions. To ease the burden on exporters, Airlangga mentioned last week that the yield interest rate on term deposits for DHE SDA placement will be higher than in Singapore, which is in the range of 4.12-4.48%, although he did not elaborate further. Last week, Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, also mentioned that Bank Indonesia is preparing SUVBI and SVBI as additional instruments for DHE SDA placement, besides existing instruments such as foreign exchange term deposits and FX swaps. Key Takeaway: At first glance, the revision of the DHE SDA placement regulation has the potential to provide a positive sentiment for banking issuers along with the addition of foreign exchange liquidity. Meanwhile, there is a risk of operational working capital liquidity for exporters who do not have a strong balance sheet (cash). However, further clarity and details regarding the incentives that exporters will receive are still needed to measure the impact of the DHE SDA rule change on exporters.",

The consensus forecasts that Indonesian CPO production will increase +1.9% YoY in 2025 to 49.8 million tons.
