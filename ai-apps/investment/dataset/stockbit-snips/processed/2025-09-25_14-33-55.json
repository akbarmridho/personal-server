      "title": "ü§ù RI Signs Trade Agreements with the European Union & Canada",
      "content": "Indonesia on Tuesday (9/23) signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA), which will eliminate tariffs for 80% of Indonesian products exported to the European Union, including palm oil, coffee, and textile products. In return, Indonesia will eliminate import duties on 98.5% of goods imported from the European Union and simplify entry procedures for products including cars and food products. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, targets the IEU-CEPA to take effect on January 1, 2027, where the government hopes exports to the European Union can double in the first 5 years of implementation. Nevertheless, Indonesia's nickel export ban - which is currently still in dispute at the WTO - remains in effect. Meanwhile, the EU's anti-deforestation regulation, which Indonesia opposes, was also not cancelled, although its implementation was postponed for 1 year until December 30, 2026. Even though the IEU-CEPA is targeted to take effect only on January 1, 2027, the General Chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association, Eddy Martono, said that his party expects Indonesian palm oil exports to the European Union to increase to 4 million tons in 2026 from an estimate of 3.3 million tons in 2025. This forecast is supported by the postponement of the EU's anti-deforestation regulation. In addition to the European Union, Indonesia on Wednesday (9/24) signed a trade agreement with Canada, which will provide better access for 90% of Indonesian export products to that country, including textiles, paper, processed food, and palm oil. Canada's Minister of International Trade, Maninder Sidhu, stated that this agreement is expected to open duty-free access for up to 95% of Canadian goods exported to Indonesia within the next 8-12 months, and is capable of doubling the trade value between the two countries in 6 years. In 2024, the total trade value between Indonesia-Canada reached 3.6 billion US dollars, while the trade between Indonesia-European Union was 30.1 billion US dollars, according to Reuters reports. The agreement with Indonesia is part of the efforts by Canada and the European Union to expand their reach into Asia. Reuters reports that Canada will sign a trade agreement with the Philippines shortly, and is considering similar steps with Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Meanwhile, Bloomberg mentions that the European Union is seeking trade agreements with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. As we previously wrote, sectorally, we see that the significance of this trade agreement for Indonesia lies in the textile sector, which absorbs a lot of labor. Meanwhile, the potential for increased demand from the trade agreement and the postponement of the EU's anti-deforestation regulation potentially gives a positive sentiment to the CPO sector.",

This result led the bank-only net profit for 8M25 to decline to 4.2 trillion rupiah (-3% YoY), equivalent to 60% of the 2025 F consensus estimate (vs. 8M24: 64% realization of consolidated net profit for 2024). The decline in net profit in August 2025 was caused by provisioning expenses rising +172% YoY, even though PPOP still grew +10% YoY. Meanwhile, performance during 8M25 was suppressed by a decline in PPOP (-5% YoY) due to increased opex (+2% YoY) and weakening Net Interest Income (-2% YoY), which was reflected in the decline of the bank-only Net Interest Margin (NIM) to 3.6% (vs. 8M24: 3.9%, 1H25: 3.5%). Provisioning expenses throughout 8M25 still decreased by -7% YoY, so the decline in net profit was not as deep as the decline in PPOP.",

Mistry also predicts CPO prices could rise to 5,500 ringgit per ton in 1Q26, potentially the highest level since June 2022. Mistry bases his projections on the end of the CPO production cycle, the ongoing government takeover of illegal palm oil plantations in Indonesia, the planned implementation of the B50 program by Indonesia next year, and high prices of substitute products such as oilseeds. Additionally, Mistry assesses that the Indonesian government's efforts in taking over illegal palm oil plantations could reduce CPO productivity, which is currently in a stagnation or even negative phase. Mistry also forecasts that CPO supply will only increase by 1 million tons in 2025-2026, lower than the previous year's level of 1.5 million tons.",
