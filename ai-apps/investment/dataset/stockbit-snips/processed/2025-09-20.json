      "content": "The legislative body (DPR) on Thursday, 18 September, approved 67 bills to be placed on the national legislative program (prolegnas) priority list for discussion in 2026. One of the laws to be reviewed is the State Finance Law, which sets the maximum budget deficit limit at 3% of GDP and the total debt ceiling at 60% of GDP. The Finance Minister, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, said that the current deficit and debt limits do not need to be changed. Reuters reported that 12 economists expect Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates more aggressively after an unexpected BI Rate reduction on Wednesday, 17 September, with the median forecast for the BI Rate at 4% in 2026. Previously, a Reuters survey of 21 economists projected the BI Rate at 4.5% in 2026. IDX Channel reported that Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa on Friday, 19 September, promised to pay more attention to the tobacco industry and emphasized that an overly aggressive tobacco excise tariff is an irresponsible policy. He also highlighted the rise of illegal cigarettes and ordered his team to monitor and eradicate illegal cigarette sales, including online sales. President Prabowo Subianto appointed the Deputy Minister of State-Owned Enterprises and COO of Danantara, Dony Oskaria, as acting Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, following the reassignment of Erick Thohir to the Minister of Youth and Sports. The National Nutrition Agency reported on Thursday, 18 September, that the actual absorption of the budget for the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program reached approximately 8.3 trillion rupiah, with a target of 10 trillion rupiah by October 2025. For context, the MBG program budget allocation for 2025 is 171 trillion rupiah, while the allocation for 2026 is 335 trillion rupiah.",

      "title": "Bank Mandiri 1H25 Net Profit Down 8% YoY, Below Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded a net profit of 11.3 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (down 19% YoY, down 15% QoQ). This result made the net profit for the first half of 2025 (1H25) reach 24.5 trillion rupiah, an 8% decline YoY, below expectations as it equals 44% of the 2025F consensus estimate (versus 48% actual in 1H24). The weak net profit performance was mainly caused by a surge in operating expenses (OPEX). After releasing the 1H25 performance, BMRI also adjusted several 2025 guidance items. OPEX increased by 35% YoY in 2Q25 and 25% YoY in 1H25, primarily due to a one-off adjustment from the company’s financial audit. Although the audit did not detail the cause, management said the adjustment represents 10-12% of the OPEX estimate for 2025F. Most of the adjustment was booked in June 2025, with the remainder to be recorded in the coming months. Overall, management expects OPEX for 2025F to grow roughly at the same rate as in 1H25 (+25% YoY). For 2026, OPEX is projected to be flat compared to 2025 in the base-case scenario, or to rise by a low single-digit percentage in the bear-case scenario. Outside OPEX, key operational metrics remain solid: Net Interest Income grew 8% YoY in 2Q25 and 7% YoY in 1H25, while provision expenses increased only modestly by 2% YoY in 2Q25 and 5% YoY in 1H25. Liquidity injection and 2025 guidance revision: Management revised down the 2025 guidance for credit growth and Net Interest Margin (NIM). Cost of Credit (CoC) is expected to improve compared with the previous guidance as asset quality – NPL and LAR – remains stable. The reduction in credit growth and NIM guidance accounts for the impact of a 55-trillion-rupiah liquidity injection from the government and the expectation that the BI Rate will be cut by another 50 basis points by the end of 2025. Management noted that further clarification from the government is needed regarding the rules for using the funds, such as the definition of real-sector coverage and permissible products, both on the asset and liability sides. Key Takeaway: Based on the overall guidance revisions, BMRI is expected to remain conservative and adopt a “wait and see” stance. Accelerated government spending is anticipated to boost demand, allowing banks in general – not only BMRI – to become more confident in expanding credit. A potential risk is if the government pushes for lower loan interest rates to stimulate demand, which could affect banking profitability.",

The result brought 1H25 net profit to 3.7 trillion rupiah, a 10% YoY increase, matching the 2025F consensus estimate of 47% (versus 48% actual in 1H24). Net Margin Income grew 24% YoY in 2Q25 and 15% YoY in 1H25. The Net Return rose to 5.7% in 1H25 (versus 5.3% in 1Q25 and 5.5% in 1H24), in line with management’s 2025 guidance of 5.5-5.9%. However, operating expenses expanded 23% YoY in 2Q25 and 20% YoY in 1H25, causing the PPOP growth to lag behind Net Margin Income growth (+13% YoY in 2Q25, +12% YoY in 1H25). Third-party funds growth slowed to 9% YoY in June 2025 (versus 11% YoY in 2024), while loan growth decelerated to 14% YoY (versus 16% YoY in 2024), pushing the Financing-to-Deposit Ratio to 91% (up from 85% in 2024), the highest level since 2020.",
