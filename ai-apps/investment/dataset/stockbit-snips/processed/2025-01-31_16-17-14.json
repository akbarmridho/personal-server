If there is no escalation in trade tariff policies from the US government - which could have implications for US inflation and interest rate prospects - we assess that there is still room for further strengthening in big bank stocks given their attractive valuations. Here are the 1-Year Forward P/B valuations for big banks as of Friday (31/1): BBRI: 1.89x (~1SD below the 10-year historical average), BMRI: 1.79x (~0.5SD above the 10-year historical average), BBNI: 1.02x (~0.5SD below the 10-year historical average), BBCA: 3.99x (~0.5SD above the 10-year historical average).",

Kontan reported that the government is prohibiting the sale of 3 kg liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) through retailers starting February 1, 2025. Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) Yuliot Tanjung said that retailers who wish to continue selling subsidized LPG must be registered as official bases or sub-distributors of Pertamina. Yuliot stated that this policy aims to ensure that the distribution of subsidized LPG is more on target. Additionally, a shorter distribution chain is expected to make the price of 3 kg LPG comply with government regulations.",

Indonesia itself has been a permanent member of BRICS since early 2025. US President Donald Trump stated on Thursday (30/1) that he would implement a 25% import tariff for Canada and Mexico starting February 1, 2025, along with a 10% import tariff for China. However, Trump mentioned that they have not determined whether the import tariffs will also cover oil commodities. Trump stressed that the tariffs are aimed at addressing the large number of undocumented migrants and narcotics crossing the US border, as well as the trade deficit with neighboring countries. The price of gold in the spot market rose +1.4% to the level of 2,796 US dollars per troy ounce on Thursday (30/1), marking an all-time high. This rise in gold prices was triggered by safe haven demand due to geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about global economic growth amidst US President Donald Trump's planned import tariff threats.",
