      "content": "The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, on Monday (6/1) announced that the 2024 State Budget (APBN) deficit reached 2.29% of GDP, in line with the initial target although higher than the 2023 APBN realization of 1.61% of GDP. This result is also lower than the Ministry of Finance's outlook in September 2024, which projected the 2024 APBN deficit to reach 2.7% of GDP. The better performance than that outlook was supported by easing oil price pressures, commodity price recovery, low and contained inflation, and the recovery of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar.",

      "content": "Although already projected to increase this year, the 2025 APBN deficit has the potential to be higher than expected following the cancellation of the VAT increase for general goods and services and the launch of the 2025 stimulus package. However, this risk could subside if these policies succeed in providing a positive impact on community consumption, thus still increasing total nominal tax revenue. Furthermore, the implementation of Coretax is also expected to increase overall tax revenue. Successfully maintaining the budget deficit has the potential to stabilize the Rupiah exchange rate - especially amid global uncertainties such as geopolitics, the direction of The Fed's interest rates, and the new US government's policies.",

      "content": "Although still growing, total tax receipts were the only account in the 2024 APBN that did not meet the target, mainly due to the contraction in tax receipts in 1H24. This result was pressured by a significant decrease in corporate income tax (-18% YoY) due to decreased profitability of coal and palm oil sector companies following commodity price moderation in 1H24. On the other hand, transactional tax receipts experienced solid growth, such as Income Tax Article 21 (+21% YoY) and VAT/Luxury Goods Sales Tax (+8.6% YoY), supported by wage and THR payments. In the same occasion, Sri Mulyani also mentioned that the Ministry of Finance estimates Indonesia's economic growth during 2024 to be in the range of +5% YoY (vs. 2023: +5.05% YoY), in line with consensus estimates although lower than the government target of +5.2% YoY. BPS has not yet released economic growth data for 4Q24. For 2025, the government targets the 2025 APBN deficit to be 2.53% of GDP, alongside state spending (+8.1% YoY) which is growing higher than state revenue (+5.7% YoY).",

      "content": "The Brazilian government announced on Monday (6/1) that Indonesia will become a full member of BRICS. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Tuesday (7/1) that the Indonesian government welcomes the announcement, adding that BRICS membership is a strategic way to enhance collaboration and partnership with other developing nations. Besides Indonesia, current full BRICS members consist of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Indonesia's entry as a full member comes amidst threats from US President-elect Donald Trump, who stated he would impose a 100% tariff on BRICS member countries if the group acts to weaken the US Dollar. The government officially set the retirement age for workers in Indonesia to 59 years as of 2025. This provision - regulated in Article 251 of Government Regulation No. 45/2015 - applies to workers wanting to withdraw their Pension Guarantee program benefits managed by BPJS Ketenagakerjaan. The regulation stipulates that the retirement age in Indonesia was initially set at 56 years, before increasing to 57 years as of 2019 and will continue to increase by 1 year every 3 years until reaching the maximum retirement age limit of 65 years. The Constitutional Court on Friday (3/1) ruled that the norm in Article 251 of the Commercial Code is conditionally unconstitutional. Consequently, insurance companies can no longer unilaterally cancel claims. Insurance observer Wahyudin Rahman mentioned that the ruling will have a significant impact on the insurance industry, such as the possibility of insurance companies facing more claim disputes. Meanwhile, the Deputy President Director of Asuransi Cakrawala Proteksi Indonesia, Nicolaus Prawiro, stated that the ruling requires insurance companies to be more meticulous in business acceptance. The Director of PT Astra Daihatsu Motor, Sri Agung Handayani, stated that the selling price of Daihatsu brand low cost green cars (LCGC) has increased as of January 2025 along with the VAT increase to 12% and the implementation of motorized vehicle tax surcharges. Besides Daihatsu, Marketing Director of PT Toyota Astra Motor, Anton Jimmi Suwandy, mentioned that Toyota LCGC cars also experienced a price increase for the same reason. Bulog raised the target for domestic rice procurement from 1.27 million tons in 2024 to 3 million tons in 2025. Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, stated that Indonesia will not import rice in 2025 by optimizing domestic procurement during the peak harvest months of March-May. For comparison, Indonesia imported more than 3.7 million tons of rice in 2024. Reuters reported that Indonesian rice production is expected to increase from 30.34 million tons in 2024 to 32.8 million tons in 2025. The Minister of Trade, Budi Santoso, stated that the government targets Indonesia's export value in 2025 to grow +7.1% YoY to 294.45 billion USD or 4,770 trillion Rupiah. Budi also mentioned that they have calculated the required export value targets for 2025-2029 to support the economic growth target of +8% in 2029 as decreed by President Prabowo Subianto. To achieve this target, the Ministry of Trade targets an export value of 315.31 billion USD in 2026, 340.2 billion USD in 2027, 370.04 billion USD in 2028, and 405.69 billion USD in 2029. The Minister of Transportation, Dudy Purwagandhi, stated that the number of people traveling intra and inter-province across Indonesia during the Christmas and New Year period from December 18, 2024, to January 5, 2025, was 94.67 million people, a decrease of -24.92% YoY. Based on a survey conducted by the Ministry of Transportation, factors causing this travel decrease include weather conditions, lack of permits, insufficient funds, and the proximity of the Eid al-Fitr holiday in March 2025. The Director General of Customs and Excise of the Ministry of Finance, Askolani, stated that the government will still consider the national economic conditions in 1H25 before implementing excise duties on Prepackaged Sweetened Drinks (MBDK). The government targets revenue from MBDK excise duties to be 3.8 trillion Rupiah in 2025. The Deputy Minister of Finance, Suahasil Nazara, stated that the 2024 APBN budget realization for IKN development reached 43.4 trillion Rupiah, equivalent to 97.3% of the total ceiling of 44.5 trillion Rupiah. This result brings the total IKN development budget realization from APBN during 2022-2024 to 75.8 trillion Rupiah. The IKN development itself requires a cost of 466 trillion Rupiah, with the total financing from the APBN estimated to only reach 89.4 trillion Rupiah.",
