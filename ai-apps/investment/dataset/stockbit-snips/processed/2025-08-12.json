      "content": "President of the United States, Donald Trump, on Monday (11/8) extended the pause on the implementation of tariffs on goods originating from China for 90 days until 10 November 2025, a move that could ease concerns over a tariff war and give both countries more time to negotiate further. Previously, in June 2025, China and the United States had reached a trade framework agreement. Bloomberg reported that if Trump does not extend the pause, tariffs on Chinese goods to the United States would rise by at least 54% on Tuesday (12/8) early morning local time.",
