      "content": "NCKL 9M24: Net profit increased 8.4% year-on-year, surpassing expectations. Trimegah Bangun Persada (NCKL) recorded its highest quarterly net profit since IPO in 3Q24, with realization of 2 trillion rupiah (+12.6% quarter-on-quarter, +18.2% year-on-year). This result brought net profit for the first nine months of 2024 to 4.8 trillion rupiah (+8.4% YoY), beating expectations as it equals 93%/91% of the FY24 Stockbit/consensus estimate. Operationally, revenue in 3Q24 grew 11.9% QoQ while cost of goods sold rose more moderately (+3.7% QoQ), leading to gross margin improvement to 37.5% (vs. 2Q24: 32.6%). In addition, operating expenses fell 7.3% QoQ, driving operating profit growth of 35.5% QoQ. Quarterly margin improvement was driven by: 1) higher limonite sales as the HPAL smelter owned by the company's subsidiary PT Obi Nickel Cobalt started operating; and 2) higher ferronickel (FeNi) selling price. Volume of limonite ore sales increased 69.3% QoQ, 103.2% YoY in 3Q24, driven by the start of operations of the HPAL smelter of PT Obi Nickel Cobalt in August 2024. The sales are not eliminated because NCKL's ownership in PT Obi Nickel Cobalt is only 10%. Volume of FeNi production was relatively stable (-1.8% QoQ, +3.0% YoY) in 3Q24, with sales volume rising (+2.5% QoQ, +3.6% YoY). FeNi selling price was US$11,921 per ton (+4.8% QoQ, -7.7% YoY), with cash cost of US$8,353 per ton (+3.7% QoQ, -9.8% YoY). In the earnings call on Friday (22/11), management announced that the company started producing electrolytic cobalt – a derivative of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) – with capacity of 6,000 tons per year and began exporting in August 2024. This product sells at a higher price of US$22,047 per ton (vs. cobalt sulfate US$17,031 per ton) with a lower cash cost of US$8,308 per ton (vs. cobalt sulfate US$9,020 per ton) for 9M24. Electrolytic cobalt also has the same conversion ratio as MHP to cobalt sulfate. Key takeaway: management expects 4Q24 operational performance to be relatively stable compared with 3Q24, and therefore we assess that FY24 and FY25 performance estimates should be revised upward. On the day’s trading, NCKL shares rose 3.09% to 835 rupiah per share. Based on existing estimates, NCKL trades at a forward 1-year P/E of 8.02x, below its historical average of 8.4x.",
