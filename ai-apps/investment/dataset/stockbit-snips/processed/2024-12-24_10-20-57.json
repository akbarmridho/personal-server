      "content": "Reuters reported that the Chinese government has agreed to issue special treasury bonds worth 3 trillion yuan in 2025. This bond issuance is an all-time high and is intended to provide fiscal stimulus in an effort to revive the weakening Chinese economy. The Executive Director of the Indonesia Mining Association expressed objections to the government's plan to increase Export Proceeds (DHE) to 60%. This objection is accompanied by the consideration that the average selling price (ASP) of coal has experienced a significant decline. Furthermore, holders of Special Mining Business Permits (IUPK) in the coal industry are also subject to a progressive royalty rate of 28%. The government through the Ministry of Finance (Kemenkeu) will allocate 28.2 trillion rupiah for the procurement of 220,000 units of Housing Financing Liquidity Facility (FLPP) quota in 2025. The Commissioner of the Housing Provident Fund Management Agency (BP Tapera), Heru Pudyo Nugroho, stated that the distribution of FLPP will still use the existing scheme, which is 75:25. 75% of the funds will be subsidized from the State Budget (APBN), while the remaining 25% is allocated from banking. However, this allocation is still below the proposal of the Minister of Housing, Maruarar Sirait, who targeted the FLPP quota to reach 300,000 to 500,000 units. For information, the channeling of FLPP in 2025 can commence in January. The Head of the National Nutrition Agency, Dadan Hindayana, revealed that not all school children in the free nutritious meal (MBG) program will receive milk in their menu. Dadan explained that milk distribution will be focused first in dairy farming centers areas. As an alternative, children will receive other side dishes such as eggs for protein needs and moringa leaves for calcium. The Chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Ahmad Muzani, conveyed that the government has the opportunity to review the application of the 12% Value Added Tax (PPN) on luxury goods which will start in January 2025. According to Muzani, this discussion will take place if the tax increase impacts the micro-economy sector.",

      "title": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) 11M24: Net Profit +4.7% YoY, Credit Cost Maintained",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded net profit (bank only) of 4.1 trillion rupiah (-9.7% YoY, +1.4% MoM) in November 2024. This result causes the bank only net profit for 11M24 to grow to 47.2 trillion rupiah (+4.7% YoY), above the consolidated FY24 growth estimate consensus at +2% YoY level. On the negative side, Net Interest Margin (NIM) and Non-Interest Income (NII) weakened. Meanwhile, on the positive side, credit cost (CoC) was maintained and credit growth remained strong. NIM in November 2024 weakened to 4.4% (-22 bps YoY, -17 bps MoM), so NIM for 11M24 decreased to 4.6% (-32 bps YoY). This result is below management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of 5-5.3%. On the other hand, Non-II was recorded at 2.5 trillion rupiah (-19% YoY, -4.5% MoM) in November 2024, causing Non-II growth for 11M24 to slow down to +2% YoY (vs 11M23: +15% YoY, 10M24: +4.6% YoY). Due to the weakening of Non-II, the company's Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) was suppressed to 5.4 trillion rupiah (-2.6% YoY, -5.1% MoM) in November 2024. Nevertheless, PPOP performance for 11M24 is still categorized as good at 64.9 trillion rupiah (+6.1% YoY). BMRI CoC was at 0.3% (+28 bps YoY, -61 bps MoM) in November 2024. This result keeps CoC for 11M24 maintained at 0.7%, better than management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of <=1%. The annual increase in CoC is caused by a low-base effect in November 2023. BMRI recorded credit growth of +22.7% YoY in 11M24 (vs 11M23: +14% YoY, 10M24: +22.5% YoY), higher than management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of 16-18%. On the other hand, third-party funds (DPK) grew +15% YoY (vs 11M23, +6% YoY, 10M24: +13% YoY) during 11M24. Although slowing down, BMRI's Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) remained relatively high at 93.9% (vs 11M23: 87.7%, 10M24: 95.1%) in November 2024, one of the highest among other big banks. Key Takeaway: We assess the bank only performance of BMRI in November 2024 as quite good, especially from the company's success in maintaining CoC which indicates asset quality is maintained. Although NIM weakened, investors need to note that BMRI's consolidated NIM tends to be supported by subsidiary NIMs. On the other hand, BMRI's liquidity is considered tight compared to other big banks, so there is limited potential for future credit growth space and a risk of increasing cost of fund due to competition in growing DPK.",
