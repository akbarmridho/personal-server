      "title": "US Stock Market Plummets Under Recession Concerns",
      "content": "The US stock market continued its weakening, with the Nasdaq index down 4.8% week-over-week, the S&P 500 down 3.6% week-over-week, and the DJIA down 2.6% week-over-week on Tuesday (11 March). This decline extends the weakening trend that has been ongoing for the past two weeks, driven by investor worries about a potential US recession due to the trade war. Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News that the firm has now raised the probability of a US recession to 35%. In response to the US market decline, US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday (11 March) that the public cannot only watch the stock market, a statement contrary to his usual tendency to use market rallies as proof of his success. Trump also warned of possible turmoil during the \"transition period\" of his administration, because his government aims to do \"something big\" to bring wealth back into the US. Trump has repeatedly vacillated on implementing his tariff policy, creating global market uncertainty. Most recently, Trump on Tuesday (11 March) threatened to double import tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium to 50% after the province of Ontario announced a plan to levy an additional fee on electricity shipped to the US. The tariff-doubling proposal was cancelled by Trump only a few hours after it was announced, following the cancellation of Ontario's authority to impose the extra electricity fee. Meanwhile, the European Union announced on Wednesday (12 March) that the region will soon impose counter-tariffs on US imports worth 28 billion US dollars. This move follows the US government's implementation of a 25% import tariff on steel and aluminium commodities on the same day. The EU said it will end the suspension of US import tariffs for the 2018-2020 period on 1 April 2025 and will apply full US import tariffs on 13 April 2025, but remains open to negotiations because higher tariffs would not benefit anyone. Key Takeaway: The risk of a US recession could pressure the global economy and negatively affect Indonesia's trade balance through lower exports. Conversely, a weakening US economy could give the Federal Reserve more room to cut US interest rates, which could be followed by a reduction of the BI Rate by Bank Indonesia. The Fed rate-cut outlook has recently improved, with analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool showing the probability of a US rate cut of more than 50 basis points by the end of 2025 rising to 65.8% today from 60.9% a week earlier. Additionally, a deteriorating US economic outlook could trigger capital outflows from the US to other countries offering better growth prospects.",

The amendment discussion will focus on expanding civilian posts for TNI personnel from 10 ministries/agencies to 15 ministries/agencies. Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin said the draft amendment requires soldiers to resign from the TNI before taking civilian positions. According to DPR member TB Hasanuddin, the new draft differs from the previous draft that allowed active TNI personnel to fill any government position. The TNI law revision comes amid a trend of placing active and retired TNI officers in state-owned enterprises during President Prabowo Subianto's term. Earlier this month, Tempo reported that President Prabowo gathered hundreds of TNI colonels in Hambalang, West Java, for courses at SBM ITB, FEB UI, and Universitas Prasetya Mulya.
