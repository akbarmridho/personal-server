      "title": "Coal Production Has Exceeded Government Target",
      "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources noted that national coal production reached 711.37 million tons as of November 15, 2024, already exceeding the 2024 target set by the government, which aimed for 710 million tons. The 2024 production target itself is 2.2% higher than the 2023 target of 695 million tons. The Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, Gita Mahyarani, predicted that national coal production throughout 2024 will be around 800 million tons, 3.2% higher compared to the 2023 realization of 775 million tons. Out of the national coal production as of November 15, 2024, as much as 50.6% or 359 million tons were sold to export markets, equivalent to 69.3% of the 2023 export realization. The strong national coal production up to mid-November 2024 is also reflected in the production volume of coal producer issuers during 9M24. The details are as follows: ADRO: 55.6 million tons (+9.5% YoY); ITMG: 15 million tons (+11.1% YoY); PTBA: 33 million tons (+3.4% YoY); BUMI (as of 1H24): 37.7 million tons (+7% YoY). Key Takeaway: Solid coal production potentially indicates a positive signal for coal supporting issuers such as UNTR and DOID (mining contractors) and TPMA (coal logistics). On the other hand, the strong coal production in Indonesia potentially has a negative impact on coal prices if not balanced by demand, especially considering the risk of China's still weak economy, which is the target of tariffs from the US President-elect, Donald Trump.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that analysts see Bank Indonesia likely carrying out slower and fewer reference interest rate cuts due to global uncertainty endangering the stability of the Rupiah. Most analysts predict Bank Indonesia will take a longer pause on rate cuts due to geopolitical tensions and the prospect of protectionist policies from the Donald Trump administration, which risks delaying Fed rate easing and spurring investor demand for safe-haven assets like the US dollar. Bloomberg mentioned that some analysts still expect Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate in December 2024, but most analysts anticipate Bank Indonesia will wait until 2025 to resume rate cuts. Furthermore, Bloomberg Economics does not rule out the possibility that Bank Indonesia could reverse course and raise interest rates within the next 12 months if financial market volatility worsens.",

This result was pressured by a decline in revenue (-10% YoY, -47% QoQ), mostly from a decrease in revenue recognition from the development segment (-26% YoY, -61% QoQ) following a drop in the housing sub-segment (-39% YoY, -67% QoQ). Note that the quarterly performance of a property issuer may increase or decrease sharply, depending on revenue recognition. Meanwhile, net profit during 9M24 reached IDR 934 billion (+43% YoY), equivalent to 87% of the consensus FY24F estimate. SMRA recorded strong revenue recognition growth during 9M24 (+49% YoY), as well as gross profit margin expansion (+240 bps YoY) and operating profit margin expansion (+630 bps YoY).
