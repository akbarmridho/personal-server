      "title": "Government Pilots Village Cooperatives Starting July 19, 2025",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, stated that the trial run for the Red and White Village Cooperatives (Kopdes) will begin on July 19, 2025 - delayed from the initial plan on July 12, 2025 - with an official operational schedule set for October 28, 2025. This trial will involve approximately 100 cooperatives that have met the requirements to act as a mockup. Regarding funding, Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Ferry Juliantono, stated that members of the state-owned bank association (Himbara) are obligated to provide a credit ceiling of up to 3 billion rupiah per cooperative with an interest rate of 6% under the Red and White Village Cooperative credit scheme. This loan has a tenor of 6 years for working capital needs and 10 years for investment purposes. Nevertheless, the regulation concerning the financing of the Red and White Village Cooperatives has not yet been officially released by the government. The number of Red and White Village Cooperatives that have obtained legal entity status as of mid-2025 has reached 74,877 units or equivalent to 93% of the 80,480 formed Village Cooperative units, according to Zulkifli. Thus, the total funds potentially disbursed by Himbara reached 241 trillion rupiah. Details of the credit distribution quota by each bank will be coordinated by the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, where Kontan reported that the disbursement of credit for the Red and White Village Cooperatives is proposed using the 2025 KUR ceiling. The following is the KUR allocation for several State-Owned Banks for 2025: Zulkifli mentioned that the loan ceiling can be used starting July 1, 2025, although funding will only be disbursed if the Village Cooperative has a mature business plan. Meanwhile, Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated that village funds will serve as collateral in case of default by the cooperative. Previously, Himbara's involvement in the Village Cooperatives drew attention from observers regarding the risk of non-performing loans, especially amid the slowdown in the MSME sector. For context, Bank Indonesia noted that the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) for the MSME sector rose from 3.76% at the end of 2024 to a level of 4.36% during 4M25. The Red and White Village Cooperative itself is a cooperative formed as part of the government's effort to strengthen the village economy, including the development of outlets covering daily necessities, village pharmacies, village clinics, lending and borrowing business units, logistics, and cold storage. Key Takeaway: We assess that the execution and management of this program are factors that investors need to monitor. Because, although guaranteed by village funds, problems arising from this program could create uncertainty for the banking sector. Meanwhile, the potential pressure on banks' Net Interest Margin will depend on how large the mandated funding is, namely whether the credit for Red and White Village Cooperatives will reduce the KUR allocation or if there will be additions outside the existing allocation.",

The Gunawan family and ANZ collectively hold an 86% stake in PNBN.
