      "title": "BBCA 10M24: Net Profit +15% YoY, Loan Growth Continues to Strengthen",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded a net profit (bank only) of 5.9 trillion rupiah (+34% MoM, +19% YoY) in October 2024. This result brings the net profit (bank only) over 10M24 to grow to 46.2 trillion rupiah (+15% YoY). This performance was driven by: 1) continued strengthening of loan growth; 2) renewed increase in Net Interest Margin (NIM); and 3) reversal of provision expenses.\n\n- Loan Growth Continues to Strengthen\n\nBBCA's bank-only loans grew +14.2% YoY during 10M24, exceeding management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of 10-12%. This increase is higher compared to the growth of third-party funds (DPK) which was only +2.7% YoY, causing the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) to increase to the 78% level. However, the company's LDR is still lower compared to other big banks (bank only). For comparison, as of September 2024, the LDR for BMRI reached 93.7%, BBRI 89.6%, and BBNI 95.3%.\n\n- NIM Increases Again\n\nBBCA managed to record a NIM of 5.93% in October 2024 (+18 bps MoM, +39 bps YoY), marking the second highest monthly level since at least 2022. This result brought the NIM over 10M24 up to the 5.7% level (+21 bps YoY), in line with management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of 5.7-5.8%. This NIM increase was driven by the shift in asset mix composition towards higher yield assets, one of which came from placements in Bank Indonesia into government bonds and loans.\n\n- Reversal of Provision Expenses\n\nBBCA recorded a reversal of provision expenses of 341 billion rupiah in October 2024 (vs. September 2024: provision expense of 541 billion rupiah). This caused the credit cost during 10M24 to improve to the 0.22% level, better than management's consolidated FY24 guidance in the range of 0.3-0.4%.\n\n- Dividend Income from Subsidiaries\n\nThe increase in BBCA's net profit was also driven by dividend income from subsidiaries amounting to 1.1 trillion rupiah in October 2024, bringing the total dividends received during 10M24 to 2.3 trillion rupiah. Although dividends from subsidiaries are included in Non-Interest Income in the bank-only financial statements, it should be noted that this income will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess the bank-only performance of BBCA in October 2024 as positive, especially from the company's success in maintaining loan growth with a good NIM. Although loans are growing in line with management guidance, BBCA's liquidity is still considered ample compared to other big banks, so BBCA has room to maintain the cost of funds and grow loans. We also see a positive trend in BBCA's performance in maintaining credit costs, which indicates that asset quality is well maintained.\n\n*This article was released earlier as Stockbit Commentary.",
