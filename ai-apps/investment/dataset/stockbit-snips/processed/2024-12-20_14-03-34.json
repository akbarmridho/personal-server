      "title": "TPMA Forms JV with KKGI, Potential Net Profit Addition ~7.6%",
      "content": "Trans Power Marine ($TPMA) together with Resources Alam Indonesia ($KKGI) announced the establishment of a joint venture (JV) named PT Trans Bahtera Pioneer (TBP). TBP will operate in the field of shipping services for coal transportation and logistics in the East Kalimantan region, which in 2023 produced 210 million tons of coal, equivalent to ~30% of national production. One of TBP's clients will be PT Insani Bara Perkasa, which is a subsidiary of KKGI with a production of 5.3 million tons in 2023. The ownership of this JV consists of 50% KKGI and 50% TPMA with an initial capital of 51.5 billion rupiah, so each issuer will contribute 25.75 billion rupiah. The reporting of this JV's contribution in the financial statements of both issuers will use the equity method. In its development plan, TBP will make an investment of 200 billion rupiah for the purchase of 6 sets of used and new tugboats and barges in the first year (2025). This cooperation is expected to expand up to 20 sets in the coming years. The investment financing will consist of a minimum of 20% internal cash and the rest through bank loans. Previously, TPMA had also expanded through several JVs. In 2021, TPMA formed a JV named PT Trans Logistik Perkasa (TLP) with T&J Industrial Holding Limited (TJI) - a business entity of Tsingshan Holding Group - and Pacific Pelayaran Indonesia. In addition, in early September 2024, TPMA also established Trans Ocean Permata (TOP), which is a joint venture with PT Samudra Investama Maju. Key Takeaway: Based on our conservative estimation and management statements, TBP has the potential to provide an additional net profit of 2.5 million US dollars when it completes its entire fleet of 20 sets, equivalent to 7.6% of our FY25 estimated net profit for TPMA at the level of 32.4 million US dollars (before accounting for the net profit contribution from TBP). With 6 vessel sets in the first year, TBP has the potential to generate a net profit of 461 thousand US dollars, equivalent to 1.4% of our FY25 estimated net profit for TPMA. Some assumptions we use are: Addition of 6 vessels gradually, consisting of 2 vessels in 1Q25 and 4 vessels in 2Q-4Q25. We estimate TBP's revenue will be lower than TOP in 2025 due to the faster expected fleet delivery for TOP because it was formed earlier. Assumption of revenue per set of 1.1 billion rupiah per month (~683 thousand US dollars per month) for tugboat & barge, equivalent to TLP which has the lowest revenue per set compared to TPM and BEST, based on our calculation. Net profit margin assumption of 30%, equivalent to TOP.",
