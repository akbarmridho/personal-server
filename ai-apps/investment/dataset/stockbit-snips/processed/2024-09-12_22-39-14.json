      "title": "ADRO Plans Spin-Off of Thermal Coal Business",
      "content": "Adaro Energy Indonesia (ADRO) plans to spin-off and sell its entire thermal coal business segment under PT Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AAI). The sale of AAI shares will be conducted through an initial public offering (IPO) mechanism to interested shareholders of the company. ADRO is also considering distributing a cash dividend to all shareholders, which can later be used to help fund interested shareholders in participating in the AAI IPO. The offering price for the AAI IPO will use the volume weighted average price (VWAP) formed after the close of trading on the listing date on the exchange, while still observing transaction fairness as regulated in POJK number 35 of 2020. Based on the assessment from a public accounting firm, the fair value of AAI ranges from 2.45-2.6 billion US dollars. This plan will be discussed in the EGM on October 18, 2024. AAI is a subsidiary of ADRO with an ownership of 99.99% and is engaged in the thermal coal business line and coal mining support facilities. Some of AAI's business lines include logistics services, land, water, investment, and electricity businesses. In 1H24, AAI had total assets of 5.4 billion US dollars, equivalent to 52.9% of ADRO's total assets. In the same period, AAI's revenue and net profit were recorded at 2.6 billion US dollars and 992.8 million US dollars, equivalent to 89.4% of ADRO's revenue and 104.8% of ADRO's net profit, respectively. AAI's net profit includes a one-off income of 322.9 million US dollars which is eliminated in ADRO's net profit. Key Takeaway After this transaction, ADRO will focus on the metallurgical coal segment under Adaro Minerals (ADMR) and the renewable energy segment under Adaro Green. The funds obtained by ADRO after the AAI spin-off can be used by the company to fund expansion - both organic and inorganic - or to distribute dividends to its shareholders. Referring to the fair price of AAI and its financial statements as of 1H24, and excluding the one-off profit of 322.9 million US dollars, AAI has the potential to be traded with a valuation of 1.8-2x P/E FY24F annualized. This valuation is far below its peers, namely ITMG and PTBA, which are traded at P/E FY24F annualized valuations of 7.04 and 7.71, respectively. This transaction also potentially benefits Saratoga Investama Sedaya (SRTG) as a holder of ~15% of ADRO shares. SRTG may receive a special dividend from the AAI spin-off plan. Furthermore, SRTG will also have the option to participate in the AAI share offering.",

Bloomberg sources mentioned that ANZ has engaged financial advisors to divest this stake, with potential buyers including banks from Japan and Malaysia. Previously, ANZ had planned to sell PNBN in 2015, but negotiations were hampered because PNBN's controlling shareholder was reluctant to grant a board seat to a new investor. Bloomberg also reported that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. had previously considered buying PNBN, but later withdrew due to valuation issues.",
