      "title": "The Fed Remains Projected to Cut Interest Rates 3 Times in 2024",
      "content": "The Fed decided to keep the policy interest rate in the range of 5.25-5.5% at the meeting on Wednesday (20 March) local time, in line with consensus expectations. In that meeting, Fed officials continued to project a total interest-rate cut of 75 basis points during 2024. This projection is unchanged from the forecast made in December 2023. Assuming each cut is 25 basis points, the Fed would cut rates three times in 2024. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed will be more cautious because U.S. inflation data at the beginning of 2024 still exceeded consensus expectations. Powell also noted that the timing of rate cuts will depend on further economic data. On Thursday (21 March), the probability analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool showed that the market expects the Fed’s first rate cut to begin in June 2024, with a probability of 67.4%, up from 65.6% on 13 March 2024. Following the Fed announcement, the three major U.S. indices rose on Wednesday (20 March): the Dow Jones +1.03%, the S&P 500 +0.88%, and the Nasdaq +1.25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) fell 0.18% to a level of 103.2. On the same day, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell about 10 basis points to a level of 4.26%. Positive sentiment also appeared in gold, which strengthened by 1.2% to a price of $2,204.02 per ounce. Key Takeaway: Positive signals about potential Fed rate cuts open room for rate cuts by Bank Indonesia. However, uncertainty remains regarding the timing and magnitude of cuts. Rate cuts could act as a positive catalyst for several sectors, including banking, property, technology, and gold. On Thursday (21 March), the Indonesian Composite Index (IHSG) rose 0.1%, with the finance sector up 0.45%, property up 1.11%, and technology up 0.91%.",
