      "content": "The latest Bloomberg consensus expects Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by another 25 basis points by the end of 2025 to 4.75%, following an unexpected 25-bp cut to 5% in August 2025. The consensus also expects Indonesia’s economy to grow +4.85% YoY in 2025, higher than the previous survey’s +4.8% YoY. For comparison, the 2025 APBN outlook projects growth of about +4.7-5% YoY. For 2026, the consensus expects growth of +4.9% YoY, lower than the previous Bloomberg survey’s +5% YoY and the 2026 APBN target of +5.4% YoY. Bloomberg reported that labor unions are demanding a minimum wage increase of +10.5% YoY in 2026, the elimination of outsourcing, and the formation of task forces to prevent layoffs, in a protest held on Thursday (28 Aug). Additionally, the President of the Labour Party and Confederation of Indonesian Workers’ Unions, Said Iqbal, told Bloomberg that unions also demand raising the monthly non-taxable income threshold from 4.5 million rupiah to 7.5 million rupiah and abolishing tax on bonuses and severance pay. Iqbal warned that if demands are not met, workers are ready to launch a national strike. The Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki) reported that Indonesia’s palm oil production reached 5.29 million tonnes in June 2025 (+16% MoM, +31% YoY), marking the highest monthly level in five years. The increase was driven by crude palm oil production (+16% MoM) and refined palm oil (+17% MoM), both also setting five-year monthly records. Previously, Bloomberg reported in July 2025 that Gapki projected Indonesia’s palm oil exports to fall about -5.1% YoY in 2025 to 28 million tonnes as domestic consumption rises due to higher biodiesel blending. Gapki chairman Eddy Martono said the association expects palm oil production to grow +3.7% YoY in 2025 to 50 million tonnes. Sarana Mitra Luas (SMIL) announced that it has completed a share buyback of approximately 16.2 million shares (0.09%) at a purchase price of 486 rupiah per share on 27 Aug 2025, totaling about 7.9 billion rupiah. Previously, SMIL had executed a buyback of 4.4 million shares (0.02%) on 25 Aug 2025. Shareholders of Bank Nationalnobu (NOBU), PT Prima Cakrawala Sentosa, purchased approximately 748 million NOBU shares at an average price of about 749 rupiah per share on 22 Aug 2025. The transaction value was about 560 billion rupiah. After this transaction, PT Prima Cakrawala Sentosa’s direct ownership in NOBU increased from 10.87% to 20.87%.",

      "title": "UNTR 1H25 Earnings Call: Revision Down Guidance Volume Overburden",
      "content": "United Tractors (UNTR) held a 2Q25 earnings call on Wednesday (27 Aug) afternoon. Important notes: Revision down of overburden volume 2025. Management revised guidance for overburden volume 2025 to 1.18 billion bcm, lower than the initial target of 1.25 billion bcm, implying a -3% YoY decline from 2024 realization. The downward revision is due to bad weather in the first half of 2025 that hampered mining contractor activities. Stripping ratio for clients during 2025 is estimated at 7.7-7.8x, implying coal production of 151-153 million tonnes, a +2-3.4% YoY increase from 2024. Outlook for Heavy Equipment and Coal segments: 1. Heavy equipment: UNTR maintains guidance for Komatsu heavy equipment sales at 4,600 units for 2025, unchanged from initial guidance. For 2026, sales are expected to be relatively stagnant, before an anticipated increase in 2027 as the replacement cycle for heavy equipment in the mining sector begins. 2. Coal: Coal sales volume for 2025 is projected at 14 million tonnes, unchanged from initial guidance. Volume for 2026 is expected to be flat or slightly higher, with a maximum projected sales volume of 15 million tonnes. For 2027, UNTR expects sales volume to rise to around 17-18 million tonnes as port infrastructure development is completed. Guidance for Mineral and Gold segments for 2025 remains unchanged. UNTR maintains guidance for gold and nickel sales for 2025 at 24,000 oz of gold and 2 million tonnes of nickel. Expansion strategy: Focus on Mineral sector. For non-coal business expansion, UNTR will focus on the mineral sector rather than new renewable energy, due to larger potential acquisition scale. UNTR targets acquisitions worth USD 500 million to 1 billion, though management did not specify a timeline. Key Takeaway: Overall, the points presented by UNTR management are broadly consistent with our view of the company as described in the article, we remain neutral on UNTR. Investors should monitor UNTR's acquisition plans, as quality and sizable acquisitions could be a positive catalyst for the share price. Currently, for mining contractors, we are more positive on DEWA and PTRO, based on their respective company-specific growth drivers.",

      "content": "Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) recorded net profit of 803 billion rupiah in 2Q25 (+25% YoY, -11% QoQ). This result makes 1H25 net profit 1.7 trillion rupiah (+14% YoY), slightly above expectations at 52% of the 2025F consensus estimate (vs. 1H24: 50% annual realization). Net profit growth in 1H25 was supported by a 24% YoY increase in interest income due to adjustments in effective interest income for non-subsidized mortgage loans. Provision expenses rose +740% YoY/+275% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, pushing credit cost to 2% in 1H25 (vs. 1H24: 0.6%). Management explained that provisioning was increased due to credit restructuring downgrades and to strengthen NPL coverage ratio to 115-120% (vs. Jun 2025: 115%, Dec 2024: 115%). Separately, BBTN President Nixon L.P. Napitupulu proposed to the DPR that the FLPP interest rate be raised from 5% to a range of 6-7%.",
