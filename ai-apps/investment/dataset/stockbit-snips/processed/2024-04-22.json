      "title": "Nickel Prices Break US$19,000/Ton, Highest in 2024",
      "content": "The three-month nickel futures on the London Metal Exchange rose 4.1 % on Friday (19 April) to US$19,326 per metric ton, marking the highest level in 2024 and the first time the price breached US$19,000 per ton since September 2023. Nickel has strengthened 8.6 % week-over-week last week, with a cumulative increase of 16.4 % year-to-date as of 22 April 2024.\n\nSeveral factors are believed to be driving the recent nickel price surge, including:\n\n- The United States and United Kingdom have imposed bans on trading nickel products originating from Russia. Under this rule, Russian nickel can no longer be traded on the LME or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Russia accounts for about 6 % of global refined nickel production.\n- Delays in the approval of mining permits (RKAB) for nickel in Indonesia, which could reduce supply. Indonesia has extended the validity of RKABs from one year to three years, causing longer processing times for permit approvals.\n- Market rumours that Chinese authorities plan to purchase up to 200 000 tonnes of nickel pig iron (NPI).\n\nThe price rally occurs while many market participants still expect nickel to remain at relatively low levels. In April 2024, ING commodities analyst Ewa Manthey predicted that nickel prices would stay under pressure in the short term due to a gloomy macro-economic outlook and continued global oversupply driven by increased Indonesian production. Bloomberg’s consensus forecast projects the average nickel price to be US$17.048 per tonne in 2024. Since the start of the year, the average price has been US$16.853 per tonne up to 22 April 2024.",

      "content": "The Indonesian rupiah weakened to the 16,000 per US$ level last week, marking the lowest exchange rate since April 2020. This depreciation has heightened expectations that Bank Indonesia may raise the BI Rate. Seven out of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict a 25-basis-point increase in the BI Rate, while the remaining respondents expect the rate to remain at 6 %. In a separate survey compiled by Reuters, economists anticipate that Bank Indonesia will keep the BI Rate at 6 % during the Governor’s Board meeting on 23-24 April 2024. Reuters’ consensus also expects the central bank to begin cutting rates from the second quarter of 2024, moving to the third quarter, as the Fed adopts a more hawkish stance.",
