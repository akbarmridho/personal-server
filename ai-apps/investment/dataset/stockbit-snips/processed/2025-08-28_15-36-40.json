      "content": "1. The latest consensus compiled by Bloomberg expects Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by another 25 bps by the end of 2025 to 4.75%, following the off-consensus 25 bps cut to 5% in August 2025. Consensus also expects the Indonesian economy to grow +4.85% YoY in 2025, higher than the consensus expectation in the previous survey at +4.8% YoY. For comparison, the 2025 APBN outlook expects Indonesian economic growth of around +4.7-5% YoY. For 2026, consensus expects Indonesian economic growth to only grow +4.9% YoY, lower than the previous Bloomberg survey at +5% YoY and the 2026 APBN target of +5.4% YoY. \n2. Bloomberg reported that labor unions are demanding a minimum wage increase of +10.5% YoY in 2026, the abolition of outsourcing, and the formation of a task force to prevent layoffs in demonstrations held on Thursday (28/8). Furthermore, the President of the Labor Party and President of the Indonesian Workers' Confederation, Said Iqbal, told Bloomberg that labor unions also demand an increase in the monthly tax-free income threshold from 4.5 million rupiah to 7.5 million rupiah, as well as the abolition of tax on bonuses and severance pay. Iqbal warned that if the demands are not met, workers are prepared to stage a national strike.\n3. The Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (Gapki) noted that Indonesian palm oil production reached 5.29 million tons in June 2025 (+16% MoM, +31% YoY), marking the highest monthly level in the last 5 years. This increase was supported by crude palm oil production (+16% MoM) and palm kernel oil (+17% MoM), which also marked a five-year monthly production record. Previously, Bloomberg reported in July 2025 that Gapki estimated Indonesian palm oil exports would decrease by about -5.1% YoY during 2025 to 28 million tons, driven by increasing domestic consumption due to higher biodiesel blending. The Chairman of Gapki, Eddy Martono, stated that they expect Indonesian palm oil production to grow +3.7% YoY during 2025 to 50 million tons.",

      "title": "UNTR 1H25 Earnings Call: Downward Revision of Overburden Volume Guidance",
      "content": "United Tractors (UNTR) held its 2Q25 earnings call on Wednesday (27/8) afternoon. Here are our key notes: Downward Revision of 2025 Overburden Volume: UNTR management revised the 2025 overburden volume guidance down to 1.18 billion bcm, lower than the initial target of 1.25 billion bcm, implying a -3% YoY decrease from 2024 realization. This downward revision is due to bad weather in the first half of 2025 which hampered mining contractor activities. The clients' stripping ratio during 2025 is expected to be in the range of 7.7-7.8x, implying coal production of 151-153 million tons or a +2-3.4% YoY increase from 2024 realization. Outlook for Heavy Equipment and Coal Segments: 1. Heavy Equipment: UNTR maintains the guidance for Komatsu brand heavy equipment sales for 2025 at 4,600 units, unchanged from the initial guidance. For 2026, sales are expected to be relatively stagnant, before being expected to increase in 2027 along with the arrival of the heavy equipment replacement cycle in the mining sector. 2. Coal: Coal sales volume during 2025 is projected at 14 million tons, unchanged from the initial guidance. Coal sales volume in 2026 is predicted to be flat or slightly increase, with a maximum projected sales volume reaching 15 million tons. For 2027, UNTR expects an increase in sales volume to around 17-18 million tons following the completion of port infrastructure development. 2025 Guidance for Mineral and Gold Segments Unchanged: UNTR maintains the guidance for gold and nickel sales for 2025 at 24 thousand oz of gold and 2 million tons of nickel, respectively. Expansion Strategy: Focusing on the Mineral Sector: For non-coal business expansion, UNTR will focus on the mineral sector rather than the new and renewable energy sector due to the larger potential business scale that can be acquired. UNTR itself targets an acquisition value of 500 million to 1 billion US dollars, although management did not specify an acquisition deadline. Key Takeaway: Overall, the points conveyed by UNTR management are relatively in line with our view on the company's prospects as previously written in the article Unboxing Mining Contractors, so we remain neutral towards UNTR. Investors need to monitor the development of UNTR's acquisition plan, as a quality and sizeable acquisition could be a positive catalyst for the company's stock price. Currently, for the mining contractor sector, we are more positive towards DEWA and PTRO, based on the growth drivers specific to each company (company specific growth drivers).",

      "content": "1. BBTN: Bank Tabungan Negara recorded a net profit of 803 billion rupiah in 2Q25 (+25% YoY, -11% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 1.7 trillion rupiah (+14% YoY), slightly above expectations as it equals 52% of the 2025F consensus estimate (vs. 1H24: 50% annual realization). The growth in net profit during 1H25 was supported by a rise in interest income (+24% YoY) due to the adjustment in the effective interest income calculation for non-subsidized housing loans (KPR). Meanwhile, provision expenses increased by +740% YoY/+275% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, causing Credit Cost to rise to 2% during 1H25 (vs. 1H24: 0.6%). BBTN management explained that provisioning was increased as part of the downgrade of restructured credit, as well as an effort to strengthen the NPL coverage ratio to 115-120% (vs. June 2025: 115%, December 2024: 115%). Separately, the President Director of BBTN, Nixon L.P. Napitupulu, proposed to the House of Representatives (DPR) that the FLPP interest rate be raised from 5% to a range of 6-7%, citing that the current FLPP rate is still low.",
