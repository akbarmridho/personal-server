      "title": "Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariffs, China Retaliates",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on April 2, 2025, announced reciprocal tariffs with a minimum rate of 10% for all imports to the US. Additionally, Trump imposed higher tariffs on 57 countries that are the source of the US trade deficit [see table]. The implementation of the minimum 10% reciprocal tariff will start on April 5, 2025, while the higher tariffs for the 57 countries will take effect on April 9, 2025. The reciprocal tariffs are an addition to existing import tariffs, if any. For example, the total import tariff for China as of April 9, 2025, will reach 54%, consisting of a 34% reciprocal tariff and a 20% existing tariff. Meanwhile, Trump excluded Mexico and Canada from these reciprocal tariffs. Trump also stated that several commodities are exempted from the imposition of reciprocal tariffs, including semiconductors, copper, medical goods, and pharmaceuticals. Two days after Trump's announcement, China announced it would retaliate by imposing an additional 34% import tariff on all products from the US, effective April 10, 2025. Furthermore, China will also restrict the export of rare earths to the US starting April 4, 2025. Responding to these plans, Trump threatened that the US would re-impose an additional 50% tariff on China if the country's government did not cancel the retaliatory tariffs against the US. On the other hand, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce affirmed it 'will fight until the end' to protect its national interests. Besides China, the European Union has released a proposal regarding 25% reciprocal tariffs on several US import products starting May 16, 2025. This proposal is a response to the tariffs imposed by the US on steel and aluminum imports from Europe since March 12, 2025. Domestically, the Indonesian government stated it would not take retaliatory measures, opting instead for diplomacy and negotiation to find the best solution. Next week, the Indonesian government will send a team - including the Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani - to negotiate the tariffs set by the US government. The US is Indonesia's second-largest export destination country (after China), with export value reaching US$26.3 billion during 2024, equivalent to ~10% of total export value and ~2% of Indonesia's GDP. Based on commodities, the 'Top 5' largest US imports from Indonesia during 2024 are: 1) Electrical machinery and equipment (such as cables and modems); 2) Clothing and accessories (knitted and not knitted); 3) Footwear; 4) Animal/vegetable oils (such as palm oil products); and 5) Rubber and rubber products (such as tires). On Tuesday (8/4), the IHSG weakened by -7.9% and the Indonesian government bond yield for the 10-year tenor increased by about +8 bps to 7.08%, while the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened by 1.9% to 16,865, marking its all-time low. In the period of April 2-7, 2025, the S&P 500 plunged by -10.7%, with Nasdaq at -11.4% and EIDO at -7.2%. Stock markets in Asia also experienced declines in the period of April 2-8, 2025, with Nikkei 225 at -7.6%, SSE at -6.1%, and HSI at -13.3%. Key Takeaway: Generally, the trade war will have a negative impact on Indonesian exports, both directly (increasing selling prices and reducing demand for tariffed products) and indirectly (global economic weakening due to the trade war reducing overall Indonesian exports). Although there is an opportunity for Indonesia to increase/capture market share from countries facing higher tariffs - thus making their exports less competitive relative to Indonesia - this still depends on the negotiations conducted between various countries (including Indonesia) and the US later on. We advise investors to avoid panic selling and stay invested if investors believe the stocks they invest in have good fundamentals. History shows that the market can recover from crises, such as in 2008 and 2020. Additionally, having a diversified portfolio across various asset classes can help minimize the impact of market volatility. Investors can consider short-term government bonds that have lower volatility - such as PBS003 and ST014-T2 - or money market mutual funds.",
