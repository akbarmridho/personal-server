      "content": "IHSG closed down -0.67%. SIDO plans a share buyback up to IDR 300 M. News compilation for today. March 17, 2025. The Chairman of the Daily Board of Gerindra Party, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, stated that President Prabowo Subianto currently has no plans to reshuffle the cabinet in the near future, including for the finance minister position currently held by Sri Mulyani. Previously, Sri Mulyani was rumored to resign from her position. Sri Mulyani herself declined to comment on this issue. The consensus of economists compiled by Reuters expects Bank Indonesia to maintain the BI Rate at 5.75% in the Board of Governors Meeting on Wednesday (19/3) to protect the rupiah exchange rate from further depreciation amid the escalation of the global trade war. BPS noted that Indonesia's trade balance surplus rose to USD 3.12 billion in February 2025 (vs. Feb 2024: surplus USD 833 million, Jan 2025: surplus USD 3.45 billion), exceeding the consensus expectation of USD 2.45 billion. This result was driven by export growth of +14.05% YoY (vs. Jan 2025: +4.68% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation (+9.1% YoY) and marking the highest growth since January 2023. Meanwhile, imports only grew by +2.3% YoY (vs. Jan 2025: -2.73% YoY, expectation: +0.6% YoY). The Ministry of ESDM set the Reference Coal Price (HBA) at USD 117.76 per ton for the second period of March 2025, a decrease of -8.2% from the first period of March 2025 at USD 128.24 per ton. HBA itself has been set as the reference price for exports per March 1, 2025, with the HBA determination revised to 2 times a month. Previously, the implementation of HBA as an export reference price was predicted to suppress demand from China, considering HBA has a relatively higher price compared to the price reference generally used in global coal trading. The Minister of Transportation, Dudy Purwagandhi, stated that the government will still impose operational restrictions on freight transport from March 24-April 8, 2025, even though truck operators are threatening massive protests. Dudy mentioned that the restriction on trucks during this period is intended so that the public can avoid congestion during the Eid homecoming. The Chairman of the Central Executive Board of the Indonesian Truck Entrepreneurs Association, Gemilang Tarigan, said that freight transport entrepreneurs agree not to operate on March 20, 2025, if the government does not revise the prohibition period.",

      "title": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) 2M25: Net Profit +8% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded net profit (bank only) of 4.2 trillion rupiah in February 2025 (+12% YoY, -10% MoM). This result caused the net profit for 2M25 to grow by +8.4% YoY to 9 trillion rupiah, better than the 2025 consolidated estimate from the consensus which predicted a growth of +7% YoY. On the positive side, BBCA recorded a decrease in credit cost (CoC) in February 2025. On the other hand, liquidity is getting tighter and Net Interest Margin (NIM) is comparatively low. CoC bank only decreased to 0.05% in February 2025 (vs. January 2025: 0.76%, February 2024: 0.57%). This recovery caused CoC throughout 2M25 to fall to the level of 0.4% (vs. 2M24: 0.43%), still higher than the 2025 consolidated guidance from management which targets 0.3%. BBCA bank only credit growth throughout 2M25 slowed down to +14% YoY (vs. 1M25: +15.1% YoY, 2M24: +15.1% YoY). This slowdown is in line with management's intention to target consolidated credit growth during 2025 in the range of +6-8% YoY. Meanwhile, Third Party Fund (DPK) growth remained stagnant at +3.9% YoY in 2M25 (vs. 1M25: +3.9% YoY, 2M24: +5.1% YoY). This dynamic caused the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) to breach the 80% level again, standing at 80.6% in 2M25 (vs. 1M25: 79.7%, 2M24: 73.5%). Although liquidity tightening (rising LDR) is an industry-wide problem, BBCA still has relatively good liquidity compared to other 'Big 4 Banks'. NIM bank only stood at 5.4% in February 2025 (vs. February 2024: 5.33%, January 2025: 5.91%), marking the lowest level since February 2024. This result caused NIM throughout 2M25 to be at 5.67% (vs. 2M24: 5.52%), slightly below the 2025 consolidated guidance from management in the range of 5.7-5.8%. The relatively low growth in interest income of 7.1 trillion rupiah (+4.8% YoY, -7.6% MoM) was the main factor for the low NIM in February 2025. For comparison, annual interest income growth was in the range of +7-8% YoY in October-December (4Q24). Nevertheless, Net Interest Income (NII) still managed to grow slightly better, reaching +6% YoY in February 2025 and 2M25, driven by low interest expenses kept in check. An increase in loan yield itself is one of BBCA management's intentions this year. Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) grew +8.6% YoY during 2M25, supported by relatively efficient operating expenses (opex) with a more moderate growth of +3.5% YoY. We assess BBCA's bank only performance in February 2025 as a mixed performance because CoC successfully decreased, but the company recorded a low NIM. Nevertheless, we assess that NIM has the potential to recover in the future driven by several factors: 1) prospect of interest rate cuts; and 2) slowdown in credit growth - in line with guidance - which can impact loan yield improvement from changes in loan mix.",
