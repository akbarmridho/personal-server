      "title": "Dividend Compilation with Yield >4%",
      "content": "Entering mid-May 2025, an increasing number of issuers have held extraordinary general shareholders' meetings (RUPST) and set dividend distributions for fiscal year 2024. Stockbit has compiled a list of issuers that will distribute dividends, with the cum-date still upcoming and a minimum yield of 4% based on the market close today, Wednesday (28/5). The details are as follows. Key Takeaway: Based on the table above, issuers generally set a dividend payout ratio (DPR) for fiscal year 2024 that is relatively stable compared to fiscal year 2023. However, we observe a tendency of increasing DPR among state-owned enterprises, such as TLKM and the state-owned banking group including BMRI (2024: 78%, 2023: 60%), BBRI (2024: 86%, 2023: 80%), BBNI (2024: 65%, 2023: 50%) and BBTN (2024: 25%, 2023: 20%) following the formation and transition of state-owned enterprises to BPI Danantara. PTBA is a state-owned issuer that is attractive to watch for its upcoming dividend, as the company will hold an RUPST on 12 June 2025.",
