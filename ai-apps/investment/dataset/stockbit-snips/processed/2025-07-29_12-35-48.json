      "title": "Dairy Sector 1H25: CMRY Exceeds Expectations, ULTJ Weak",
      "content": "Cisarua Mountain Dairy ($CMRY) and Ultrajaya Milk Industry & Trading Company ($ULTJ) - the two main issuers in the dairy sector - recorded contrasting performance during 1H25. CMRY recorded net profit of Rp 514 billion in 2Q25 (+24% YoY, +7% QoQ), resulting in a net profit for 1H25 reaching Rp 994 billion (+24% YoY) and exceeding expectations (59% of 2025F consensus estimate). Meanwhile, ULTJ recorded a net profit of Rp 239 billion in 2Q25 (-32% YoY, -34% QoQ), causing the net profit for 1H25 to decrease by -20% YoY to Rp 604 billion. Here are some key highlights from the performance releases of these two issuers: Dairy Segment Recorded Weak Performance. CMRY's revenue from the 'Dairy Product' segment grew slightly in 2Q25 to Rp 933 billion (+3% YoY, +8% QoQ), although this segment was still corrected by -4% YoY during 1H25 due to weak realization in 1Q25 (-11% YoY, -16% QoQ). Due to the weakening of this business and the strength of the 'Consumer Foods' segment, the contribution of the 'Dairy Product' segment to total revenue in 1H25 fell to 35% (vs. 1H24: 42%). Meanwhile for ULTJ, total revenue decreased in 2Q25 to Rp 1.8 trillion (-16% YoY, -21% QoQ), marking the lowest realization since 3Q21 at Rp 1.7 trillion. This result caused ULTJ's total revenue in 1H25 to fall -8% YoY to Rp 4.1 trillion. At ULTJ itself, the 'Dairy' segment is the largest contributor to the company's revenue, equivalent to 77% as of 9M24. CMRY's Consumer Foods Segment Grew Solidly Amidst the 'soft' 'Dairy Product' segment, CMRY recorded solid total revenue growth in 2Q25 (+21% YoY, +11% QoQ), supported by the 'Consumer Foods' segment revenue growing +33% YoY and +13% QoQ. During 1H25, CMRY's 'Consumer Foods' segment revenue grew +32% YoY. Contrasting Opex Efficiency Levels. Besides revenue growth, CMRY also succeeded in maintaining opex, with a relatively moderate increase during 1H25 (+6% YoY). This caused the operating profit margin to rise during 1H25 to 22.2% (vs. 1H24: 19.8%), resulting in operating profit growing +31% YoY. Meanwhile, ULTJ's operating profit margin during 1H25 decreased to 16.7% (vs. 1H24: 18.9%) due to a rise in opex (+5% YoY) amidst declining revenue. This caused ULTJ's operating profit during 1H25 to fall -19% YoY. Key Takeaway: CMRY Management expects revenue growth of around +10-15% YoY during 2025, with a gross profit margin guidance in the range of 42-44%. With the performance realization during 1H25, we assess that CMRY can meet or even exceed management targets and consensus expectations. CMRY management will hold the 1H25 performance earnings call on Wednesday (30/7) afternoon. Since the release of 2Q25 results on Monday (28/7) afternoon, CMRY's stock price has risen +5.77% to Rp 4,950 per share until Tuesday (29/7).",
