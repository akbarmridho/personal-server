      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, As Expected",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to keep the BI Rate at 5.75% on Wednesday (19/2). The deposit facility and lending facility were also maintained at 5% and 6.5% respectively. The decision aligns with consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the move aims to stabilise the rupiah exchange rate, keep inflation under control, and support economic growth. He noted there is still room for a further BI Rate cut, mainly because inflation is low and to support growth, but the timing of the next cut will depend on global dynamics. Bloomberg consensus expects the BI Rate to fall another 50 basis points to 5.25% by the end of 2025. Bank Indonesia also kept its expectation of a 25 basis point Fed rate cut in 2025, the same as last month, consistent with consensus based on the CME FedWatch Tool as of Wednesday (19/2). Perry emphasized maintaining rupiah stability through pro‑market monetary instruments such as SRBI, SVBI and SUVBI. In addition, the revision of foreign exchange rules for export proceeds of natural resources effective 1 March 2025 is expected to support rupiah stability. The central bank also raised the macro‑prudential liquidity incentive (KLM) ceiling from a maximum of 4% of DPK to a maximum of 5% of DPK. The KLM incentive for the housing sector, including low‑income housing, will be increased gradually from 23 trillion rupiah to about 80 trillion rupiah as of 1 April 2025 to support the government’s housing programme. On Wednesday (19/2), the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell 1.14%, the rupiah weakened 0.42% to 16,339 per US dollar, and the 10‑year government bond yield rose 14 basis points to 6.901%.",

On the other hand, the increase in KLM incentives could be a fresh boost for the banking sector, given the generally tight liquidity conditions.",
