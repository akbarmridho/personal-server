      "title": "Car Sales -5% YoY in March 2025",
      "content": "Gaikindo recorded that national car wholesales in March 2025 dropped to 70,909 units (-5.1% YoY, -1.9% MoM), along with the shift in Lebaran seasonality and the IIMS 2025 event slightly moving toward February 2025. This result caused national car wholesales for 3M25 to reach 205,136 units (-4.7% YoY), relatively in line with expectations as it's equivalent to 23-27% of Gaikindo's 2025 target of around 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 3M24: 25% of 2024 realization). Here are some highlights of car sales in March 2025: 1. Astra Sales Weak, Though Relatively Better Than Other Japanese Brands Combined, Astra International's two main brands - Toyota + Daihatsu - recorded a decline in sales performance (-5.7% YoY, -2.3% MoM) in March 2025, worse than the industry realization (-5.1% YoY, -1.9% MoM), causing their combined market share to fall to 50.1% in March 2025 (vs. March 2024: 50.4%, February 2025: 50.3%). The decline in ASII's wholesale sales in March 2025 was primarily due to a -21% YoY decline in Daihatsu sales, while Toyota sales grew +6.3% YoY. Cumulatively over 3M25, Toyota + Daihatsu wholesales dropped -6.9% YoY to 103,954 units, worse than the industry decline (-4.7% YoY), so their combined market share for 3M25 fell to 50.7% (vs. 3M24: 51.9%). Meanwhile, sales from other Japanese brands experienced a significant weakening in March 2025, with Honda and Suzuki falling -40.4% YoY and -33.4% YoY, respectively. Cumulatively in 3M25, sales for these two brands dropped -20.4% YoY each. 2. Chinese Brand Sales Continue to Soar BYD recorded sales of 3,205 units in March 2025 (+129% MoM), marking the highest level since BYD entered Indonesia and surpassing Hyundai's sales. With this result, BYD's market share rose significantly to 4.5% in March 2025 (vs. February 2025: 1.9%). Chery again recorded its highest monthly sales of 1,829 units (+128% YoY, +25% MoM), continuing the trend from February 2025. Only Wuling showed a different trend compared to BYD and Chery. Key Takeaway Combining February and March figures—to avoid annual comparisons being distorted by Lebaran seasonality shifts—car sales fell -1.6% YoY. Although weak, this realization is relatively in line with Gaikindo's expectation targeting 2025 car sales to be relatively stagnant compared to 2024. However, the current stagnant market condition tends to be supported by the increasing contribution of Chinese brands, which erodes the market share of Japanese brands. On today's trading, Tuesday (15/4), stock prices for $ASII dropped -1.22%, $AUTO dropped -1.95%, and $DRMA dropped -0.55%.",
