      "title": "China Plans Fiscal Stimulus Without Key Details",
      "content": "China's Finance Minister Lan Fo'an appeared to test investors' patience on Saturday (12 Oct) when he announced a plan to release a fiscal stimulus package without disclosing its size. Analysts and investors had previously expected Lan to announce a stimulus worth 2 trillion yuan (US$283 billion) in a briefing at the end of the weekend. Bloomberg reported that details of the stimulus are likely to be announced at the end of October 2024 after review by the National People's Congress.\n\nAlthough the amount was not disclosed, Lan outlined several fiscal stimulus measures that the Chinese government will roll out soon, including: \n- The central government will issue more bonds to ease debt pressure on local governments, allowing them to focus on supporting their regional economies. \n- Local governments may use funds from special bonds to purchase unsold homes and convert them into subsidised housing. \n- The Ministry of Finance said there is ample room for the central government to increase debt and fiscal deficit. \n- The largest state‑owned banks in China will receive support to replenish their capital, a step taken to ease capital pressure after the People’s Bank of China cut mortgage rates significantly and trimmed its policy rate to revive the economy.\n\nBloomberg reported that no new consumption‑stimulus incentives were mentioned, nor were any household subsidies detailed.\n\nFollowing the announcement, equity markets reacted mixed: the Shanghai Composite and the CSI300 Real Estate Index closed up +2.07% and +3.94% respectively on Monday (14 Oct), while the Hang Seng Index fell –0.75%. The yuan weakened 0.18% against the US dollar on the same day.\n\nLan’s announcement came one day before the National Bureau of Statistics of China released that the consumer price index (CPI) for September 2024 was unchanged month‑on‑month and eased to 0.4% year‑on‑year (vs. August 2024: 0.4% MoM and 0.6% YoY), below consensus expectations of 0.4% MoM and 0.6% YoY. Core CPI was unchanged month‑on‑month and fell to 0.1% YoY (vs. August 2024: 0.4% MoM and 0.3% YoY), the lowest annual reading since February 2021.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThere are two potential implications of the China stimulus development for Indonesia. From a financial‑market perspective, the attractiveness of the Chinese market to foreign investors could decline if the stimulus size falls short of consensus, potentially reversing the recent foreign outflows from several countries—including Indonesia. From an economic standpoint, successful stimulus that revives the Chinese economy could positively affect Indonesia’s exports of commodities such as coal, CPO, copper and nickel.\n\n*Correction: On Friday (11 Oct), the Stockbit Snips headline mistakenly stated that the construction of 3 million houses per year under the Prabowo administration could raise cement consumption by 60 million tonnes per year (94% of 2023 domestic consumption). The correct estimate is an increase of 6 million tonnes, or 9.4% of 2023 domestic consumption. The error has been corrected on the website.",
