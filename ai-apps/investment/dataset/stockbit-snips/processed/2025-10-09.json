      "title": "Government Optimistic Loan Growth Accelerates to +10% YoY Following Liquidity Injection Realization",
      "content": "Director General of the Ministry of Finance, Febrio Kacaribu, announced on Thursday (9/10) the realization of credit disbursement from a liquidity injection totaling 200 trillion rupiah placed by the government into the state-owned banks (Himbara) in September 2025. According to Ministry of Finance data, about 113 trillion rupiah or roughly 56% of the total funds have been disbursed. This makes the Ministry optimistic that industry-wide credit growth can reach +10% year-on-year by the end of 2025 (versus 8M25: +7.56% YoY), in line with the 2025 target that has been downgraded by Bank Indonesia to a range of +8-11% YoY. In general, Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded the highest disbursement rate of 74%, while Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) had the lowest disbursement rate of 19%. Both BMRI and Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS) aim to have all liquidity-injection funds disbursed before the end of 2025, while Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) targets the remaining funds to be disbursed no later than the end of October 2025. Febrio said that the majority of the liquidity-injection funds placed by Himbara are directed to the housing, construction, and agriculture sectors. Meanwhile, BBRI stated that it also channels funding to the plantation, trade, and industry sectors. BRIS announced that it will prioritize fund allocation to government programs such as the Red-White Village Cooperatives and Free Nutritious Meals, as well as financing for MSMEs and housing for non-civil servants. The interest that Himbara must pay on the government's own deposits will decrease from about 3.8% to 2% if the funds are channeled to the Red-White Village Cooperative program. Director of BBRI, Hery Gunardi, hopes the Ministry of Finance will increase fund placement at BBRI so the company can accelerate financing to productive sectors, given that credit disbursement to these sectors is relatively easy due to high demand. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa claimed that BMRI may also request additional fund placement to finance the property and automotive sectors. Recently, the government also plans to inject funds into regional development banks, with Purbaya stating that it will place funds into Bank Jakarta and East Java Regional Development Bank (BJTM) each around 5-10 trillion rupiah. Separately, Purbaya asked Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) to accelerate credit growth over the next two months, while warning that the government will withdraw fund placement from the bank if growth is deemed weak. Purbaya claimed that BBNI management targets credit growth above +11% YoY in 2026, higher than the 2025 guidance of +8-10% YoY.",

He also reaffirmed plans to launch mandatory E10 gasoline, with ethanol sourced from sugarcane or cassava. The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) now forecasts a refined copper deficit of 150,000 tonnes in 2026, revising down from a previously expected surplus. The revision reflects tighter supply due to force majeure at Freeport Indonesia’s Grasberg mine and disruptions in Chile and Congo, and a slowdown in copper production growth to +1.4% YoY in 2025 and +0.9% YoY in 2026. Bank Indonesia projects retail sales in September 2025 to grow +5.8% YoY, though month-on-month it is expected to contract -0.3%. In August 2025, retail sales rose +3.5% YoY and +0.6% MoM, outperforming BI’s forecast of +2.7% YoY and -0.3% MoM. The Indonesian Motorbike Industry Association (AISI) reported domestic motorcycle sales of 567,173 units in September 2025 (+7.3% YoY, -1.9% MoM), bringing 9M25 total to about 4.8 million units, roughly -0.7% YoY and 72-76% of the 2025 target. Bloomberg reported that Indonesia will halt imports of scrap metal until further notice to prevent further radioactive Caesium-137 contamination after a task force found traces in 22 factories in the Cikande Modern Industrial Area. The task force will initiate decontamination procedures with the National Nuclear Energy Agency.
