      "title": "BBCA FY24: Net Profit +12.7% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded a net profit of IDR 13.8 trillion in 4Q24 (-3% QoQ, +13% YoY). This result caused the net profit for FY24 to grow to IDR 54.8 trillion (+12.7% YoY), in line with expectations as it equates to 100% of the consensus FY24F estimate. BBCA's positive performance was supported by: 1) Net Interest Margin (NIM) being at the upper end of guidance; 2) Credit Cost (CoC) in line with guidance along with maintained asset quality; and 3) credit growth exceeding guidance. NIM was at the Upper End of Guidance; FY25 NIM Target at 5.7-5.8%. Bank-only NIM in 4Q24 increased to 6%, resulting in an FY24 NIM of 5.8%, situated in the upper range of management's FY24 guidance which had been upgraded to around 5.7-5.8%. BBCA management targets the FY25 NIM to be stable in the range of 5.7-5.8%, the same as the FY24 guidance. CoC In Line with Guidance Along With Maintained Asset Quality; FY25 CoC Target at 0.3%. Bank-only CoC in 4Q24 was recorded at -0.1%, resulting in an FY24 CoC of 0.3%, in line with management's FY24 guidance, which targeted the range of 0.3-0.4%. This result was supported by maintained asset quality, with gross NPL bank-only improving to 1.8% and loan-at-risk (LAR) bank-only falling to 5.3%. BBCA management targets FY25 CoC to remain stable at 0.3%. Credit Growth Exceeded Guidance; Credit Growth to Slow Down in FY25. Credit growth in FY24 stabilized at +13.8% YoY (vs. FY23: +13.9% YoY), exceeding management's FY24 guidance which had been upgraded to the range of +10-12%. Credit growth was driven by the corporate segment at +15.7% YoY, mainly from investment loans. BBCA management targets credit growth to slow down to +6-8% in FY25. Key Takeaway: We assess BBCA's performance in FY24 as positive, with the company's NIM successfully reaching the upper end of guidance and asset quality continuing to improve. The signal of slowing credit growth in FY25 is in line with expectations of weak public purchasing power.",

Besides China, Trump also mentioned imposing import tariffs on the European Union because the region treats the US very poorly, although he did not elaborate further.",
