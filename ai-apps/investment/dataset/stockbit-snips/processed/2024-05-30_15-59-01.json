      "title": "Global Shift To Renewables Slowed In 2023, Policy Group Says",
      "content": "The policy group REN21 reported that the global shift to renewable energy slowed in 2023 due to regulatory gaps, political pressures, and failure to set clear targets. By the end of 2023, only 13 countries, including the US, India, and China, had implemented renewable energy policies across the building, industry, transportation, and agriculture sectors, but their contribution was only 12.7% of total energy consumed. REN21 also reported that among 69 countries with end-user renewable energy targets, only 17 extended those targets beyond 2024.",

      "title": "BYD Releases New Hybrid Car, Risk for ASII",
      "content": "BYD announced the launch of a new plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) with the latest technology (DM 5.0), claimed to have fuel consumption as efficient as 2.9 liters per 100 km or 34.5 km per liter (vs. DM 4.0: 3.8 liters per 100 km or 26.3 km per liter). The price for the DM 5.0 version will start from 99.8 thousand yuan (equivalent to ~220 million rupiah) compared to the DM 4.0 which has a starting price of 79.8 thousand yuan (equivalent to ~180 million rupiah). However, the car price has the potential to be higher if it enters Indonesia due to applicable taxes, such as import tax and luxury goods sales tax (PPnBM). To date, there is still no further information on whether the PHEV DM 5.0 (models: Qin L sedan and Seal 06 sedan) will be marketed by BYD in Indonesia, considering that the DM 4.0 version (models: Qin Plus DM-i sedan and Song Plus DM-i SUV) has also not yet entered Indonesia. However, with BYD officially entering Indonesia early this year and the purchase of their land in Subang, it is not impossible that its PHEV cars will be marketed in Indonesia in the future, starting with DM 4.0. Looking at the IIMS 2024 event, BYD products were responded to positively with vehicle purchase orders (SPK) reaching 1,000 units (vs. Toyota SPK: 762 units and Wuling SPK: 799 units). As of now, BYD has only marketed 3 battery electric vehicle (BEV) models in Indonesia, namely the Dolphin SUV, Atto 3 SUV, and Seal sedan. These products have starting prices of 425 million rupiah, 515 million rupiah, and 629 million rupiah, respectively. The hybrid car segment itself has experienced rapid growth in Indonesia, where ASII is the market leader in the hybrid segment with a market share up to 72.5% as of FY23. Key Takeaway: With a much more affordable selling price, the potential presence of hybrid cars from BYD can have a negative impact on ASII's market share. For information, hybrid cars distributed by ASII - such as the Innova Zenix Hybrid (fuel consumption 18.8 km per liter) and Yaris Cross Hybrid (fuel consumption 27 km per liter) - each have a more expensive price than BYD, starting at 430 million rupiah and 367 million rupiah, respectively. In terms of contribution, hybrid cars accounted for ~7% of ASII's total car sales volume in FY23.",
