      "title": "VAT 12% Only Applies to Luxury Goods",
      "content": "The Chairman of Commission XI of the DPR, Mukhamad Misbakhun, on Thursday (5/12) stated that the government will still raise the value-added tax (VAT) from 11% to 12% starting January 2025, although he claimed that the increase will only apply to luxury goods. Until now, the government has not released a list of luxury goods that will incur this VAT increase. According to the Deputy Chairman of the DPR, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, the list of luxury goods subject to 12% VAT will be compiled by the Ministry of Finance. Misbakhun mentioned that staple goods, education services, health services, banking services, and public services will remain exempt from VAT, in line with existing policy. This government announcement comes amid pressure from business groups and labor unions who are requesting a postponement of the VAT increase, considering the weakening purchasing power of the community. According to a Kompas report, the burden carried by the public in 2025 will increase along with the restriction of fuel subsidies, and the implementation of various levies such as the increase in BPJS Kesehatan premium contribution rates, additional mandatory pension fund contributions, and mandatory third-party liability motor vehicle insurance contributions. In a separate occasion, the Minister of SMEs, Maman Abdurrahman, stated on Thursday (5/12) that the government is studying the extension of the 0.5% final income tax (PPh) utilization period for MSMEs. Maman also denied news that the 0.5% final PPh for MSMEs would end in December 2024. Maman affirmed that the applicable provisions remain the same, namely 7 years for individual taxpayers and 4 years for corporate taxpayers.",

      "content": "The selective VAT increase on luxury goods is the government's compromise to increase state revenue while maintaining public purchasing power, especially for the lower-middle class. This generally provides relief to sectors/issuers targeting the lower-middle segment, while potentially having a negative impact on issuers targeting the upper-middle segment. However, the definition and list of 'luxury goods' released by the government need further monitoring to conclude the potential impact on specific sectors/issuers.",

      "content": "OPEC+ on Thursday (5/12) officially postponed the recovery of oil production for 3 months until April 2025 and extended the oil production recovery period from 12 months to 18 months. Consequently, the 2.2 million barrels per day of oil production from OPEC+ will only fully recover in September 2026, with the recovery speed slowing down monthly from 180,000 barrels per day to 120,000 barrels per day. This decision marks the third postponement of oil production recovery by OPEC+ amid weak demand and a surge in production outside the group. Before being postponed multiple times, OPEC+ initially planned to gradually recover 2.2 million barrels per day of oil production starting from October 2024. Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, claimed that Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) will build a factory in Indonesia, although he did not elaborate. Agus mentioned that his ministry has coordinated with the Ministry of Investment to follow up on Apple's investment plan. Previously, the Minister of Investment, Rosan Roeslani, stated this week that Apple had raised its investment proposal to 1 billion US dollars, a 100-fold increase from the initial plan of 10 million US dollars. This investment is aimed at enabling the iPhone 16 series to obtain a 40% domestic component level certificate (TKDN), so it can be officially sold in Indonesia. Bank Indonesia recorded that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of November 2024 slightly decreased to 150.2 billion US dollars (vs. October 2024: 151.2 billion US dollars). The position of foreign exchange reserves is equivalent to financing 6.5 months of imports or 6.3 months of imports and government foreign debt payments, which is above the international adequacy standard of around 3 months of imports. Bank Indonesia assesses that these foreign exchange reserves are capable of supporting external sector resilience and maintaining macroeconomy and financial system stability. The Chairman of the Indonesian General Insurance Association, Budi Herawan, stated that the government will implement third-party liability (TPL) insurance in 2H25, according to the initial plan. Nevertheless, Budi could not confirm whether TPL insurance can truly be implemented in 2025, considering it could burden the public. Budi also mentioned that the draft regulation for TPL insurance is already with the Ministry of Finance, although he did not elaborate further on the contents of the regulation. Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, stated that the government is preparing a 5-year roadmap policy for lowering air ticket prices, aimed at making air ticket prices more affordable for the public. Previously, the government had lowered domestic air ticket prices by 10% during the Christmas and New Year (Nataru) period from December 19, 2024, to January 3, 2025. The Head of Traffic Corps of the Indonesian National Police, Inspector General Pol. Aan Suhanan, said that the total community movement during the Christmas 2024 and New Year 2025 (Nataru) moments is projected to increase by +2.8% YoY to 110.67 million people, based on a survey from the Ministry of Transportation.",
