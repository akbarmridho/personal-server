      "title": "Kemendag Usul Bea Masuk hingga 200% untuk Keramik China",
      "content": "The Anti-Dumping Committee of Indonesia (KADI) from the Ministry of Trade (Kemendag) on July 2, 2024, recommended an Anti-Dumping Import Duty (BMAD) rate of approximately 100.12-199.88% for ceramic imports originating from China. This recommendation was given after KADI concluded that there was a causality between the loss suffered by the domestic ceramic industry and the dumped goods from China. Currently, imported ceramics are subject to Safeguard Import Duty (BMTP) of 13% through Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) No.156/PMK.010/2021, valid until November 2024. Despite this, the price of ceramics made by the domestic industry still cannot compete with the price of imported ceramics from China. Based on KADI's report, ceramic imports from China contributed to 41% of national consumption during the July 2021-June 2022 period, while 49% came from domestic sources and the remaining 10% from imports from other countries. Responding to this recommendation, the Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramics Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, told Investor Daily that the results of KADI's investigation reflect fairness and government support for the sustainability of the national ceramic industry. Edy explained that the domestic ceramic industry has been severely hit by imported products, reflected in the factory utilization rate which dropped from 75% in 2022 to 63% in 1H24. Until now, it is still unknown when the Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) related to BMAD will be implemented. Today, Friday (5/7), the Minister of Trade, Zulkifli Hasan, said that the government will still investigate a wider range of goods from various countries besides China that will subsequently be subject to BMAD. Besides ceramics, Zulkifli also said that his team will monitor textile, apparel, footwear, cosmetic, and electronic imports. On another note, Edy mentioned that he is confident that the grace period between the KADI report and the implementation of BMAD will be utilized by importers to conduct massive imports to avoid import duties. Key Takeaway: We assess that the implementation of the BMAD policy will have a positive impact on domestic ceramic producers such as Arwana Citramulia ($ARNA) and Cahayaputra Asa Keramik ($CAKK), considering that the price of Chinese imported ceramics will rise in line with the BMAD tariff. Consequently, local ceramic prices will become more competitive compared to Chinese ceramic products, potentially increasing demand volume, factory utilization, and company profitability. On the other hand, the potential exploitation of the grace period by importers could increase the stock of Chinese imported ceramics domestically. If this occurs, it could create a lagging effect between the implementation of BMAD and the increase in domestic ceramic industry sales volume.",
