However, an acceleration in economic growth is needed before investors can see acceleration in quality credit growth - both in terms of margin and asset quality - and a reduction in the level of provision booking. From a valuation aspect, BBRI as of Tuesday (30/9) is trading at ~1.8x 1-Year Forward P/BV, about -1.5 Standard Deviation below the 5-year historical average.",

      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, told the Financial Times that the government is planning a stimulus package worth 2 billion US dollars to boost consumer spending during the Christmas and New Year holiday period. In this stimulus package, Airlangga mentioned that the government will provide discounts for transportation, groceries, retail purchases, and tax exemptions for airline tickets. Prior to this stimulus, the Financial Times reported that the government had announced a total stimulus package worth 4.5 billion US dollars since December 2024.\nChairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki), Eddy Martono, stated that they estimate Indonesian palm oil exports will increase from the level of 29.5 million tons in 2024 to 30 million tons in 2025, driven by increased purchases from India. This estimate is higher than Gapki's previous projection in July 2025, which at that time projected Indonesian palm oil exports for 2025 would only reach 28 million tons due to the B40 biodiesel blending mandate. For 2026, Eddy mentioned that Indonesian palm oil exports will tend to stagnate year-on-year. Meanwhile, Indonesia's total palm oil production in 2026 is estimated to reach 56 million tons, up from the estimated production for 2025 at 55 million tons.\nThe Constitutional Court on Monday (29/9) annulled the requirement in the law regarding people's housing savings (Tapera) that obligates workers and employers to deposit a portion of their salary into the Tapera program. The Constitutional Court granted the request to make Tapera contributions optional, not mandatory. The Constitutional Court gave the DPR 2 years to revise the law.\nMinister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, temporarily postponed the imposition of taxes for e-commerce traders with annual turnover between 500 million and 4.8 billion rupiah until the economic conditions stabilize. The Director of Economics at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, Nailul Huda, told Kontan that the additional tax revenue from this policy only ranges from 500 billion to 1.5 trillion rupiah.",
