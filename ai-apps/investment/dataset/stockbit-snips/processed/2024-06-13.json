      "title": "The Fed Lowers Expectations for Rate Cuts",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (12 June) reported that inflation eased in May 2024 and fell below expectations. Details: • Inflation month-over-month (MoM): 0.0% (consensus: 0.1%; April 2024: 0.3%). • Inflation year-over-year (YoY): 3.3% (consensus: 3.4%; April 2024: 3.4%). • Core inflation MoM: 0.2% (consensus: 0.3%; April 2024: 0.3%). • Core inflation YoY: 3.4% (consensus: 3.5%; April 2024: 3.6%).\n\nA few hours after the inflation release, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the policy rate at 5.25-5.50% as market consensus expected. The Fed also released its latest dot-plot, showing that rate cuts in 2024 are projected to total only 25 basis points (one cut), down from the previous projection of 75 basis points (three cuts). The Fed said that to date only modest progress has been made toward achieving the 2% inflation target.\n\nThe above developments lifted market expectations for a rate cut in September 2024. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed starting to cut rates in September 2024 rose to 62.4% from 52.8% before the inflation release and the Fed meeting.\n\nFollowing the inflation release and the Fed meeting, U.S. market data on Wednesday (12 June) showed: – U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell –0.59%. – U.S. equity indices rose: S&P +0.85%, Nasdaq +1.53%, DJIA –0.09%. – 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 10 basis points.\n\nIn Indonesia on Thursday (13 June): – The rupiah closed stronger by +0.06% at 16,286 per USD. – The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell –0.27% to 6,831. – The 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose +6 basis points to 7.08%.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "The weak reaction in the rupiah, Indonesian government bond yields, and the Jakarta Composite Index on the day’s trading indicate that foreign investor interest has not yet returned to Indonesia. For Indonesia itself, we assess that Bank Indonesia can only start cutting rates if the rupiah strengthens convincingly. Consensus expects the central bank to begin easing in 4Q24.\n\nTo mitigate volatility risk from uncertain rate direction, investors can lock in high-yield government bonds – especially short-term series such as FR0081 and PBS032 – at attractive levels. Meanwhile, SBR013 can be used to hedge high-rate risk because it carries a floating-rate coupon with a floor. In the equity market, with valuations now cheap, the momentum can be used to accumulate quality stocks such as the Big 4 banks, $TLKM, and $ASII.",
