Both have the potential to negatively impact the demand for mining services. Nickel mining is becoming a new growth engine, but the difference in scale compared to coal makes it difficult to compensate for the potential overall decline in business. Given this context, we assess that investors can focus on issuers whose growth prospects come from the company level (company-specific drivers) such as Darma Henwa ($DEWA) and Petrosea ($PTRO). Meanwhile, we see the outlook for United Tractors ($UNTR) as difficult to escape the general dynamics of its sector, given its large scale.",

We expect the decline in coal production to continue in 2026, in response to still relatively weak demand from China and India. Meanwhile, soft coal prices have the potential to compress the stripping ratio. On the other hand, despite having a brighter growth prospect and higher mining fees, the total overburden volume from nickel is only equivalent to ~10% of the total coal overburden volume due to differences in production scale (~700 million tons vs. ~300 million tons annually) and stripping ratio levels (5-10x vs. 1-3x).",

Meanwhile, the performance of mining producers tends to fluctuate depending on commodity price movements.

Challenges in the core business - We see UNTR's heavy equipment business segment - which contributes ~19% of the company's earnings before tax in the last 5 years - potentially facing sales volume pressure due to increasing competition from Chinese products and the prospect of declining national coal production. We also assess that declining coal production and soft coal prices will burden UNTR's mining contracting segment, which contributes ~48% of earnings before tax in the last 5 years. Although UNTR's mining contracting segment is beginning to enter the nickel sector, its contribution will still be relatively small. On the bottom line, we estimate earnings before tax from UNTR's heavy equipment and mining contractor businesses will decrease annually by -8.3/-6.8% and -16.5/-10.8% in 2025F/2026F respectively, following volume and margin declines. Non-core businesses do not yet have catalysts in the near term - We assess that UNTR's non-core businesses related to metals and minerals cannot yet compensate for the pressure faced by the core business. This is because UNTR is undergoing a development process, both in its gold and nickel businesses, the results of which will not be felt in the next 1-2 years. Overall, we estimate the contribution of the metals and mineral business will only account for 12/16% of total earnings before tax in 2025F/2026F. Valuation and dividends are quite attractive - In terms of valuation, UNTR is currently trading at 5.1x 1-Year Forward P/E, slightly below -1x Standard Deviation below the 5-year historical average, and 0.88x P/BV. From a dividend perspective, we project UNTR will distribute dividends of Rp7 T/Rp6.7 T from the 2025F/2026F fiscal years, assuming a payout ratio of 40%. This dividend size indicates a dividend yield for the 2025F/2026F fiscal years of 8.3%/8% as of Tuesday (22/7). We assess that the valuation level and dividend potential of UNTR are quite attractive. However, considering the performance outlook for the next 2 years and the absence of positive catalysts in the near term, we are overall neutral towards UNTR. We consider UNTR's success in significantly growing its metals and minerals business - including optimizing balance sheet capacity to accelerate business transition - as a positive catalyst for the company.",

Besides revenue decline, we project both segments will potentially experience margin decline due to tight competition in the heavy equipment sales industry and a decline in overburden volume negatively impacting operating leverage. Meanwhile, the metals and minerals segment, which is the focus of UNTR's diversification going forward, will still have a minimal contribution (11.5%/15.7% of total earnings before tax in 2025F/2026F) and will not see a significant surge in the next 2 years.",

We also lowered the projected earnings before tax margin for UNTR's heavy equipment segment by -30 bps/-50 bps to 8.9% and 8.4% in 2025/2026F, in line with the decline in average selling price (ASP) and sales volume. The projection of declining national coal production has the potential to reduce heavy equipment demand. Furthermore, increasing competition in the heavy equipment business is seen from the trend of Komatsu's market share declining from a stable range of 28-30% in recent years (except 2021) to 26% during 5M25. Although Komatsu's market share in 5M25 appears stable compared to the 2024 realization of 26%, UNTR management explained that the realization of heavy equipment sales in 5M25 was influenced by the delivery backlog from last year that was only delivered early this year. Therefore, we estimate Komatsu's market share by the end of 2025 could be lower than 26%. The selection of the XCMG brand by DEWA also illustrates increasing competition in the heavy equipment business. We assume a decline in Komatsu heavy equipment sales volume to 4,500 units in 2026F, after rising to 4,600 units in 2025F. We also assume an annual ASP decline of -4%/-2.8% in 2025F/2026F, negatively impacting margins.",

We project segment revenue to decrease annually by -0.3%/-5% in 2025F/2026F, while earnings before tax decrease by -16.5%/-10.8%. We assess that declining national production expectations and compressed stripping ratios—due to soft coal prices—have the potential to negatively impact overburden volume and operating leverage. On the other hand, PAMA's expansion into the nickel sector is not expected to provide a significant contribution in the near term. This is considering the relatively smaller scale of nickel production in Indonesia compared to coal. Furthermore, nickel mines' characteristics, which generally have low stripping ratios, also limit the potential volume of work that can be handled. We estimate that overburden volume and client coal production will decrease annually by -5%/-5% in 2026F, after growing by +2.7%/+1.4% to 1.25 billion bcm/150 million tons in 2025F. We also expect a decline in the earnings before tax margin in UNTR's mining contractor segment by -340 bps/-110 bps to 17.4%/16.3% in 2025F/2026F.",

In addition, UNTR is also focusing on the phase-2 exploration at the Martabe gold mine, which can become the company's growth engine going forward. UNTR explained that the increase in dry tailing capacity and the phase-2 exploration of the Martabe mine will only be completed in 2027. In the nickel segment, UNTR stated that the company will not increase nickel ore production volume, as the RKEF smelter is still in the construction phase and the HPAL smelter is still in the feasibility study phase. UNTR will consider increasing nickel ore production again after completing the construction of the RKEF smelter. We estimate UNTR's gold sales volume will be at the level of 240 thousand oz (+3.4%/+0% YoY) in 2025F/2026F, while nickel sales volume will be at the level of 2 million WMT (+1.3%/+0% YoY).",

      "content": "Full discussion regarding DEWA below was previously published by us in Unboxing DEWA on June 9, 2025. Multi-year growth story - We assess DEWA offers significant growth potential in the coming years, with company EBITDA projected to grow from Rp896 M in 2024 to Rp3.7 T in 2028 (CAGR +43%). Meanwhile, we estimate DEWA's net profit will reach Rp1.6 T in 2028 (CAGR +216%), up from Rp16 M in 2024. This growth will be driven by: 1) margin improvement accompanying business model transformation, from previously relying on subcontractors to being executed internally; and 2) potential for new contracts from affiliated groups. Business model transformation - DEWA is undergoing a business model transformation, which will reduce dependence on subcontractors and shift work on existing contracts entirely internally. The portion of internal work we expect will rise gradually from 52% in 2024 to 100% in 2028F. This transformation will boost the company's EBITDA margin from 15% in 2024 to 35% in 2028F, considering the significant margin difference if projects are executed via subcontractors (~8%) compared to internally (~35%). Besides upside from existing contracts, DEWA management also indicated the potential for new contract additions from affiliated parties, if the company proves capable of performing well. We assume new contract additions from affiliates reaching 50 million bcm in 2026F, followed by an addition of 25 million bcm each in 2027F and 2028F. Capacity and capability improvement as capital for transformation - The ample balance sheet post-financial restructuring in the form of a debt-to-equity swap undertaken by DEWA in early 2025 opens funding access from banking and non-banking sources (including vendor financing) which can be used to bring in heavy equipment for the company's projects. In addition, the joining of Teguh Boentoro (Salim's affiliate) in DEWA's board of directors shows the company's seriousness to execute the above transformation strategy.",

At a price of Rp204/share as of July 22, 2025, DEWA is trading at a valuation of 15.8x P/E 2025F and 7.9x P/E 2026F, more premium compared to United Tractors' ($UNTR) current valuation at 4.8x P/E 2025F. Considering the potential performance in the next 2-3 years, we see DEWA can trade at Rp270/share (+32% upside) or equivalent to 6.7x P/E 2028F. Although still higher than UNTR's P/E 2025F, we feel DEWA deserves to trade at a premium valuation because the company focuses on the mining contractor segment, which is UNTR's best segment. Furthermore, considering the 2-3 year growth prospect coming from internal initiatives and execution, we see the business risk from these growth sources as relatively small. The success of this business transformation is also already visible from DEWA's EBITDA and net profit growing +62% QoQ and +901% QoQ in 1Q25. Risks - Some main risks for DEWA we see are: 1) the progress of the transition from subcontractor to in-house being obstructed/slower than expected and/or new contract acquisition being lower than expected; 2) a significant decline in coal prices which can impact mining fee reduction; and 3) potential asset impairment along with a low reinvestment rate in recent years.",

After management changes in June 2023 and 2024, and financial restructuring earlier in 2025, we see potential for DEWA's performance growth in the coming years (multi-year growth). This growth will be driven by 2 factors, namely: 1) accompanying business model transformation, from previously relying on subcontractors to being executed internally; and 2) potential for new contract additions from affiliated groups. We project DEWA's net profit will grow from Rp16 M in 2024 to Rp1.6 T in 2028F, reflecting a 4-year CAGR growth of +216%. We also estimate the company's EBITDA will reach Rp3.7 T in 2028F, growing from Rp896 M in 2024 and reflecting a 4-year CAGR of +43%. This growth prospect can be achieved through capacity and capability enhancement. In terms of capital, the ample balance sheet after performing a debt to equity swap allows DEWA to obtain funding - both from banking and vendor financing - to ensure the availability of heavy equipment to execute every project. In addition, the joining of Teguh Boentoro (Salim affiliate) in DEWA's board of directors indicates the company's seriousness to execute the above transformation strategy.",

      "content": "DEWA is undergoing a business model transformation, from previously relying on subcontractors to execute projects to fully internal execution. This transformation has the potential to boost DEWA's margin going forward. Based on our analysis of the company's performance in 1Q25, DEWA posted an EBITDA margin of ~35% for internally performed projects, an increase of more than 4x compared to the margin when using subcontractors in the range of ~8%. We consider an EBITDA margin of 35% to be an achievable figure, as it is equivalent to PAMA's EBITDA margin of 34% throughout 2024. PAMA is the sector leader in mining contracting services. To smooth this business transformation initiative, DEWA management at the end of 2024 decided to increase internal production capacity by 30 million bcm per year through a syndicated credit facility worth Rp2.6 T led by Bank Central Asia ($BBCA). Some of the equipment purchased using this facility - equivalent to the capacity for ~5.7 million bcm of work per year - was received by the company at the end of 2024, while the remainder is expected to arrive in early 2025. In 2025, DEWA will again increase its heavy equipment capacity equivalent to 30 million bcm per year, where the equipment is financed by vendors (vendor financing) and is expected to be received by the company in early 3Q25. Through this vendor financing scheme, DEWA's heavy equipment supplier, XCMG China, provides deferred payment terms, so DEWA does not need to make a full payment for its heavy equipment purchases and can pay in installments over the agreed tenor. Based on DEWA management projections, when this business model transformation is fully underway in 2027F, this initiative has the potential to increase DEWA's internal production capacity for AI and KPC from ~100 million bcm at the end of 2024 (48% of total operating capacity) to 147.6 million bcm at the end of 2027 (100% of total operating capacity).",

This contract is expected to reach 50 million bcm per year and can be increased up to 150 million bcm per year, if DEWA successfully records good performance. We see DEWA's expansion and contract growth pathway running smoothly, considering its affiliation with a large Indonesian conglomerate and in line with the trend of awarding contracts to affiliated entities to enhance economic value within the group's ecosystem. In addition to the potential for new contracts up to 150 million bcm per year, we expect that DEWA can still obtain other contracts given the still large balance sheet capacity and the many new projects from related groups. Based on our analysis, several affiliated entities that have the potential to add work for DEWA are: 1. BRMS, a gold and copper company affiliated with the BUMI group. As of 2024, BRMS had total reserves of 5,054 koz of gold and 613 thousand tons of copper. 2. Ithaca Resources, a coal mining group affiliated with the CEO of BRMS and Deputy CEO of BUMI, Agoes Projosasmito. 3. Gayo Mineral Resources, a DEWA subsidiary engaged in gold mining. Based on DEWA management statements, Gayo Mineral Resources is expected to complete JORC in 2027. After completing JORC, DEWA has the potential to gain additional profit from the revaluation results of Gayo Mineral Resources. In addition, the operation of Gayo Mineral Resources has the potential to become additional work for DEWA. 4. Mach Metal Australia, a gold and copper mine owned by the Salim group in Australia.",

Our calculation considers the company's sustained growth until 2028 (multi-year growth) followed by stable performance thereafter. At a price of Rp270/share, DEWA has P/E valuations for 2025F, 2026F, and 2027F of 20.9x, 10.4x, and 7.6x, respectively. The price of Rp270/share also implies EV/EBITDA for 2025F, 2026F, and 2027F of 7.6x, 4.9x, and 4x, respectively. The calculation of DEWA's fair value depends on 2 main factors: 1) the speed of the transition progress from subcontractors to in-house for existing contracts (KPC and AI); and 2) the addition of new work contracts outside existing contracts. In our base-case scenario, which results in a fair value of Rp270/share, we estimate that the total portion of internal work will increase to 69% in 2025F, 87% in 2026F, and 98% in 2027F. This scenario also assumes additional work of 50 million bcm in 2026F, increasing to 75 million bcm in 2027F and 100 million bcm in 2028F. Outside the base-case scenario, we also calculated the fair value of DEWA based on a more optimistic (bull-case) and more pessimistic (bear-case) scenario. The bull-case scenario yields a fair value of Rp300/share (+47% upside), while the bear-case scenario results in a fair value at Rp160/share (-21% downside).",

      "content": "Besides calculating the fair value using conventional valuation methods, we believe that investors also need to observe the owner or controller aspect, which has the potential to influence how the market values DEWA. Using BRMS as a case study, we see DEWA has the potential to trade at a premium relative to its short-term performance outlook (next 12 months). In other words, DEWA's valuation has the potential to reflect its performance outlook in the next 2-3 years. We use BRMS as a case study to see the potential premium valuation of DEWA by considering the similarities between the two companies: 1) Controller, where both companies are sister companies under the BUMI group; 2) Corporate action presence; and 3) Significant growth prospects post-corporate action. In 2021, BRMS conducted 2 rights issues with total funds raised of ~Rp3.3 T to finance the expansion of gold mines in Palu (PT Citra Palu Minerals or CPM) and gold and copper mines in Gorontalo (PT Gorontalo Minerals or GM). Although the contribution from this BRMS expansion only started to be significantly reflected in the financial performance in 2H23, the valuation of BRMS's enterprise value (EV) had already begun to increase since 2021. Its valuation corrected from its peak in May 2022, but remained at a relatively premium level until the end of 2022. Throughout 2023, EBITDA gradually increased, but was no longer accompanied by an increase in valuation. The valuation increase only continued since 3Q24 along with the acceleration of EBITDA growth. The above dynamics can also be seen in the EV/EBITDA chart below, although the very small EBITDA figures for the 2021-2022 period caused the EV/EBITDA figures to become highly volatile. In general, it can be concluded that BRMS's valuation increased first, reflecting expectations of performance growth in the coming years.",

      "content": "Performance improvement starts to be reflected - We assess PTRO will enjoy significant growth in the coming years, originating from the realization of contract backlogs acquired by the company. We expect the company's EBITDA to grow from US$106 million in 2024 to US$257 million in 2028F (CAGR +25%). Meanwhile, we project PTRO's net profit to reach US$74 million in 2028F (CAGR +66%), up from US$10 million in 2024. This growth will be driven by: 1) realization of EPC business in the near future; and 2) increased contribution from contractor business from new mining projects undertaken by PTRO. Ownership Transformation - Since being acquired by the Barito group in early 2024, PTRO has started to refocus on its core business, namely EPC services and mining contracting services, after a shift in strategy where it became a coal mine owner. The company continues to expand by acquiring external projects, while working on its own and affiliated projects such as Petrindo Jaya Kreasi ($CUAN). The success of this expansion caused PTRO's contract backlog to increase from US$2.6 billion at the beginning of 2024 to ~US$3.5 billion in 1H25. EPC Business as a short-term profit driver, followed by mining contractor business - The majority of mines served by PTRO are new mines that require time to reach maximum capacity. Therefore, we expect profits from the EPC business to be realized first from the contract backlog in the next 1-2 years. Going forward, the contribution of mining contractor revenue will slowly increase from 54% to 70% in 2028F, in line with increased production from PTRO's new mining projects. Meanwhile, EPC business revenue is expected to remain stable along with contract awards from Barito group affiliated entities to enhance economic value within the group's ecosystem. Valuation: most expensive among peers, attractive when compared to the Barito group - PTRO is currently trading at a level much more premium than its peers, both in terms of P/E, EV/EBITDA, and P/BV. We assess that PTRO's valuation only looks attractive when compared to other Barito Group issuers. Because of this factor, the movement of PTRO shares will be significantly affected by the movement of other shares in the Barito Group, not just performance prospects. Risks - Some main risks for PTRO we see are: 1) work activity at new mines running slower than expected due to difficult terrain, bad weather, and/or lower commodity prices than expected, thus lowering work volume; 2) high leverage; and 3) more expensive valuation compared to peers, thus risking correction when momentum/sentiment fades or market expectations are not met.",

      "content": "PTRO is a business entity owned by CUAN in the mining services sector, which includes EPC and mining contracting. In 2021-2025, PTRO has undergone two controller changes: 1. 2021: Indika Energy ($INDY) and Lo Kheng Hong 2. 2022-2023: Haji Romo Nitiyudo Wachjo through PT Caraka Reksa Optima 3. 2024-present: Prajogo Pangestu through PT Kreasi Jasa Persada. In the first change of control, PTRO experienced a shift in strategy by being directed to become a coal mine owner. This strategy began to be realized in 2023 through the acquisition of PT Cristian Eka Pratama, a coal mining company in Kutai Barat Regency, East Kalimantan. After undergoing a change of control and management in 2024, PTRO changed its strategy again by refocusing on its core business, namely EPC services and mining contracting services. The company is also required to continue expanding by acquiring external projects while working on its own and affiliated projects such as CUAN. In addition, the company has started to venture into various other sectors within the mining industry, such as port infrastructure, barge operations, as well as coal and mineral trading activities. The success of this expansion is noted by the growth of PTRO's contract backlog by +50% YoY in 2023 and +11% YoY in 2024. In 2024, PTRO's contract backlog increased moderately because a US$1 billion mining contracting contract from Vale Indonesia ($INCO) will only be recorded in 2025. Nevertheless, the impact on PTRO's net profit has not been reflected in the financial statements, considering that the acquired contracts originate from new mines, requiring large operational costs, reflected in large capex up to US$400 million in 2024-2025. Therefore, we see PTRO has the potential to record performance growth in the coming years (multi-year growth), which will be driven by 3 factors, namely: 1) EPC business profit realized from backlogs in 1-2 years; 2) growth in mining segment profit from increased production activity at new mines; and 3) potential for new contract additions from affiliated groups. We project PTRO's net profit will grow from ~US$10 million in 2024 to US$73 million in 2028F (CAGR +66%) with EBITDA rising from US$106 million to US$257 million in 2028F (CAGR +25%). Some key assumptions we use in these projections are as follows: 1. Gradual increase in revenue from the mining contractor segment from US$290 million in 2024 to US$572 million in 2028F. This increase comes from the ramp-up of production from mining service contracts acquired by PTRO in 2023 and 2024. 2. EBITDA margin for the mining contractor segment of 25% in 2025F and continuing to increase to 27.5% in 2026F and 30% in 2027F along with the achievement of economies of scale. 3. The EPC segment consistently records revenue of US$325 million with an EBITDA margin consistently around ~20% due to potential new contract awards from affiliated groups. 4. The coal mining business (PT Cristian Eka Pratama) records a positive operating profit in 2025F and its profit continues to increase along with the increase in coal production volume from 1.4 million tons in 2024 to 2.5 million tons in 2025F, 4 million tons in 2026F, and 5 million tons in 2027-2028F.

This projection is contributed approximately 51% by the EPC business and ~49% by the mining contractor business. Some key assumptions we use in this projection are as follows: 1. EPC Business 2. Completion of all EPC contracts at the Tangguh Block from BP Berau Ltd. obtained in February 2024. 3. Significant progress in EPC services for INCO in Pomalaa obtained in July 2024. 4. Recurring revenue from PT Freeport Indonesia which is relatively consistent in the range of US$90-100 million per year. 5. Mining Contractor Business 6. Revenue from PT Pasir Bara Prima owned by Singaraja Putra ($SINI) starts to rise significantly, where PTRO has signed a mining contract worth US$1.08 billion since August 2024. 7. Increase in revenue from 2 contracts obtained by PTRO since 2022 from PT Indo Bara Pratama and PT Kedap Sayaaq to offset the decline in revenue from non-renewed client contracts in 2024. 8. Although declining, revenue from PT Kideco Jaya Agung owned by INDY is expected to remain stable around US$125 million per year. 9. Coal Mining Business (PT Cristian Eka Pratama) 10. Coal production volume in 2025F rises +85% YoY to 2.5 million tons along with production capacity increase. 11. Increased production capacity has a positive impact on operating profit from the coal mining business, which has been loss-making for the last 2 years due to ongoing capex. We use an assumption of an EBITDA margin of 20% for the EPC business and 25% for the mining contractor business in 2025F. We consider these figures to still be achievable amidst the many operating costs still incurred by PTRO for the preparation of new projects. Going forward, the contribution of mining contractor revenue will increase from 54% to 70% in 2028F along with increased activity in PTRO's new mining projects. The revenue increase also impacts the increase in EBITDA margin due to the achievement of economies of scale. Meanwhile, EPC business revenue is expected to be stable around ~US$300 million per year.

Nevertheless, it is not impossible for PTRO to make jumbo acquisitions in the long term along with the decrease in the net debt to equity ratio from profit growth.",

      "content": "From a valuation perspective, PTRO is currently trading at a level much more premium compared to its peers, both in terms of P/E, P/BV, and EV/EBITDA. As of July 22, 2025, PTRO is trading at a TTM P/E valuation of 189x, P/BV of 10x, and EV/EBITDA of 28x. Meanwhile, PTRO's peers are trading at P/E valuations of 5-98x, P/BV of 1-3x, and EV/EBITDA of 2-10x. PTRO's current EV/EBITDA valuation only looks attractive when compared to other Barito group issuers (excluding CDIA), such as BREN, TPIA, BRPT, and CUAN. Although we assess that PTRO has a faster growth prospect compared to the renewable energy and petrochemical businesses, the group valuation factor significantly influences the movement of PTRO shares along with the movement of other shares in the Barito Group, not just performance prospects. Investors need to consider the sentiment dynamics towards the entire Barito group, including external factors such as changes in global index policies. Positive sentiment towards other shares in the Barito group has the potential to push PTRO's valuation to a more premium level, and vice versa. Another factor that investors need to consider, in our opinion, is PTRO's smaller market cap (relative to the group).",
