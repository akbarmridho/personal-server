      "content": "The Ministry of Finance on Monday (22/9) presented the realization of the State Budget (APBN) up to August 2025. Key points are as follows:\n\nState Revenue Still Contracting, Below Seasonal Trend\nState revenue for the first eight months of 2025 (8M25) reached IDR 1,638.7 trillion (-7.8% YoY), equivalent to about 57% of the 2025 APBN outlook (versus 8M24: about 63% of the 2024 APBN realization). Tax revenue – the main contributor to state revenue – still declined by -5.1% YoY during 8M25. The Ministry of Finance attributes the decline in tax revenue to restitution factors, noting that gross tax revenue still increased by +2.1% YoY during 8M25.\n\nState Expenditure Accelerated, Relatively Aligned with Seasonal Trend\nState expenditure for 8M25 reached IDR 1,960.3 trillion (+1.5% YoY), equivalent to about 56% of the 2025 APBN outlook (versus 8M24: about 58% of the 2024 APBN realization). Both central government spending (+1.5% YoY) and transfers to regions (+1.7% YoY) recorded positive growth. The expenditure trend also shows acceleration compared with previous months. For comparison, state expenditure in the first half of 2025 (1H25) grew only +0.6% YoY, while the realization for the first five months of 2025 (5M25) was still down -11% YoY.\n\nThe Ministry also reported that as of 8 September 2025, the implementation of the Free Nutritious Meal program had reached 22.71 million beneficiaries with a budget realization of about IDR 13 trillion, only 18.3% of the program's budget ceiling of IDR 71 trillion. Previously, Finance Minister Purbaya said that the ministry would continue to monitor the budget realization of government programs and reallocate funds if implementation is slow.\n\nThe APBN 2025 realization for 8M25 resulted in a deficit of IDR 321.6 trillion, equivalent to 1.35% of GDP (versus 8M24: 0.69% of GDP).\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe assess that the acceleration of government spending until the end of 2025 is needed to revive economic growth in the second half of 2025. In addition to overall spending acceleration, the government has launched several initiatives such as liquidity injection and an additional stimulus package for the economy.",

      "content": "- The House of Representatives on Tuesday (23/9) passed the 2026 State Budget Law with a deficit target of 2.68% of GDP and an economic growth target of +5.4% YoY. The 2026 APBN also targets inflation at 2.5% YoY, the rupiah exchange rate at 16,500 per US dollar, a 10-year SBN yield at 6.9%, Indonesian Crude Price at US$70 per barrel, oil lifting at 610,000 barrels per day, and gas lifting at 984,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\n- Indonesia and the European Union on Tuesday (23/9) signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement (IEU-CEPA) in Bali. The agreement will eliminate tariffs for 80% of Indonesian export products to the EU, including key commodities such as palm oil, fisheries, and textiles. Conversely, Indonesia will eliminate import duties on 98.5% of goods from the EU and simplify entry procedures for EU products, including cars and food items. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto expects the agreement to take effect on 1 January 2027. The government expects EU-bound exports to double within the first five years of implementation.\n- Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday (22/9) that the government will extend the 100% government-covered value-added tax (PPN DTP) incentive for the housing sector until 2026. Under this scheme, the government will fully bear VAT on the purchase of newly built ready-to-move houses with a maximum selling price of IDR 2 billion. For properties priced around IDR 2-5 billion, the VAT exemption applies only to the first IDR 2 billion. Kontan reported that the government has prepared a PPN DTP incentive ceiling of IDR 3.4 trillion for 2026, targeting 40,000 new housing units.\n- Bank Indonesia recorded that broad money (M2) in August 2025 grew +7.6% YoY to IDR 9,657.1 trillion (vs. July 2025: +6.6% YoY).

Kontan reported that Anggito's name was not in the selection list of the LPS committee in July 2025, but later appeared in a letter sent by President Prabowo Subianto to the House. Finance Minister Purbaya confirmed that Anggito will resign as deputy finance minister after being officially appointed as LPS chair.\n- The President Director of Wijaya Karya (WIKA), Agung Budi Waskito, said that the company recorded new contract values of IDR 5.24 trillion during 8M25 (-61% YoY). The new contracts were dominated by the construction support industry sector at 49.8%, followed by infrastructure and building at 33.8%.",
