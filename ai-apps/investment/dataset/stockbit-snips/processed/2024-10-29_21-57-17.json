      "title": "MYOR 3Q24: Loss on Exchange and Margin Pressured Again, Below Expectation",
      "content": "Mayora Indah (MYOR) recorded low net profit in 3Q24 amounting to 298 billion rupiah (-63% YoY, -51% QoQ). This result keeps the net profit for 9M24 relatively stable at 2 trillion rupiah (-1% YoY). We assess this achievement is below expectations because it is only equivalent to 60% of the consensus FY24 net profit estimates. For comparison, MYOR's net profit in 9M23 was equivalent to 63% of the total FY23 net profit. Exchange Loss Due to Rupiah Strengthening Net profit in 3Q24 was also suppressed by a net exchange loss of 257 billion rupiah (3Q23: profit of 33 billion rupiah, 2Q24: profit of 98 billion rupiah). This was caused by the strengthening of the Rupiah against the US Dollar to the level of ~15,100 by the end of September 2024. For information, MYOR holds a net cash position in US dollars amounting to ~280 million US dollars as of the end of September 2024, thus the company will incur exchange losses when the US Dollar weakens against the Rupiah. Operating Profit Pressed by Declining Gross Profit Margin and Rising OPEX Operationally, operating profit was recorded at 726 billion rupiah in 3Q24 (-31% YoY, +5% QoQ). This realization brought the operating profit for 9M24 to 2.7 trillion rupiah (-2% YoY), slightly below expectations as it amounted to 63% of the consensus FY24 estimate (vs. 9M23: 65% of FY23). The weak operating profit in 3Q24 was mainly caused by: 1) continued pressure from cocoa and coffee raw material prices on the gross profit margin; and 2) an increase in opex. The gross profit margin decreased again in 3Q24 to 20.5% (vs. 3Q23: 26.9%, 2Q24: 23.5%), marking a decline for 2 consecutive quarters. This result caused the gross profit margin for 9M24 to drop to 23.9% (vs. 9M23: 26.7%), creating a risk that the gross profit margin for FY24 will be below management guidance which targets a minimum level of 25%. With the pressure still being felt on the gross profit margin, MYOR will likely implement plans to raise product selling prices again in the remainder of this year. MYOR management will hold an earnings call on November 5, 2024, where we will focus on the company's gross profit margin dynamics. We assess that the gross profit margin is the main issue for MYOR, considering that the company's revenue grew solidly to 9.4 trillion rupiah in 3Q24 (+17% YoY, +26% QoQ). This growth brought revenue for 9M24 up +12% YoY to 25.6 trillion rupiah, in line with the new guidance provided by management in the range of +10-12%. Meanwhile, opex increased, especially in general and administrative expenses (+29% YoY, +15% QoQ) along with a surge in salary expenses (+21% YoY, +17% QoQ). We expect this cost increase is related to the opening of the company's 2 new factories. Key Takeaway Although MYOR in 4Q24 potentially posts an exchange loss reversal due to the strengthening of the US Dollar exchange rate, we assess that the company's success in facing challenges from the gross profit margin side will be a key factor for its stock price movement. This is considering that cocoa and chocolate raw material prices are still holding at relatively high levels as of now.",
