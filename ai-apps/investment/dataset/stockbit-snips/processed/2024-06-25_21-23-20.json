      "title": "Government Plans to Extend Credit Restructuring Relaxation Until 2025",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that President Joko Widodo requested the relaxation of credit restructuring for Covid-19 affected parties to be extended until 2025. This plan is intended to reduce the burden on the banking industry in provisioning for losses due to failures in paying People's Business Credit (KUR). Airlangga mentioned that this proposal will be followed up through the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) and the Governor of Bank Indonesia. Responding to this proposal, the Chairman of the OJK Board of Commissioners, Mahendra Siregar, stated that his party will take steps to deepen and evaluate the credit restructuring program that has been running. The relaxation of credit restructuring for Covid-19 affected parties began in March 2020 and was supposed to end in March 2024. Although its validity period has ended, OJK still allows banks to continue with restructurings that are already in process. With the end of the relaxation, restructured credits that are still problematic will no longer be categorized as smooth (lancar), but will shift to the problematic category. Consequently, banks must bear the provisioning cost (cost of credit) to form reserves against these problematic loans. Here is a summary of the development of credit restructuring affected by Covid-19: [Image data snippet]. Key Takeaway: We assess that if this proposal is implemented, it can have a positive impact on bank net profit in the short term due to the reduction in provisioning costs resulting from the recategorization of problematic loans. On the other hand, if the restructured loans do not improve, this policy in the long run will only delay the categorization of non-performing loans.",
