      "content": "The Merdeka Group reported its 2Q25 performance where Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA) and Merdeka Battery Materials (MBMA) showed contrasting results. MDKA recorded a net loss of US$12 million in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: US$4 million loss, 2Q24: US$3 million profit). This result brought MDKA's net loss for 1H25 to US$16 million (vs. 1H24: US$13 million loss), below consensus expectations which projected a net profit of US$3 million for 2025F. Conversely, MBMA recorded a net profit of US$9 million in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: US$3 million loss, 2Q24: US$17 million profit). This result brought MBMA's net profit for 1H25 to US$6 million (-71% YoY), below consensus expectations, equivalent to only 23% of the consensus 2025F net profit estimate.",

      "content": "Gold (Weakening) - Although the average realized gold selling price rose significantly to US$3,207 per troy ounce (+16% QoQ, +42% YoY), realized gold sales volume dropped to 22,739 oz (-38% QoQ, -9% YoY). This is potentially caused by massive earlier sales in 1Q25 where MDKA sold 36,796 oz of gold despite only producing 25,481 oz of gold. In terms of production, the gold production volume increased +2% YoY to 50,624 tons during 1H25, equivalent to 46-51% of the company's guidance, with a stable cash cost at US$1,125 per troy ounce, which is within company guidance (US$1,100-1,250 per troy ounce).\nCopper (Weakening) - Copper sales volume fell -41% QoQ to 1,742 tons, in line with the planned cessation of mining activities at the Wetar mine expected in 3Q25. Nevertheless, copper production will continue through processing remaining stockpiles, with leaching and copper recovery processes expected to continue until 1Q27. In terms of production, copper production volume decreased -37% YoY to 4,235 tons during 1H25, equivalent to 35-42% of company guidance, with cash cost rising +13% YoY to US$3.0/lb, which is within company guidance (US$3.0-3.2/lb).",

Meanwhile, cash cost significantly dropped from ~US$13 per wmt to US$11 per wmt, following a change in the ore logistics system from hauling using dump trucks to slurry pipes. In terms of production, limonite ore production volume increased +43% YoY to 4.3 million tons during 1H25, equivalent to 29-34% of company guidance.\nNPI (Improving) - MBMA successfully controlled the NPI cash cost to US$9,719 per ton (-3% QoQ, -6% YoY), below company guidance (US$11,000 per ton), while the average realized selling price remained stable at US$11,500 per ton (-1% QoQ, -0% YoY). In terms of production, NPI production volume decreased -23% YoY to 33,045 tons during 1H25, equivalent to 41-47% of the company's new, lower guidance of 70-80 thousand tons compared to the previous guidance of 80-87 thousand tons.\nNickel Matte (Neutral) - Nickel matte production has been halted since 1Q25 due to thin margins. Production may potentially resume in 4Q25 at the earliest if price conditions improve.",

      "content": "Following the release of 2Q25 performance and earnings calls, MBMA closed up +25% (upper price limit/ARA), while MDKA gained +7.25% in trading on Friday (26/9). Between the projects currently being developed by the Merdeka Group, we assess that MBMA's near-term performance outlook is more visible, while MDKA's performance outlook tends to materialize in the medium term. MBMA's NPI segment is expected to maintain cash costs below US$10,000 per ton so that profitability remains secure, while limonite sales potential will increase along with the operation of affiliated HPAL facilities. Furthermore, the commissioning progress of the AIM project is relatively good with full production expectations in 2026. On the other hand, MDKA's Tujuh Bukit gold production is projected to meet guidance (100-110 thousand oz) with a more even gold sales distribution (between quarters) in 2H25. Meanwhile, Merdeka Gold Resources' (EMAS) Pani project is expected to produce its first gold in 1Q26. For copper, the contribution from Wetar will continue to decline, while exploration at the Tujuh Bukit project still lacks a definite production schedule.",

Purbaya explained that he wanted to lower the rate, but the producers requested that the amount remain unchanged. He added that his main focus now is cleaning up the illegal cigarette market both from abroad and domestically by forming a special system for the tobacco product industry (IHT).\nThe Institute of International Finance reported that global debt hit a new record high of US$337.7 trillion at the end of 2Q25. This was driven by the easing of global financial conditions, the weakening of the US dollar, and a more accommodative stance from major central banks. The countries recording the highest debt increases (in US dollars) were China, France, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\nUS economic growth in 2Q25 was revised sharply higher to 3.8% annualized in the final report (vs. 3.3% in the second estimate), marking the highest increase in the last 2 years. Strong consumer spending and business investment were growth drivers, but growth momentum is starting to slow down due to the effects of tariffs and policy uncertainty.\nUS President, Donald Trump, announced on Thursday (25/9) that the US will impose a 100% import tariff on branded drugs, a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks, and 30-50% on cabinets and furniture. The announcement - made on the social media platform Truth Social - did not include details such as whether the tariffs would be added to the country of origin tariffs or if there were exceptions for countries that already have trade agreements with the US. The newly announced tariffs are planned to take effect on October 1, 2025.\nShareholders of Fuji Finance Indonesia (FUJI), Jhon Veter Firdaus, bought ~6.3 million FUJI shares at an average price of 790 rupiah per share on September 24, 2025.

The net profit performance during 8M25 was supported by a decrease in provision expenses (-44% YoY), although PPOP still dropped -12% YoY due to a weakening Net Margin Income (NMI) (-4% YoY) and an increase in opex (+5% YoY). The weakening NMI during 8M25 aligns with financing contraction of -4% YoY (vs. 1H25: -3% YoY, 8M24: -13% YoY), but Net Interest Income slightly decreased to 23% (vs. 8M24: 24%).",
