      "title": "TPMA Forms New JV, Potential Net Profit Addition up to +15%",
      "content": "Trans Power Marine (TPMA) announced a cooperation with PT Samudra Investama Maju to establish a joint venture named PT Trans Ocean Permata (TOP) which will engage in coal transportation and logistics services in the South Sumatra region. TPMA explained that TOP has initial capital of 20 billion rupiah, with the company's ownership reaching 51%. In the next 2-3 years, TOP plans to acquire 20 sets of tugboats and barges and 2 floating crane units with a capex of 90 million US dollars. This expansion will be financed by 20% from internal cash, while the remainder will come from bank debt. This is not the first time TPMA has expanded through a joint venture. Previously, in 2021, the company formed a joint venture named PT Trans Logistik Perkasa (TLP) with T&J Industrial Holding Limited (TJI) - a business entity of Tsingshan Holding Group - and Pacific Pelayaran Indonesia. TLP itself was formed to transport Tsingshan's nickel products in Maluku. The company already owns 41 sets of tugboats and barges as of 1H24, with the fleet size targeted to reach 60 sets of tugboats and barges in 2025. Key Takeaway: The formation of this joint venture has the potential to become a growth catalyst for TPMA's financial performance going forward. Based on our conservative estimation, TOP has the potential to book revenue of 4.9-10.9 million US dollars in its first year of operation, equivalent to 5.4-12.1% of our FY24F estimate for TPMA's revenue post-consolidation with PT Bahtera Energi Samudra Tuah (BEST). We also estimate TOP's net profit in the first year of operation to reach 752.6 thousand - 1.7 million US dollars, equivalent to 2.7-6% of our FY24F estimate for TPMA's net profit. Some assumptions we used are: The addition of 20 sets of tugboats and barges and 2 floating crane units is carried out within a 3-year period. Assumption of revenue per fleet of 1.1 billion rupiah per month for tugboats and barges, equivalent to TLP which has the lowest revenue per fleet compared to TPMA and BEST, based on our calculation. Assumption of revenue per fleet of 7 billion rupiah per month for floating cranes, equivalent to the revenue per floating crane fleet of TPMA. Assumption of a net profit margin of 30% and reducing non-controlling interest by 49%. If TOP completes all its fleet acquisitions, we estimate TPMA's revenue and net profit can increase by 26.8 million US dollars and 4.1 million US dollars, respectively, equivalent to 29.5% and 14.7% of our FY24F revenue and net profit estimate for TPMA.",
