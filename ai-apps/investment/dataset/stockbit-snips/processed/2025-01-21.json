      "title": "Revision of DHE SDA: 100% Allocation for 1 Year",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Tuesday (21/1) that the government will revise the foreign exchange placement rule for export proceeds of natural resources (DHE SDA) to 100% for a period of one year. The proportion and tenor of the placement are larger and longer than the existing rule, which required a minimum of 30% for three months. The revision will take effect on 1 March 2025 for exporters of natural resources with export values of at least USD 250,000. The revision is currently being harmonised and will be issued soon. Airlangga claimed that the government will provide many incentives for the mineral, coal and other natural resource sectors, except for the oil and gas sector. The incentives include: - A 0% income tax rate on interest income from DHE SDA placement instruments. - Exporters can use the DHE SDA placement instrument as collateral for back‑to‑back rupiah credit from banks or Investment Management Institutions (LPI) for domestic rupiah needs. - Exporters can use a swap instrument with a bank if they need rupiah for their business activities. - Funding guaranteed by collateral – including cash collateral, giro accounts or savings deposits that meet certain requirements – will be exempt from the maximum credit provision limit (BMPK), so funding that uses the DHE SDA placement as collateral will not affect the gearing ratio against equity. - DHE SDA can be converted into rupiah and will be counted as a reduction of the placement obligation percentage. - Foreign exchange instruments can be used to pay state levies such as taxes, royalties and dividends. The revision aims to increase the supply of foreign exchange in the country to ease pressure on the rupiah. On Tuesday (21/1) the rupiah had fallen 0.9% month‑on‑month to a level of 16,335 per US dollar. Airlangga claimed that the revision could increase the country's foreign exchange by up to USD 90 billion, equivalent to 58% of the 2024 realization of USD 156 billion. However, the revision was criticised by exporters. Before Airlangga announced the change, the Chairman of the Indonesian Exporters Association, Benny Soetrisno, said on Monday (20/1) that the revision would disrupt exporters' finances because export proceeds would have to be placed domestically while financing has traditionally come from foreign financial institutions. To ease the burden, Airlangga said last week that the term‑deposit yield on DHE SDA placement would be higher than Singapore's, ranging between 4.12% and 4.48%, though he did not provide further details. Last week, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo also said that Bank Indonesia is preparing SUVBI and SVBI as additional instruments for DHE SDA placement, in addition to existing instruments such as foreign‑exchange term deposits and FX swaps. Key Takeaway: In brief, the DHE SDA placement revision could provide a positive sentiment for banking issuers as foreign exchange liquidity increases, while there is operational working‑capital liquidity risk for exporters lacking strong cash balance sheets. Further clarity and detail on the incentives are still needed to assess the impact on exporters.",
