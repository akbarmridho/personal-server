      "title": "BMRI 5M25: Net Profit Flat YoY",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded net profit for the bank only segment of 4.5 trillion rupiah in May 2025 (-2% YoY, +26% MoM). This result brought the net profit for 5M25 to 19.7 trillion rupiah (+0% YoY), relatively in line with consensus expectations which project consolidated net profit for 2025F to be flat (+0.3%) YoY. On a monthly basis, BMRI's performance increased in May 2025 post-Eid al-Fitr. The realization of the company's performance for 5M25 - which generally tends to resemble 1Q25 performance - indicates that the performance trend in 2Q25 will not be much different from 1Q25, unless there is a significant change in performance in June 2025.\n\nRevenue More Supported by Non-II Than NII\n\nNon-Interest Income (Non-II) grew +6% YoY in May 2025, leading Non-II to increase +13% YoY during 5M25. Meanwhile, Net Interest Income (NII) slightly decreased by -1% YoY in May 2025, and only grew +4% YoY during 5M25.\n\nThe low NII performance is primarily caused by a significant increase in interest expense amidst tight liquidity conditions. This is reflected in the Net Interest Margin (NIM) which remained low in May 2025 at 4.39%, resulting in the NIM for 5M25 standing at 4.45% (vs. 5M24: 4.86%; 1Q25: 4.46%). The NIM for 5M25 is relatively lower compared to the 2025 guidance from management (after adjusting bank only vs. consolidated).\n\nCompared to 1Q25, the annual growth of Non-II and NII during 5M25 is not significantly different. During 1Q25, Non-II and NII grew by +15% YoY and +6% YoY, respectively.\n\nPPOP Flat Due to Increase in Opex\n\nOpex increased +6% YoY in May 2025, so opex during 5M25 rose +22% YoY. This increase offset income growth, causing Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) to tend to be flat (-1% YoY) both in May 2025 and during 5M25.\n\nProvision expense rose +7% YoY in May 2025, but was still down -6% YoY during 5M25. This decrease in provision expense is reflected in a lower Cost of Credit (CoC), at 0.7% during 5M25 (vs. 5M24: 0.87%), which is relatively lower compared to the 2025 guidance from management (after adjusting bank only vs. consolidated).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that liquidity remains the main challenge, so easing liquidity has the potential to be a positive catalyst for BMRI. In expectation terms, performance pressure has - at least partially - been anticipated by the market, where consensus has reduced consolidated net profit estimates for 2025F by -3%/-9% in the last 3/6 months. As of Wednesday (25/6), BMRI is trading at a valuation of 1.46x 1-Year Forward P/BV, nearly touching -1 Standard Deviation (1.42x) below the 5-year historical average. At this level, we see BMRI offering a minimum dividend yield potential of ~7%.",

      "content": "Reuters reports that China and India - which are major global coal importers - are cutting thermal coal imports from Indonesia and preferring higher-calorie coal from other countries because the decline in global coal prices makes high-quality coal more competitive. The director of coal trading company I-Energy Natural Resources, Vasudev Pamnani, stated that high-calorie coal can generate more energy per US dollar paid even if the price per ton is more expensive. Pamnani estimated that 1 million tons of high-calorie coal can replace 1.2-1.5 million tons of coal from Indonesia. Meanwhile, an analyst from commodity analysis firm Kpler, Zhiyuan Li, stated that medium and low-calorie thermal coal from Indonesia is currently competing with supplies from Russia, which are being discounted at the same value. Kpler noted that Indonesian thermal coal export volume during 5M25 fell -12% YoY to 187 million tons.",
