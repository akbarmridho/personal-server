      "content": "Minister of Investment, Rosan Roeslani, stated that the government is targeting investment realization of 1,905 trillion rupiah in 2025, an increase of +15.5% YoY compared to the 2024 target. Cumulatively, the government targets total investment realization of 11,855 trillion rupiah in 2025-2029. Here is the breakdown: Rosan claimed that the investment realization target of 1,905 trillion rupiah in 2025 can boost economic growth up to +5.6% YoY. This figure is higher than the government's target of +5.2% YoY and the projection from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at +5.1% YoY. Rosan mentioned that the sectors becoming the focus for future investment are green investment, connectivity infrastructure, energy transition and downstreaming, and export-based investment. On the other hand, Rosan stated that the limited budget for the Ministry of Investment in 2025 could hinder the achievement of the investment realization target. The budget ceiling for the Ministry of Investment itself decreased by -44.5% YoY to ~681.9 billion rupiah in 2025, only equivalent to 43.4% of the planned budget needs.",
