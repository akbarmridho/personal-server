Luhut explained that the government plans to provide a stimulus first to the middle-class population through social assistance (bansos), intended as a cushion to mitigate the impact of the VAT hike. The assistance will not be given as direct cash aid (BLT), but as an electricity subsidy.",

      "content": "Alamtri Resources Indonesia (ADRO) shares fell 24.8% and touched the lower auto-reject (ARB) level at 2,760 rupiah per share on Thursday (28/11). The decline coincided with the ex-dividend date for a dividend of 2.6 billion US dollars that ADRO will distribute on 6 December 2024. ADRO will announce the dividend per share tomorrow, Friday (29/11). Assuming the dividend is paid at the maximum amount and using an exchange rate of 15,811 rupiah per US dollar, the dividend equals approximately 1,352 rupiah per share. In addition to the ex-dividend date, today is also the ex-rights date for the public offering rights (PUPS) of Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI), ADRO's thermal coal subsidiary that will be spun off soon. The PUPS price for AADI is estimated between 2.4 and 2.6 billion US dollars, depending on the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) on the first day the issuer lists on the exchange. Using the same exchange rate of 15,811 rupiah per US dollar, the price range translates to roughly 5,550-5,950 rupiah per share. Investors who have received AADI PUPS and wish to exercise them can do so between 6 and 10 December 2024. AADI itself will list on the IDX on 5 December 2024, with the initial public offering scheduled for 29 November-3 December 2024. The IPO price for AADI was set at 5,550 rupiah per share.",
