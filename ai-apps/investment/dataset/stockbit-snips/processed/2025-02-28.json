The plan notes that low purchasing power, reflected in deflation of government‑controlled price components and volatile prices, is a key driver of the decline.

      "title": "BBRI 1M25: Net Profit -58% YoY, Provision Expenses Projected to Decrease",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded net profit (bank only) of 2 trillion rupiah in January 2025, down 58% YoY and 58% MoM, mainly due to: 1) provision expenses (credit cost) swelling to 5.6 trillion rupiah (vs Jan 2024: 2 trillion rupiah, Dec 2024: 1.2 trillion rupiah); and 2) Net Interest Margin (NIM) falling to 6.15% (vs Jan 2024: 6.63%, Dec 2024: 6.94%). Earlier, BBRI management in an FY24 earnings call mid‑month said there could be a one‑off adjustment from modification loss and front‑loading provisions affecting NIM and credit cost in 1H25, without giving specific numbers. Although a NIM decline and provision surge were expected, the market was surprised by the actual performance, causing BBRI shares to drop 7.4% today, Friday (28/2). In today's call, management explained that of the total 5.6 trillion rupiah provision expense (bank only) booked in January 2025, about 2 trillion rupiah is systematic provision (overall credit portfolio assessment). Approximately 3.5 trillion rupiah is additional management overlay linked to potential risk from the restructuring of Kupedes micro‑segment credit. Management said the overlay may appear in coming months but in smaller amounts, so provision expenses are projected to decline. BBRI confirmed that guidance for credit costs of about 300‑320 basis points consolidated for FY25 already incorporates the management overlay recorded in January 2025. Even though provision expenses are projected to fall, achieving the 300‑320 bps credit cost guidance for 2025 will depend heavily on key assumptions: 1) consolidated loan and financing growth of about 7‑9% YoY; and 2) completion of the Kupedes credit restructuring. Therefore, BBRI does not rule out the possibility of a consolidated net profit decline this year. Although credit performance and NIM remain low early in the year, BBRI expects credit growth and liquidity conditions to improve in 2Q25. Management also said dividend discussions for FY2024 point to a dividend payout ratio (DPR) around 85%, higher than the 80% DPR in FY2023. With an 85% DPR, the final dividend could be 204 rupiah per share, implying a dividend yield of 6.1% based on today's closing price of 3,360 rupiah. Future DPR policy will be a wait‑and‑see as BBRI operates under Danantara. Regarding Net Interest Income (NII) which fell 8% YoY, pressuring NIM in January 2025, management explained a reclassification of interest income in FY2024, including January 2024, where part of non‑interest fee income became interest income. Combined (NII + Non‑II), total BBRI revenue in January 2025 was essentially flat YoY (-0.1%) at 13 trillion rupiah. Key Takeaway: BBRI's performance recovery in the coming months will be crucial for investors, focusing on provision expenses, credit acceleration, and liquidity. Valuation: BBRI trades at 1.52x 1‑Year Forward P/BV, below the -2 standard deviation (1.62x) 10‑year historical average and the lowest since the Covid‑19 pandemic (1.32x). Risk: If performance recovery is slow, net profit FY25 consensus could be trimmed. Consensus projects FY25 net profit at a relatively flat 60.7 trillion rupiah (vs FY24: 60.2 trillion rupiah).",

The result was driven by credit cost (CoC) easing to 0.82% in January 2025 (-32 bps YoY, -101 bps MoM), better than management's ±1% guidance and the lowest since January 2022. Pre‑Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) grew modestly +1.4% YoY, despite operating expenses rising +7.4% YoY and NIM falling to 3.71% (-6 bps YoY, -82 bps MoM), below management's 4‑4.2% guidance. Previously, BBNI indicated NIM would stay weak in 1H25 before strengthening in 2H25 due to tight liquidity.
