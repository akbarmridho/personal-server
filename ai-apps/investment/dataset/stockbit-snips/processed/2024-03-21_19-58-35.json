      "title": "The Fed Still Projects 3 Interest Rate Cuts in 2024",
      "content": "The Fed decided to hold the benchmark interest rate in the range of 5.25-5.5% in the meeting on Wednesday (20/3) local time, in line with consensus expectations. In the meeting, Fed officials still projected an interest rate cut of 75 bps throughout 2024. This projection has not changed from the projection made in December 2023. Assuming each cut is 25 bps, the Fed will cut rates 3 times in 2024. However, the Head of the Fed, Jerome Powell, said that they would be more cautious because US inflation data at the beginning of 2024 still exceeded consensus expectations. Powell also mentioned that the timing of the rate cut would depend on further economic data. On Thursday (21/3), probability analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool showed that the market expects the Fed's interest rate cut to start in June 2024, with a probability reaching 67.4%. This probability increased compared to 65.6% on March 13, 2024. Following the Fed's announcement, the three main US indices strengthened on Wednesday (20/3), with Dow Jones +1.03%, S&P 500 +0.88%, and Nasdaq +1.25%. Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) fell -0.18% to the level of 103.2. On the same day, the 10-year US government bond yield fell approximately -10 bps to the level of 4.26%. Positive sentiment also occurred in gold, which strengthened by +1.2% to the level of 2,204.02 US dollars per ounce.",

However, it is important to remember that there is still uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of the cuts. Interest rate cuts could potentially be a positive catalyst for several sectors, namely banking, property, technology, and gold. On Thursday (21/3), the IHSG strengthened +0.1%, with the finance sector +0.45%, property +1.11%, and technology +0.91%.",

The inauguration is scheduled to take place on October 20, 2024. Bloomberg noted that the Indonesian bond market experienced a foreign outflow of 1.1 billion US dollars since the election voting on February 14, 2024. Strategist at Goldman Sachs, Danny Suwanapruti, said that this trend was driven by investor concerns over potential fiscal easing by the new government which promised a free lunch program during the campaign, but without details on how the program would be financed. The Swiss central bank decided to cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 bps to the level of 1.5%, exceeding consensus expectations which predicted the rate would be held steady. This move also marks the first central bank to ease its interest rate policy. This decision was made following the reported inflation rate falling to 1.2% in February 2023.",
