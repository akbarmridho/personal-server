      "title": "Danantara Plans Restructuring & Consolidation of State-Owned Enterprises Until End 2025",
      "content": "COO of Danantara, Dony Oskaria, said on Wednesday (23 July) that the entity has 22 work programs to be carried out until the end of 2025. Although not explained in detail, Dony stated that the programs cover restructuring, consolidation, and business development of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), consisting of:\n\n1. Restructuring in 4 sectors: airline business, steel manufacturing, high-speed rail, and insurance.\n2. Consolidation of businesses in 9 sectors: construction, fertilizer, hospitals, hotels, sugar, oil downstream, insurance, asset management, and industrial estates.\n3. Business development targeting cooperative sector, food, batteries, cement, sharia banking, telecommunications, and shipyard industry.\n\nRegarding the consolidation plan for BUMN Karya, Dony said the entity will consolidate subsidiaries that are not directly related to the core business. The BUMN Karya consolidation plan is not new, as the discussion has been present since 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Member of DPR Commission VI, Ahmad Labib, reminded Danantara to avoid a conglomerate model in implementing the consolidation and transformation program. Ahmad said that the conglomerate model previously applied to SOEs was unproductive and often a source of inefficiency in the past.\n\nKontan reported that Danantara and Commission XI of DPR also held a closed meeting on Wednesday (23 July). Chairman of Commission XI, Mukhamad Misbakhun, explained that the meeting was held in closed session because some information conveyed by Danantara was feared to affect the market, as the information was considered insider.\n\nKey Takeaway:\nThe success of Danantara in revitalizing and developing SOEs can strengthen Danantara’s own capitalisation. However, execution is the key factor that investors need to watch, besides the details of the programs/schemes to be implemented.\n\nSince Danantara’s launch on 24 February 2025, the overall sentiment for SOE stocks has been fairly positive. Since that date, the IDX BUMN20 index has risen by 6.24%, with $ANTM (+85%), $PGEO (+69%) and $PTPP (+53%) as the top three issuers with the highest share price gains. The IDX BUMN20 increase is higher than IDX30 (+3.58%) and LQ45 (+3.88%), which are more concentrated on large SOE banks.",
