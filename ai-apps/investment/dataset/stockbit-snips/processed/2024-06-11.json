      "title": "Car Sales Slowdown Begins",
      "content": "Wholesale car sales in Indonesia in May 2024 were recorded at 71,263 units, up +46.5% month‑on‑month but down -13.3% year‑on‑year. Cumulatively over the first five months of 2024, wholesale car sales reached only 334,897 units (‑21% YoY), fulfilling just 30.4% of the 2024 target set by Gaikindo at the 1.1 million‑unit level.\n\nIn May 2024, Astra International (ASII) recorded wholesale car sales of 40,876 units, up +54.1% MoM but down -12.5% YoY. This result brings ASII's sales for the first five months of 2024 to 187,446 units, down -19.1% YoY. The smaller decline in ASII's sales compared with competitors on an annual basis – both in May 2024 and over the first five months – increased ASII's market share relative to last year. Brand‑wise, Daihatsu supported ASII's sales with a far more moderate decline than Toyota + Lexus.\n\nMeanwhile, sales from ASII's competitors fell deeper, with total non‑ASII brand sales in May 2024 reaching 30,387 units (+37.5% MoM, -14.4% YoY). Cumulatively, total non‑ASII brand sales for the first five months of 2024 amounted to 147,451 units, down -23.3% YoY. Wuling gained market share during the first five months, while Honda and Hyundai experienced declines throughout the year.\n\nAfter the release of the May 2024 wholesale car sales data, Gaikindo kept its sales target at the 1.1 million‑unit level.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAlthough wholesale car sales appear difficult to meet Gaikindo's target, we assess that signs of improvement are emerging. This is reflected in the slowdown of the sales decline, from around -20% YoY in previous months to about -10% YoY in May 2024.\n\nTherefore, monthly wholesale car sales should be monitored by investors. Given ASII's valuation is already low (1‑Year Forward P/E 6x, P/BV 0.85x), a continued recovery signal in car sales could be responded to positively by market participants.",

      "content": "President Joko Widodo said that the rupiah exchange rate in the range of 16,200‑16,300 per US dollar remains in a good position, and noted that all countries experience pressure on their currencies against the US dollar. This comment contrasts with Economy Minister Airlangga Hartarto, who in April 2024 asked state‑owned enterprises to postpone large US‑dollar purchases in order to reduce depreciation pressure on the rupiah. Since the start of the year, the rupiah has depreciated -5.5% year‑to‑date to a level of 16,295 per US dollar as of Tuesday (11/6).\n\nNational Food Agency head Arief Prasetyo Adi forecasts that rice prices will rise in the next 2‑3 months due to a decline in national rice production in the second half of 2024. He also mentioned that rice prices could surge beyond the highest retail price (HET) set on 5 June 2024. Based on the BPS sample‑area framework, rice production from January to July 2024 has a deficit of up to 2.6 million tons.\n\nOJK Executive Inarno Djajadi said there are 141 pipeline IPO offerings with an indicative total value of 56.92 trillion rupiah as of Monday (10/6). Among these, 81 issuers are queued for IPOs with a combined indicative value of 11.85 trillion rupiah.\n\nInarno also explained that the Special Monitoring Board policy with a full call auction (FCA) mechanism applied on the IDX is a best practice for trading penny stocks, following the New York Stock Exchange and studied since 2019. With the FCA mechanism, stocks that were stuck at a price of 50 rupiah per share can become liquidly traded with a more reasonable price formation.\n\nOJK recorded that total household debt through online lending reached 62.74 trillion rupiah in April 2024, up +24.16% year‑on‑year. OJK PVML Executive Agusman said the aggregate non‑performing credit risk (TWP 90) as of April 2024 remained at 2.79%, down from March 2024's 2.94%.\n\nThe Ministry of State‑Owned Enterprises officially appointed former Finance Minister and National Campaign Team (TKN) member Fuad Bawazier as President Commissioner of MIND ID. In addition, the ministry appointed Grace Natalie as Commissioner of MIND ID.",
