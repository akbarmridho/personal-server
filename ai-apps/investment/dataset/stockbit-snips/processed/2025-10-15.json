      "title": "Finance Minister Purbaya Revises Upward Economic Growth Projection for 4Q25 and Opens Possibility to Reduce VAT",
      "content": "Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said on Tuesday (14/10) that economic growth could reach +5.67% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2025, higher than the previous projection he gave last week at +5.5%. According to Purbaya, the acceleration of growth in 4Q25 – which will be driven by a new stimulus that the government will announce soon – could generate capital inflows, causing the rupiah to potentially appreciate. At the end of September 2025, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told the Financial Times that the government is planning a stimulus worth US$2 billion (approximately IDR 33 trillion) to boost consumer spending during the Christmas and New Year holiday period. The last stimulus the government provided was a package of IDR 16.2 trillion announced in mid-September 2025. For 2026, the government will launch several fiscal incentive schemes: (1) Extension of the 100% VAT exemption for newly built residential properties (PPN DTP) until 2027 to preserve middle-class purchasing power and support the property sector, with the government covering the full VAT on new homes priced up to IDR 2 billion; for properties priced between IDR 2-5 billion, the exemption applies only to the first IDR 2 billion. (2) No increase in excise tax or retail price (HJE) of cigarettes to keep prices stable and protect industry margins. In addition, Purbaya said the government is opening the possibility to lower the standard VAT rate in 2026. Currently the effective VAT rate for most goods and services is 11%. Purbaya added that the discussion is not final, but a reduction could be implemented if the economy and state revenue are in good condition. Previously, Purbaya projected that Indonesia’s economy would further accelerate next year, with growth potentially reaching +6% year-on-year in the second half of 2026. Key Takeaway: Although Purbaya’s accelerated growth projection for 4Q25 was announced last week, it has not yet succeeded in attracting foreign investors back to the Indonesian stock market. In the past week, foreign investors recorded a net outflow of IDR 4.1 trillion from the regular market of the IDX Composite (IHSG). We assess that clear signs of economic acceleration are needed before the foreign outflow trend can reverse.",

      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto officially issued Presidential Regulation No. 109/2025 on waste-to-energy (PSEL) on 10 October 2025. The regulation designates Danantara as the entity responsible for selecting waste-to-energy service providers and implementing investments, while PT PLN is tasked with purchasing the electricity generated. The electricity purchase price is set at US$0.20 per kWh for all capacities, subject to ministerial review under certain conditions, and the power purchase agreement term is 30 years from commercial operation. Danantara CIO Pandu Sjahrir told Bloomberg that about 120 companies are likely to participate in the waste-to-energy project bidding, and Danantara aims to develop 33 waste-to-energy projects in Indonesia, with the bidding process expected to be completed within 6-8 weeks. Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani said on Tuesday (14/10) that the company expects annual dividends from state-owned enterprises to rise from US$7 billion in 2025 to US$10 billion within five years, allowing Danantara to invest up to US$40 billion of equity. Using debt, total investment capacity could reach US$250 billion over the same period. Spot gold prices surged +1.82% to US$4,218 per troy ounce on Wednesday (15/10) before easing to US$4,201 (+1.41%). The rise was driven by higher safe-haven demand amid expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and worsening US-China trade relations. Senior Director Sunata Tjiterosampurno told Bloomberg that Danantara is reviewing more than 50 investment agreements, including waste-to-energy projects in 20 cities, which will be evaluated by strategic partners this month. Previously, Danantara CIO Pandu Sjahrir told Reuters that the firm would invest US$10 billion (approximately IDR 165 trillion) in the first three months of operations starting October 2025. The International Monetary Fund, in its October 2025 World Economic Outlook, raised Indonesia’s 2025 and 2026 growth forecasts to +4.9% year-on-year, up from +4.8% in the July outlook. The IMF also lifted the global 2025 growth forecast to +3.2% year-on-year (from +3.0% in July), while the 2026 global forecast remains at +3.1%. Aliyahdin Saugi, CEO of Allianz Global Investors Indonesia, told Bloomberg that the Financial Services Authority (OJK) has approved a proposal from the Indonesian Investment Managers Association to increase foreign investment limits for mutual funds. Currently, mutual funds may hold up to 15% of net asset value abroad; the proposal seeks to raise the limit to at least 51% for equity-focused funds and 80% or higher for other funds. OJK has not yet commented. Indonesia has officially reopened its carbon credit market to foreign buyers through Presidential Regulation No. 110/2025, ending previous uncertainty that hindered the carbon market. Bloomberg reported that the new rules allow carbon credits from Indonesian emission-reduction projects to be sold to international voluntary buyers. Previously, Indonesia had halted new carbon credit sales to foreign buyers while reviewing the role of carbon sequestration in meeting national climate targets.",

INTP’s market share fell to 29.3% during 9M25 (down from 29.7% in 9M24).
