      "content": "The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its policy interest rate target in the range of 5.25% to 5.5% during its meeting on Wednesday (May 1), in line with consensus expectations. In that meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the Fed will not raise rates further, but he also noted that higher-than-expected inflation data for the first three months of 2024 could cause rate cuts to be slower than initially projected. On Thursday (May 2), probability analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool showed that the market expects the Fed’s first rate cut to start in September 2024, with a probability of 56.4%, down from 58% on April 25, 2024. The narrative of a higher-for-longer US rate environment triggered foreign outflows from Indonesian equities and bonds. In the past month, the IDX index recorded foreign outflows of IDR 20.31 trillion as of April 30, 2024. As of April 29, 2024, the Indonesian bond market saw foreign outflows of IDR 16.73 trillion over the past month. In addition to rate policy, the Fed also announced that it will reduce the pace of its balance-sheet runoff to US$25 billion per month starting June 1, 2024, down from the previous US$60 billion. Mortgage-backed securities issuance will remain permitted at a cap of US$35 billion per month. This step aims to ensure the financial system retains sufficient reserves, avoiding a shortage similar to that experienced in 2019 during the last round of quantitative tightening by the Fed.",

      "content": "The Fed’s signal to postpone US rate cuts may keep expectations for higher-for-longer Bank Indonesia rates. Previously, in the April 2024 Governor’s Board meeting, Bank Indonesia raised the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 6.25% to curb rupiah depreciation against the US dollar. In response to the stronger higher-for-longer signal, the yield on the 10-year Indonesian government bond rose by 10 basis points to 7.278% on Thursday (May 2). Over the past month, the yield has increased by 63 basis points. Persistently high rates for an extended period could pressure several sectors, including: Property and automotive – weaker demand due to higher mortgage (KPR) and motor vehicle loan (KKB) rates; Construction – high debt levels increase interest-bearing costs; Banking – higher cost of funds amid slowing DPK growth. Most banks reported higher cost of funds in 1Q24, squeezing net interest margins, consistent with industry data from OJK.",
