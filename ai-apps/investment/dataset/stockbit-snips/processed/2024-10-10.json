      "title": "AMMN: Capex up to US$200 Million per Year for Batu Hijau Mine",
      "content": "Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations of Amman Mineral Internasional, Kartika Octaviana, said the company will allocate routine capital expenditure of about 150-200 million US dollars per year for the next five years to open Phase 8 pit at the Batu Hijau mine owned by the company. Phase 8 mining at Batu Hijau is targeted to start production in 2025-2030, extending the mine life after Phase 7 ends production at the end of 2024. According to the 2023 JORC report, Phase 8 has total reserves of 3.86 billion pounds of copper and 5.3 million ounces of gold. Previously, Bloomberg reported in July 2024 that AMMN was seeking a loan of up to 1.5 billion US dollars to expand the Batu Hijau mine.\n\nCikarang Listrindo (POWR) plans to issue a bond of up to 500 million US dollars with a maximum fixed interest rate of 7 percent per year and a maturity no later than ten years. The corporate action is intended to increase liquidity, support general financing needs, and refinance bonds that will mature in 2026. The plan will be discussed at the extraordinary shareholders meeting on 22 November 2024.\n\nRaja (RAJA) Director General Rukun Raharja, Djauhar Maulidi, said the Tanjung Batu‑Samarinda fuel pipeline project will generate revenue of 225 billion rupiah per year, with an EBITDA contribution of 200 billion rupiah per year. The project will be executed by a consortium led by RAJA's subsidiary PT Petrotech Penta Nusa, which will invest approximately 982.5 billion rupiah in proportion to its participation. Construction will last two years, followed by ten years of operation and maintenance from the commercial start date.\n\nSummarecon Agung (SMRA) announced an additional capital contribution of 485 billion rupiah to its subsidiary PT Summarecon Property Development, raising the paid‑in capital of the parent from 4.56 trillion rupiah to 5.05 trillion rupiah. SMRA holds 99.99 percent of PT Summarecon Property Development. In addition to the additional paid‑in capital, the subsidiary also increased its authorized capital from 6 trillion rupiah to 7 trillion rupiah.\n\nLippo Cikarang (LPCK) plans to conduct a rights issue of up to 3 billion new shares, resulting in a dilution of up to 52.82 percent. The issue price and ratio have not been announced; the proceeds will be used for working capital and/or equity participation in subsidiaries. The plan will be discussed at the extraordinary shareholders meeting on 15 November 2024.\n\nVictoria Care Indonesia (VICI) will distribute an interim dividend for fiscal year 2024 of 23.48 billion rupiah, or 35 rupiah per share. The dividend will be recorded in the regular and negotiated markets on 17 October 2024, with payment on 8 November 2024. Based on VICI's share price of 640 rupiah on Thursday 10 October, the implied dividend yield is 5.46 percent.\n\nBlibli (BELI) CEO Kusumo Martanto said the fintech business is an important catalyst and a driver of the company's main business growth. He added that the company will continue to develop its fintech segment, although he did not elaborate on specific initiatives. BELI holds a 25 percent stake in fintech company Cermati Group and has a strategic partnership with Blu or BCA Digital.\n\nPresident‑elect Prabowo Subianto is optimistic that Indonesia's economic growth can reach plus 9 percent, higher than his target of plus 8 percent. Prabowo acknowledged that his growth target is often ridiculed, but he set an ambitious goal so that actual performance will not be far off if the target is not achieved. According to Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani, investment and exports will be the pillars for Indonesia to achieve an eight percent growth.\n\nCommunications and Information Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said his ministry has blocked access to the Chinese e‑commerce platform Temu in Indonesia and has sent an official letter to Google and Apple to remove the app from the Indonesian market, because Temu is not registered as an electronic system provider in Indonesia. He warned that Temu's business model could destroy local MSMEs by selling goods directly from factories to consumers, harming domestic products and labor.\n\nPublic Works and Housing Minister and IKN Authority Head Basuki Hadimuljono said sixteen coal entrepreneurs will invest in the new capital city (IKN), focusing on retail and entertainment sectors such as cinema construction. Previously, President Joko Widodo received several mining companies that intend to invest in IKN during an internal meeting at the presidential palace. Representatives included ADRO CEO Garibaldi Thohir, BUMI CEO Adika Nuraga Bakrie, INDY Vice President Aziz Armand, and APBI Chairman Adri Martowardojo.\n\nEnergy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said his ministry will revoke the operating licenses of idle oil and gas wells. He noted that 5,000 of the 16,000 idle wells have significant reserve potential, most of which are held by state‑owned enterprises and Pertamina. The revoked licenses will be offered to other companies to increase national oil and gas lifting.\n\nForeign investors recorded net outflows from Asian equity markets excluding China in October 2024, driven by profit‑taking amid concerns over valuations and Middle‑East tensions. According to LSEG data, foreign investors have sold a net total of 7.61 billion US dollars in India, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines since the start of October 2024. In September 2024, foreign investors had a net purchase of 759 million US dollars, supported by optimism over aggressive Fed rate cuts.\n\nState‑Owned Enterprises Vice Minister Kartika Wirjoatmodjo said the IPOs for PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) and MIND ID will be carried out in 2026‑2027 after new investors are secured for the Kuala Tanjung smelter expansion project in North Sumatra. He added that two strategic investors have been shortlisted for Inalum's smelter project, and that the final investment decision documents for the second phase of the alumina refinery (SGAR) in Mempawah, West Kalimantan, are targeted to be completed by the end of 2024.\n\nThe People's Bank of China (PBoC) launched a swap facility of 500 billion yuan (approximately 70.6 billion US dollars) to provide liquidity for institutional investors to buy stocks. The facility, effective on Thursday 10 October, is part of a stimulus package announced by Governor Pan Gongsheng at the end of September 2024.\n\nIndustry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said the iPhone 16 cannot be sold officially in Indonesia because the Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certificate for Apple has expired. The extension process is awaiting Apple to meet its investment commitments. Previously, Apple pledged 1.71 trillion rupiah in Indonesia, of which only 1.48 trillion rupiah has been realized so far.",
