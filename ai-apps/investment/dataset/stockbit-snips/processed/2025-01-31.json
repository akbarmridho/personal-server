      "title": "Foreign Inflow, Big Banks Lead Rebound IHSG",
      "content": "The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rose 0.5% to 7,109.20 on Friday, 31 January 2025, led by gains in BBCA (+3.3%) and BBRI (+2.4%) as foreign inflows entered the market. Net foreign inflow recorded at 297 billion rupiah for the day. Year-to-date, the index still shows a net foreign outflow of 3.7 trillion rupiah. Today's foreign inflow consisted of 268 billion rupiah in the regular market and 29 billion rupiah in the cash and negotiation market. The largest net foreign inflow in the regular market was contributed by BBRI (271 billion rupiah), BBCA (162 billion rupiah) and BBNI (44 billion rupiah). Bank Mandiri (BMRI) was the only big bank that recorded a net foreign outflow of 112 billion rupiah. \nKey Takeaway: We assess today's foreign inflow into big banks as an indication that the Indonesian market is becoming more attractive to foreign investors as US Treasury yields decline. If there is no escalation in US trade-policy tariffs that could affect US inflation and interest-rate outlook, we see further upside potential for big-bank stocks given their attractive valuations. The 1-year forward price-to-book ratios for big banks on Friday, 31 January were: BBRI 1.89× (approximately one standard deviation below the 10-year historical average); BMRI 1.79× (about 0.5 standard deviation above the 10-year average); BBNI 1.02× (about 0.5 standard deviation below the 10-year average); BBCA 3.99× (about 0.5 standard deviation above the 10-year average).",
