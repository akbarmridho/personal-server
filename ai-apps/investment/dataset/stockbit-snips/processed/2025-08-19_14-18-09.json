      "content": "1. Economists consensus surveyed by Reuters estimates that Bank Indonesia will maintain the BI Rate at 5.25% in the Board of Governors Meeting tomorrow, Wednesday (20/8). 2. The Director General at the Ministry of Finance, Febrio Nathan Kacaribu, stated on Friday (15/8) that there will be no change in the Value Added Tax (PPN) tariff policy in 2026. The Ministry of Finance confirmed that the 12% VAT rate will remain applicable to luxury goods, while the rate for general goods or non-luxury goods remains 11%. In the 2026 State Budget Draft itself, the government targets tax revenue to grow +13% YoY compared to the 2025 State Budget outlook. This target is based on the implementation of tax reform and the projection of solid domestic consumption levels. 3. Bloomberg reported that a number of analysts assessed that Indonesia risks exceeding the 2026 State Budget Draft deficit target of 2.48% of GDP due to the absence of plans for new taxation measures amid President Prabowo Subianto's populist programs. The government targeted state revenue of 3,148 trillion rupiah in the 2026 State Budget Draft, jumping +10% YoY from the 2025 State Budget outlook, supported by a +13% YoY increase in tax revenue targets. According to Fitch Solutions' research unit, BMI, this state revenue target appears too optimistic, considering the lack of new taxation measures, which will likely result in the government exceeding the fiscal deficit target in 2026. Meanwhile, Maybank maintained its projection for Indonesia's fiscal deficit in 2026 at 2.9% of GDP, based on a more moderate projection for state revenue growth of +7% YoY, approaching nominal GDP growth. 4. The General Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramics Association, Edy Suyanto, stated that the ceramics industry in West Java experienced a reduction in the allocation of Specific Natural Gas Price (HGBT) from 60% to 48% following restrictions imposed by Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS). Edy mentioned that these restrictions will apply from August 13-31, 2025, with usage above the quota being subject to a surcharge of 14.8 US Dollars per MMBtu.",

During 7M25, net profit growth was driven by solid PPOP growth of +12% YoY, although provision expense rose +65% YoY.
