      "title": "The Fed Cuts Interest Rate by 25 Bps, Projects Two More Cuts by End of 2025",
      "content": "The US central bank, the Federal Reserve, on Wednesday (September 17) local time decided to cut the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.00%-4.25%, in line with consensus expectations and marking the first rate cut of the year. In the post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the move was taken because the latest data showed increasing signs of weakness in the US labor market. Powell also emphasized that the decision was not without risk, noting that US inflation remained high even as the labor market softened. In addition to the rate cut, the Fed updated its economic projections for 2025 and 2026. The new projections show the policy rate expected to fall to a range of 3.5%-3.75% in 2025, compared with the June 2025 projection of 3.75%-4.0%. For 2026, the Fed projects an additional 25-basis-point cut, the same as the June 2025 outlook. The Fed raised its forecast for US real GDP growth to +1.6% in 2025, +1.8% in 2026 and +1.9% in 2027, versus the June 2025 forecasts of +1.4%, +1.6% and +1.8% respectively. Core inflation is projected at 3.1% in 2025 (unchanged from June), declining to 2.6% in 2026 (higher than the June 2025 estimate of 2.4%) and reaching 2.1% in 2027. Unemployment is expected to stay at 4.5% in 2025, then fall to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% in 2027. US financial markets reacted in a muted and mixed manner. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57% on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell 0.10% and 0.32% respectively. The US dollar index (DXY) gained 0.25% to around 96.9, and the 10-year Treasury yield rose 5.9 basis points to 4.087%. CIO SieberNXT Mark Malek told Reuters that the market reaction reflected profit-taking (sell-on-news) after the Fed’s rate-cut announcement. In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) weakened 0.21% on Thursday (September 18) after reaching an all-time high of 8,025 on Wednesday, following an unexpected rate cut by Bank Indonesia. The 10-year Indonesian government bond yield was flat at 6.28%, and the rupiah depreciated 0.5% to 16,505 per US dollar.",
