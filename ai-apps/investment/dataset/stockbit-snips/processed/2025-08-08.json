This results in 7M25 wholesale sales of 435,293 units (down 10% YoY), representing 48-58% of the 2025 target of 750,000-900,000 units (vs 7M24: 56% realization 2024). AISI reported domestic motorcycle sales in July 2025 reached 587,048 units (down 2% YoY, up 15.3% MoM). 7M25 motorcycle sales total about 3.7 million units (down 2.1% YoY), equal to 55-58% of the 2025 target of 6.4-6.7 million units (vs 7M24: 60% realization 2024). Survey from the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association showed Shopee was the most accessed e-commerce platform in 2025 with a access share of 53.22%, up from 41.65% the previous year. TikTok Shop had 27.37% (vs 2024: 12.2%), Tokopedia 9.57% (vs 2024: 9.4%). Lazada’s share fell to 9.09% in 2025 (vs 2024: 17.54%), followed by Blibli (BELI) which fell to 0.29% (vs 2024: 0.36%). Bloomberg reported that Indonesia’s 10-year government bond yield fell by 3 basis points to 6.42% on Friday (8/8), the lowest since September 2023. The decline occurred amid rising expectations of a Fed rate cut in September 2025 and softer US dollar, as well as expectations of further BI rate cuts. Bloomberg noted foreign investors have bought $3.5 billion of Indonesian government bonds since the start of 2025, exceeding 2024 inflows. Bank Indonesia reported the Indonesian consumer confidence index rose to 118.1 in July 2025 (vs June 2025: 117.8, July 2024: 123.4). The increase was driven by rises in almost all sub-indices except current income index, which fell 2.4 points to 117.8, and business activity expectations index, which weakened 1.8 points to 127.5. The chairman of the Regional Real Estate Indonesia (REI) DKI Jakarta, Arvin F. Iskandar, said on Thursday (7/8) that the organization targets 50 developer members to go public via IPO. The plan aims to strengthen developers’ capital to support housing supply and the government’s 3-million-house program. REI DKI Jakarta will promote a Jakarta Property Index as a regional property sector performance indicator for domestic and foreign investors. REI also intends to facilitate about 10-20 developers per year to conduct IPOs or issue other property investment instruments. Currently only 1% of the 500 REI DPP members are listed.",
