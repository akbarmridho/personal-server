      "title": "DEWA 1H25 Earnings Call: Prospect of Operational Performance Improvement in 2H25",
      "content": "Darma Henwa (DEWA) management held a 1H25 earnings call on Wednesday (6/8) afternoon. Here are our key notes:\n\n2Q25 Operational Performance Declined Due to High Rainfall\nThe decline in DEWA's revenue by -3.8% QoQ in 2Q25 was caused by a decrease in total material moved due to higher rainfall. Operationally, DEWA in 2Q25 recorded overburden volume of 33.4 million bcm (-4% QoQ) and coal production of 4.2 million tons (-0% QoQ), resulting in total material moved declining by -4% QoQ to 36.6 million bcm.\n\n2H25 Guidance: EBITDA Margin Has Potential to Continue Growing Along with New Equipment Operation\nDEWA management stated that the second batch of heavy equipment is already in the mining area and is currently being assembled. A total of 3 sets of heavy equipment are expected to start operating in early September 2025, with the rest operating in October 2025. This has the potential to increase the company's EBITDA margin in the coming quarters.\nDEWA management expects internal overburden volume in 3Q25 to rise to 19.98 million bcm (+47.1% QoQ from the 2Q25 realization of 13.58 million bcm) and 23.54 million bcm in 4Q25 (+17.8% QoQ from the 3Q25 expectation). However, DEWA management also stated that they plan to carry out impairment on fixed assets and inventory in 3Q25.\n\nPlans to Write Off Accumulated Loss Deficit\nDEWA will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGMS) on September 10, 2025, to seek shareholder approval to write off the negative retained earnings balance. DEWA will adjust the retained earnings account with the foreign currency translation adjustment account.\n\nUpdate on Gayo Mineral Resources\nDEWA management announced that the company is prioritizing exploration on 2 out of 8 pits at Gayo Mineral Resources and plans to announce them gradually after JORC in 2027.\n\nKey Takeaway\nAlthough newly meeting 47% of Stockbit's 2025F estimate, we assess that DEWA is still able to achieve our EBITDA expectation of IDR 1.7 trillion along with: 1) the realization of the EBITDA margin in 2Q25 at 27.8% has exceeded our 2025F expectation of 27%, as well as the potential for EBITDA margin increase in 2H25 alongside the addition of heavy equipment capacity; and 2) revenue has the potential to improve in 2H25 in line with better weather projections. However, from the net profit aspect, we see DEWA is at risk of not reaching our 2025F estimate due to the impairment plan the company intends to execute.",

      "content": "1. The Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Rosan Roeslani, claimed that the US will provide a 0% tariff for copper products originating from Indonesia, although he did not elaborate further. President Trump himself last week did exclude several copper products - for example, refined copper products - from the 50% tariff for copper commodities. Besides copper, Rosan claimed that the government has requested the US to grant tariff reductions for several other commodities, including nickel.\n2. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (6/8) imposed an additional 25% tariff on goods originating from India, following India's continued purchase of Russian energy. This additional tariff means goods from India will be subject to a total tariff of 50% by the US. The additional tariff for India will take effect within 21 days from the date Trump's order was issued on Wednesday (6/8). Trump's move was taken after the US failed to reach an agreement with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.\n3. China Customs noted that China's exports in July 2025 grew by +7.2% YoY to US$321.8 billion (vs. June 2025: +5.85% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of +5.4% YoY and marking the highest export growth since April 2025. This result was driven by export growth to the European Union, Southeast Asia, Australia, Hong Kong, and other markets, which could offset the trend of double-digit export decline to the US for 4 consecutive months.\n4. Brazilian company Suzano SA on Wednesday (6/8) announced it will cut pulp production by 3.5% or approximately 450,000 tons in the next 12 months. This step was taken after negotiations with clients in China - its largest market - were hampered by uncertainty over tariffs from US President Donald Trump. Suzano CEO, Joao Alberto Abreu, stated that negotiations regarding pulp prices were hampered by political uncertainty, especially amid expectations of increased supply to China due to reduced supply to the US. Although pulp is excluded from the 50% tariff imposed by the US on goods from Brazil, Abreu mentioned that uncertainty still significantly affects trade.\n5. Bank Indonesia noted that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of July 2025 decreased to USD 152 billion (vs. June 2025: USD 152.6 billion). This development was influenced by government foreign debt payments and the stabilization policy for the Rupiah exchange rate. The position of foreign exchange reserves at the end of July 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.3 months of imports or 6.2 months of imports and government foreign debt payments.",
