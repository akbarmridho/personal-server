      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, Predicts Fed Funds Rate Down 50 Bps in 2024",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (21/8) decided to keep the benchmark BI Rate at 6.25%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5.5% and 7% respectively. The decision was in line with consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the decision aligns with the strategy to further strengthen the stabilization of the rupiah exchange rate in Q3 2024. He also noted that the central bank remains open to the possibility of cutting the BI Rate in Q4 2024. Perry said Bank Indonesia forecasts that the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve, will carry out two cuts to the Fed Funds Rate (FFR) totaling -50 basis points by the end of 2024. By comparison, the consensus of economists surveyed by Bloomberg expects the Fed to cut rates by -75 basis points by the end of 2024. As expectations of Fed cuts rise, Indonesia's bond and equity markets have seen inflows of IDR 23.7 trillion and IDR 6.6 trillion respectively since the beginning of August 2024. The return of foreign funds to the Indonesian capital market also pushed the rupiah against the U.S. dollar up 4.8% month-to-date to a level of 15,485 per 21 August 2024. Key Takeaway: The recent significant strengthening of the rupiah gives Bank Indonesia more room to start cutting rates, although it appears likely to wait for the Fed’s cuts first. As previously noted in Stockbit Commentary, the prospect of rate cuts and a stronger rupiah will provide positive sentiment for the property and consumer sectors. Several property and consumer stocks have rallied strongly over the past month, including $PWON (+11.9%), $SMRA (+14.29%), $ICBP (+6.02%) and $INDF (+9.05%).",
