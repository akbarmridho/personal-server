      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) recorded a net profit of IDR 5 trillion in 3Q25 (-11% YoY, +7% QoQ). This results in a 9M25 net profit of IDR 15.1 trillion (-7% YoY), equal to 73% of the 2025 consensus estimate. Although the 9M25 result is below the historical seasonal trend (vs. 9M24: 76% realization, 9M23: 75%), the 3Q25 net profit was impacted by management’s decision to bring forward some opex and provision expenses that will be booked in 4Q25. Consequently, the 9M25 net profit is considered in line with expectations. Non-Interest Income was a highlight in 3Q25, growing +12% YoY and +23% QoQ, driven by gains from government bonds and strong transaction banking activity. Despite receiving liquidity injection from the government, BBNI maintains its 2025 credit growth guidance at +8-10% YoY, with September 2025 already at +10% YoY (vs. June 2025: +7% YoY). BBNI has disbursed about 50% of the government liquidity injection as of September 2025. Segmentally, credit demand remains high in the corporate segment, while consumer demand shows no clear improvement. For 2026 guidance, management expects credit growth to be slightly higher than 2025. Margin-wise, loan yield is expected to decline from 4Q25 and 2026F as interest rates fall and liquidity eases. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) guidance for 2025 is revised down from ≥3.8% to ~3.7%, indicating loan-yield pressure may outweigh the benefit of lower Cost of Funds (CoF). CoF MTD fell to 2.8% in September 2025 from 3.1% in August 2025 due to increased liquidity reducing the special rate. Asset quality improved, with Special Mention Loans and Loan-at-Risk decreasing quarterly, while Non-Performing Loans remained stable. Key Takeaway: BBNI’s performance may accelerate in 4Q25, reflected in management’s outlook. The stock has risen +14% since the Tactical Rotation commentary, trading at 0.92× 1-Year Forward P/BV, about 0.5 standard deviations below the 5-year historical average. With attractive valuation and dividend, we maintain a positive view on the banking sector, including BBNI.",

Provision expenses rose 230% YoY to improve the NPL Coverage Ratio to a target range of 115-120% (vs. 9M25: 110.5%). While credit growth guidance for 2025 remains at +7-9% YoY, management indicated a conservative outlook for potentially higher credit growth in 2026 at +10-11% YoY.
