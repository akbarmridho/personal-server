      "title": "Government Plans to Amend Minerba Royalty Rates",
      "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) held a public consultation on Saturday, 8 March, regarding the draft amendment to the mineral and coal (minerba) royalty regulations. In the draft, the government will increase royalty rates for several mineral commodities such as nickel, copper and gold. For coal, the government plans to adjust the royalty and non‑tax state revenue (PNBP) as follows:\n\n- IUP contracts: royalty rate rises by 1 percentage point for coal with calorific value ≤4,200 kcal/kg and >4,200‑5,200 kcal/kg when the Coal Reference Price (HBA) is ≥ US$90 per ton, becoming 9% and 11.5% respectively.\n- PKP2B contracts: royalty rate rises by 1 percentage point for the same calorific ranges when HBA ≥ US$90/ton, becoming 9% and 11.5%. In addition, the Mining Revenue (PHT) for the same calorific ranges falls by 1 percentage point, becoming 4.5% and 2%.\n- IUPK contracts (extension of PKP2B): the royalty range is changed. The government also plans to adjust the corporate income tax (PPh) for companies with IUPK contracts from 22% to the rate applicable under income tax regulations.\n\nKey Takeaway: If enacted, the proposal could pressure the performance of coal producers operating under IUP licences such as Bukit Asam (PTBA) and PKP2B operators such as Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITMG). The increase in metal royalties could also pressure mineral producers such as Vale Indonesia (INCO), Trimegah Bangun Persada (NCKL), Aneka Tambang (ANTM), Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS) and Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN).\n\nAccording to the adjustment plan, the commodities that will see the highest royalty increase are copper concentrate and ferronickel. With the copper reference price at US$9,362 per ton in March 2025, copper concentrate royalty could rise three‑fold from 5% to 15%, while ferronickel royalty could rise +150% from 2% to 5%.\n\nFor coal producers with IUPK contracts, the adjustment of the PNBP range could improve the performance of related issuers, given the HBA in March 2025 of US$128 per ton. Coal producers operating with IUPK contracts are Bumi Resources (BUMI), Indika Energy (INDY) and Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI).",
