In line with Yellen, IMF Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, mentioned that China's fiscal stimulus has been lacking in detail so far, so the IMF did not include this stimulus in its latest outlook.

      "content": "Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) recorded a significant net profit decline to 543 billion rupiah (-62% YoY, -47% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to only 3 trillion rupiah (-28% YoY), below expectations as it was equivalent to only 65% of the consensus FY24 estimate. The low net profit in 3Q24 was caused by declining revenue and weak margins. Revenue Fell Pressed by Volume Weakness - UNVR's revenue in 3Q24 only reached 8.4 trillion rupiah (-18% YoY, -7% QoQ), mainly pressured by a significant volume decline with domestic sales volume dropping -16% YoY. This resulted in revenue for 9M24 falling -10% YoY to 27.4 trillion rupiah. In the earnings call, UNVR management attributed the revenue decline to 3 factors: 1) inventory reduction across major channels; 2) disruption of distributor sales due to pricing instability and disharmony among various channels; and 3) the ongoing impact of boycotts. Operating Profit Margin Plummets - Pressure on net profit also came from the cost side, with the operating profit margin sharply declining to 8.7% in 3Q24 (vs. 3Q23: 17.9%, 2Q24: 14.6%). This decline was pressured by 3 factors: 1) decrease in economies of scale (diseconomies of scale) following the significant volume drop; 2) transformation and/or restructuring initiatives causing short-term production cost swelling; and 3) operating expense (opex) reduction not commensurate with the revenue decline due to relatively high advertising, research, and promotion costs. In its guidance, UNVR management expects that various ongoing initiatives by the company - such as inventory adjustment, pricing harmonization, and transformation - will only start showing results in 2H25. Key Takeaway With these weak results, we expect consensus estimates for UNVR's performance to be revised down again. In the last 3 months, the FY24 net profit estimate has been lowered by -9%. Meanwhile, UNVR's weak sales performance could be a positive indication for its competitors' sales, such as Tempo Scan Pacific (TSPC). UNVR management itself stated that the company's market share trend decreased in 3Q24 to 34.9% by value (vs. 10M23: 38.5%, 2Q24: 35.5%) and 28.4% by volume (vs. 10M23: 31.7%, 2Q24: 29%).
