      "title": "Kinerja Grup Merdeka 2Q25: MDKA Tertekan, MBMA Menguat",
      "content": "Merdeka Group reported its 2Q25 performance where Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA) and Merdeka Battery Materials (MBMA) showed contrasting results. MDKA recorded a net loss of US$12 million in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: loss of US$4 million, 2Q24: profit of US$3 million). This resulted in a 1H25 net loss of US$16 million (vs. 1H24: loss of US$13 million), below the consensus expectation of a US$3 million net profit for 2025F. In contrast, MBMA posted a net profit of US$9 million in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: loss of US$3 million, 2Q24: profit of US$17 million). This brought MBMA’s 1H25 net profit to US$6 million (-71% YoY), below consensus as it equals 23% of the 2025F consensus net profit estimate.\n\nMDKA: Pressured by Declining Gold & Copper Sales\n\nGold (Weak) – Although the average gold selling price rose sharply to US$3,207 per troy ounce (+16% QoQ, +42% YoY), gold sales volume fell to 22,739 oz (-38% QoQ, -9% YoY). This may be due to massive early-quarter sales in 1Q25 where MDKA sold 36,796 oz of gold despite producing only 25,481 oz. Production volume rose +2% YoY to 50,624 t during 1H25, representing 46-51% of the company’s guidance, with cash cost stable at US$1.125 per troy ounce, within the guidance range of US$1.100-1.250 per troy ounce.\n\nCopper (Weak) – Copper sales volume fell -41% QoQ to 1,742 t, in line with the shutdown of mining activities at the Wetar mine expected to last through 3Q25. Nevertheless, copper production will continue from processing of remaining stockpiles, with leaching and copper recovery expected to continue until 1Q27. Production volume fell -37% YoY to 4,235 t during 1H25, representing 35-42% of guidance, with cash cost up +13% YoY to US$3.0/lb, within the guidance range of US$3.0-3.2/lb.\n\nMBMA: Better NPI & Limonite Margins\n\nLimonite Ore (Improving) – MBMA’s limonite sales rose to 2.8 million wmt (+33% QoQ, -3% YoY) in 2Q25, driven by higher demand from affiliated HPAL facilities. Cash cost fell sharply from ~US$13 per wmt to US$11 per wmt, thanks to a logistics change from dump-truck hauling to slurry pipe. Production volume rose +43% YoY to 4.3 million t during 1H25, representing 29-34% of guidance.\n\nNPI (Improving) – MBMA cut NPI cash cost to US$9,719 per ton (-3% QoQ, -6% YoY), below the company’s guidance of US$11,000 per ton, while the average selling price remained stable at US$11,500 per ton (-1% QoQ, -0% YoY). Production volume fell -23% YoY to 33,045 t during 1H25, representing 41-47% of the new guidance of 70-80 k t versus the previous 80-87 k t.\n\nNickel Matte (Neutral) – Nickel matte production has been halted since 1Q25 due to thin margins. Production could resume as early as 4Q25 if price conditions improve.\n\nKey Takeaway – Following the 2Q25 earnings release, MBMA closed up +25% (auto-reject/ARA), while MDKA rose +7.25% on Friday (26/9). Among the Group’s projects, MBMA’s near-term outlook appears stronger, whereas MDKA’s outlook is more medium-term. MBMA’s NPI segment is expected to keep cash cost below US$10,000 per ton, preserving profitability, and limonite sales may rise with the operation of affiliated HPAL facilities. Additionally, the AIM project commissioning is progressing well with full-scale production expected in 2026.\n\nOn the other hand, MDKA’s Tujuh Bukit gold production is projected to meet guidance (100-110 k oz) with a more even quarterly sales distribution in 2H25. The Merdeka Gold Resources (EMAS) project is expected to start first-quarter 2026 gold output. For copper, Wetar’s contribution will further decline, and the Tujuh Bukit exploration project still lacks a production schedule.",

      "content": "Bank BTPN Syariah recorded a net profit of IDR 112 billion in August 2025 (+5% MoM, +45% YoY). This resulted in an 8M25 net profit of IDR 861 billion (+24% YoY), equal to 68% of the 2025F consensus consolidated estimate (vs. 8M24: 65% of 2024 consolidated net profit). The 8M25 profit was supported by a 44% YoY decline in provision expenses, although PPOP fell -12% YoY due to weaker Net Margin Income (NMI) (-4% YoY) and a 5% YoY rise in opex. NMI weakness during 8M25 coincided with a 4% YoY contraction in financing (vs. 1H25: -3% YoY, 8M24: -13% YoY), while Net Yield slipped to 23% (vs. 8M24: 24%).\n\nInvestor Relations United Tractors (UNTR) said on Thursday (25/9) that the Doup project is expected to be operational in 2028 with a production level of 140,000-155,000 oz of gold per year. The company plans to build a processing plant and supporting infrastructure with a capacity of 3,000 t of ore per year.\n\nTotal Bangun Persada (TOTL) plans to expand its business activities into: 1) central telecommunications construction, 2) water resources infrastructure, 3) non-fisheries ports, 4) civil oil & gas, mining, geothermal, other civil works, sports facilities, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. The plan will be discussed at the RUPSLB on 3 November 2025.\n\nBarito Renewables Energy’s shareholder, Green Era Energy Pte. Ltd., sold approximately 84.6 million BREN shares on 22 September 2025 at an average price of IDR 8,247 per share. The transaction value was about IDR 698 billion and was carried out to increase the free-float. After the transaction, Green Era Energy’s ownership fell from ~21.99% to ~21.92%.\n\nPerusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) recorded gas sales of 830 billion tud during 8M25 (-2% YoY), about 4-13% below the 2025 target range of 873-958 billion tud. Gas transmission volume reached 1,627 MMSCFD during 8M25 (+8% YoY), 13% above the 2025 target of 1,435 MMSCFD. Upstream gas sales were 15,844 BOEPD during 8M25 (-21% YoY), 8% below the 2025 target of 17,227 BOEPD.",

      "content": "Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa announced on Friday (26/9) that the government will not raise the cigarette excise tax in 2026 after discussions with the cigarette manufacturers’ association, GAPPRI. He explained that he wanted to lower the rate, but producers asked it not be changed. He added that the main focus is to clean the illegal cigarette market, both foreign and domestic, by creating a dedicated system for the tobacco product industry (IHT).\n\nThe Institute of International Finance reported that global debt reached a new record high of US$337.7 trillion at the end of 2Q25, driven by looser global financial conditions, a weaker US dollar, and a more accommodative stance by major central banks. The countries with the largest dollar-denominated debt increases were China, France, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.\n\nU.S. economic growth in 2Q25 was revised up to an annualised 3.8% in the final report (vs. the 3.3% second-estimate), the strongest two-year gain. Strong consumer spending and business investment drove the growth, though momentum is moderating due to tariff effects and policy uncertainty.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday (25/9) that the United States will impose a 100% tariff on branded drugs, a 25% tariff on heavy-duty trucks, and a 30-50% tariff on cabinets and furniture. The announcement, made on Truth Social, did not detail whether the tariff will be added to the country-of-origin rate or if exemptions exist for nations with trade agreements. The new tariffs are slated to take effect on 1 October 2025.\n\nFuji Finance Indonesia (FUJI) shareholder Jhon Veter Firdaus bought approximately 6.3 million FUJI shares at an average price of IDR 790 per share on 24 September 2025. The transaction value was about IDR 5 billion. After the transaction, Jhon Veter Firdaus’s direct ownership rose from 12.23% to 12.72%.\n\nBank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) expects the effective date of the spin-off of its Sharia banking unit to be 15 December 2025. The plan will be discussed at the RUPSLB on 18 November 2025. The spin-off is driven by the Sharia unit’s assets reaching IDR 54 trillion in 2023, surpassing the IDR 50 trillion threshold that mandates a spin-off.",
