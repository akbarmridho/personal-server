      "title": "BI Rate Cut After Trump Lowers Indonesia Tariffs",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% on Wednesday, 16 July, with the deposit facility and lending facility also each reduced by 25 basis points to 4.5% and 6% respectively. Prior to the announcement, Bloomberg consensus expectations were split, with 55% expecting the BI Rate to remain unchanged and 45% expecting a 25-basis-point cut.\n\nGovernor Perry Warjiyo explained that the decision considered: 1) inflation and core inflation projections for the next two years that remain low below the midpoint of the target range ±2.5%; 2) stability of the rupiah exchange rate; and 3) the effort to support economic growth. Bank Indonesia maintains its economic growth target at 4.6-5.4% year-on-year for 2025, which had been downgraded twice earlier this year.\n\nBank Indonesia reported that bank credit growth slowed to +7.77% YoY in the first half of 2025 (versus +8.43% YoY in the first five months), marking the weakest growth since June 2023 and below the downgraded 2025 target range of +8-11% YoY. The result was pressured by banks’ preference to keep liquid funds in securities and a cautious stance in loan disbursement. Nevertheless, the Governor said the bank still keeps the 2025 credit-growth target at +8-11% YoY, driven by expectations of improvement in the second half of 2025 as a trade agreement with the United States materialises.\n\nPerry said that trade uncertainty is gradually easing as the United States reduced tariffs on Indonesian products from the previous 32% to 19%. He noted that a lower policy rate could boost credit growth, while the tariff agreement is expected to help businesses make forward-looking decisions.\n\nRegarding the newly announced tariff reduction, the Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, told Bloomberg that the government is preparing a joint statement with the United States that will detail additional information on the agreement. The key points of the trade deal, according to U.S. President Donald Trump, are:\n\n1. Indonesia will not impose import tariffs or non-tariff barriers on U.S. goods.\n2. Indonesia will agree to import energy from the United States worth USD 15 billion, U.S. agricultural products worth USD 4.5 billion, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The time frame for these imports has not been disclosed.\n3. Trump added that “if there is transshipment from a country with a higher tariff, that tariff will be added to the tariff paid by Indonesia.”\n\nKey Takeaway: In response to these two developments, the rupiah weakened 0.11% to 16,278 per dollar, while the 10-year government bond yield remained flat at 6.573% on Wednesday. The Jakarta Composite Index rose 0.7% to 7,192, driven mainly by large-cap stocks $DCII (+19.99%) and $DSSA (+3.86%). Big banks moved mixed with small gains or losses under 2%.",
