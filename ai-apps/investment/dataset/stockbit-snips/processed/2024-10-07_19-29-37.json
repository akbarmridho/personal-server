      "title": "US Labor Absorption Exceeds Expectations, Rupiah Under Pressure",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded nonfarm payroll growth of 254,000 in September 2024, higher than the 12-month average growth of 203,000. This realization significantly exceeded economists' expectations of 140,000 based on a Reuters survey and marked the strongest growth since March 2024. The NFP growth in September 2024 was driven by the food services and drinking places, health care and social assistance, and construction sectors. This achievement caused the unemployment rate for September 2024 to drop to 4.1%, lower than the Reuters survey and the August 2024 realization of 4.2%. Furthermore, BLS also revised upward NFP for July 2024 to 144,000 (+61.8%) and August 2024 to 159,000 (+12%), both increased by 72,000 from the previous report. In response to this data release, market expectations for the Fed's interest rate cut until the end of the year decreased from 75 bps (target rate: 4-4.25%) last week to 50 bps (target rate: 4.25-4.5%) as of Monday (7/10), based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. The US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by +0.52% to 102.5 and the 10-year US Treasury yield rose +20 bps to 4%. Meanwhile, the US stock market reacted positively with the S&P 500 closing up +0.9%, Dow Jones +0.76%, and Nasdaq +1.22% on Friday (4/10) local time as anxiety over a hard landing subsided. Key Takeaway: For Indonesia, this development provides negative sentiment towards the Rupiah exchange rate and government bonds. The Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened by -1.26% to 15,680 in today's trading (7/10), while the 10-year government bond yield rose +8 bps to 6.73%. The prospect of fewer interest rate cuts by the Fed potentially narrows the room for BI to cut rates further. Based on the Bloomberg consensus as of October 7, 2024, BI is still expected to cut interest rates by a minimum of 25 bps until the end of 2024 and a minimum of 2x25 bps in 2025.",
