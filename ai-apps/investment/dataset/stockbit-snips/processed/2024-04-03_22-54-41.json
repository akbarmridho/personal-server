      "title": "HRUM: Acquisition of HPAL Smelter; Taking Stakes in Nickel Subsidiary Entities",
      "content": "Harum Energy (HRUM) announced 3 corporate actions in close succession this week, each involving the takeover of shares in nickel companies through loan conversions. Here are the details:\n- Acquisition of 51% Share in PT Blue Sparking Energy (BSE) HRUM through its subsidiary, PT Tanito Harum Nickel (THN), acquired 1.04 million (51%) shares of BSE through a conversion scheme of part of a loan amounting to approximately US$206.2 million. Before this transaction, HRUM through THN did not have a stake in BSE. BSE itself is developing an HPAL project with a capacity of 67,000 tons of MHP nickel and 7,500 tons of MHP cobalt per year in the Weda Bay Industrial Park. The project is targeted to begin commercial operations in 2026.\n- Taking New Shares in PT Harum Nickel Perkasa (HNP) HRUM subscribed to 8.48 million new HNP shares through a loan conversion scheme amounting to approximately 8.5 trillion rupiah or US$540 million. After this transaction, HRUM's ownership in HNP increased from 99.95% to 99.99%. This transaction was carried out in order to improve HNP's capital structure, as well as the development and expansion of HRUM's business activities in the nickel industry.\n- Taking New Shares in PT Tanito Harum Nickel (THN) HRUM, HNP, and a third-party company named PT Mahkota Emas Nickel (MEN) subscribed to 12.47 million new THN shares through a loan conversion scheme amounting to approximately 12.5 trillion rupiah or US$794.2 million. After this transaction, HRUM's share ownership in THN decreased from 39.58% to 22.27%. Meanwhile, HNP's ownership increased from 60% to 77.52%. MEN's share ownership decreased from 0.42% to 0.21%.\nHNP and THN are HRUM's subsidiaries overseeing the nickel business. Since 2020, HRUM has conducted various acquisitions in the nickel sector through both companies. THN records holding 51% shares of PT Position and 99.99% shares of PT Infei Metal Industry. HNP holds 80.7% shares in PT Westrong Metal Industry.\nKey Takeaway\nWe assess that only the BSE transaction provides a direct positive impact on HRUM's fundamentals, considering BSE is a new nickel asset for the company. Meanwhile, we assess the THN and HNP transactions do not provide a significant impact because HRUM's effective ownership in both does not change much post-transaction. Since announcing the BSE transaction on Monday (4/1) evening, HRUM's stock price has strengthened by +8.5% in the last 2 days.\nThe value of the loan conversion of approximately US$206.2 million into a 51% stake in BSE indicates a valuation for BSE reaching US$404.2 million or 6.4 trillion rupiah. Previously, in early October 2023, HRUM through THN had signed a loan facility agreement with BSE amounting to US$500 million for the development of the HPAL facility. Of this amount, US$300 million has been disbursed on October 17, 2023. Nevertheless, there is no information regarding the detailed investment cost of BSE's HPAL construction.\nFor comparison, here is the investment value of HPAL projects currently being developed by several nickel issuers on the IDX:",
