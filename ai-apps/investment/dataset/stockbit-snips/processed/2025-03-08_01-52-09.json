      "title": "SIDO 2024: Net Profit +23% YoY, Slightly Above Expectations",
      "content": "Herbal and Pharmaceutical Industry Sido Muncul ($SIDO) [recorded](https://investor.sidomuncul.co.id/misc/fr/2024/FY-2024.pdf) a net profit of 393 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (+8% YoY, +132% QoQ). This result brings the net profit for 2024 to 1.17 trillion rupiah (+23% YoY), slightly above consensus expectations and relatively in line with our expectations as it is equivalent to 103/98% of consensus/Stockbit estimates. For your information, SIDO management targeted a minimum net profit growth of +10% YoY for 2024. The solid net profit growth throughout 2024 was driven by fairly good revenue growth as well as higher margins. Recovery in the 'Herbal' Segment Revenue from the companyâ€™s main segment, 'Herbal', returned to positive annual growth to 943 billion rupiah (+6% YoY, +118% QoQ), after experiencing a -4% YoY decline [in 3Q24](https://stockbit.com/post/16138829). This result caused SIDO's total revenue to grow +7% YoY in 4Q24 and +10% YoY throughout 2024, relatively in line with management's guidance targeting a minimum growth of +10% YoY throughout 2024. The positive revenue performance in 4Q24 also had a positive impact on SIDO's gross profit margin which rose to 62.9% (vs. 4Q23: 62.3%, 3Q24: 52.6%). Reinvestment in A&P SIDO appeared to reinvest 4Q24 gross profit (+8% YoY, +112% QoQ) into advertising and promotion (A&P), where this expense item increased to 188 billion rupiah (+17% YoY, +113% QoQ). The A&P ratio to revenue also rose from 10.9% in 2023 to 11.7% in 2024. This A&P reinvestment led to an increase in opex to 308 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (+26% YoY, +85% QoQ), thus making core operating profit in 4Q24 relatively flat at 505 billion rupiah (+0% YoY, +133% QoQ). Nevertheless, core operating profit throughout 2024 still grew solidly by +19% YoY to 1.47 trillion rupiah, with EBIT growing +24% YoY. Key Takeaway SIDO management targets revenue and net profit growth of +10% YoY each for 2025, higher than consensus expectations which project growth at +8% YoY. SIDO management will hold an earnings call for 2024 performance on Monday (10/3) afternoon.",
