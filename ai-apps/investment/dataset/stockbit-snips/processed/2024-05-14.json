      "content": "Senior Economist and Associate Faculty of the Indonesian Banking Development Institute, Ryan Kiryanto, projected that bank credit growth in 2024 will reach only 7‑10% year‑on‑year, lower than the industry target set by Bank Indonesia of 10‑12% year‑on‑year. He based his projection on the unfavourable global economic conditions, which will cause most banks to revise their targets downwards. Previously, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) revised its credit growth guidance from 11‑12% year‑on‑year to 10‑12% year‑on‑year, while Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) cut its guidance from 11‑12% year‑on‑year to 10‑11% year‑on‑year.",

      "title": "ASII: Down 10% on Ex‑Date; Opportunity to Earn Minimum 5% Dividend per Year",
      "content": "The share price of Astra International (ASII) fell 9.75% to 4,580 rupiah per share in today's trading on Tuesday (14/5), which is the ex‑dividend date. Previously, ASII distributed a final dividend for fiscal year 2023 amounting to approximately 17 trillion rupiah or 421 rupiah per share, with a payment date of 30 May 2024. This indicates a final dividend yield of 8.3% based on the cum‑dividend price of 5,075 rupiah per share on Monday (13/5). In addition to the final dividend, ASII previously paid an interim dividend of about 4 trillion rupiah or 98 rupiah per share in October 2023. In total, ASII paid a dividend of 519 rupiah per share from the 2023 net profit, equivalent to a 62% dividend payout ratio. The chart shows that ASII's dividend payout ratio was stable at 40% before the pandemic (2017‑2019), while the lowest post‑2020 ratio was 48%. Net profit levels after the pandemic (since 2022) are also higher than pre‑pandemic levels. With today's price decline, ASII shares have weakened 18.9% year‑to‑date, driven by negative sentiment such as BYD's entry and weak automotive sales. Key Takeaway: We consider bottoming signs in car sales are needed before price recovery, but the current price offers an opportunity to collect ASII as a high‑dividend, consistent payer. Based on a conservative dividend assumption of 239 rupiah per share (as in 2021), the dividend yield would be 5.2% at the current price of 4,580 rupiah per share.
