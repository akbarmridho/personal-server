      "title": "China Economy Exceeds Expectations, Imports of ATH Coal",
      "content": "China's National Bureau of Statistics recorded that China's economic growth in Q4 2024 reached +5.4% YoY (vs. Q3 2024: +4.6% YoY), exceeding consensus expectations at +5% YoY and marking the highest annual growth in the last 6 quarters. This result brought China's economic growth throughout 2024 to +5% YoY (vs. 2023: +5.2%), in line with the Chinese government's target and exceeding the World Bank's projection of +4.9% YoY. On a quarterly basis, China's economy in Q4 2024 grew +1.6% QoQ (vs. Q3 2024: +1.3% QoQ), aligning with consensus expectations. China's economic growth in Q4 2024 was driven by a series of stimulus measures from the country's government and central bank since September 2024 to support economic recovery. For 2025, the World Bank projects China's economic growth will slow to +4.5% YoY along with declining household and business confidence, headwinds in the property sector, and trade war risks. Although slower, this projection is still +0.4 percentage point higher compared to the World Bank's previous expectation. In December 2024, Reuters reported that the Chinese government plans to set an economic growth target of around +5% for 2025, with the budget deficit increasing from 3% to 4% of GDP. This Reuters report came a few days after leaders in China - including President Xi Jinping - concluded the annual economic conference in Beijing, where they are expected to have set targets that will be officially announced in the parliamentary session in March 2025. Bloomberg reported that both targets are largely in line with economists' expectations. Besides recording above-expectation economic growth, China also recorded its highest ever coal imports in 2024 amounting to 542.7 million tons (+14.4% YoY). This amount is equivalent to 41% of total global coal imports, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group. China's realized coal imports in 2024 were also more than double that of India - the second-largest coal importer in the world - which imported 250.2 million tons of coal last year. Based on BPS data, the volume of Indonesian coal exports to China during 2024 reached ~93.2 million tons (+14.1% YoY), although in value terms it decreased by -6% YoY to ~$6.6 billion USD. For 2025, the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association projects that China's coal imports will decrease by -3.26% YoY to 525 million tons as domestic production increases. The association estimates that China's coal production will grow by +1.5% YoY in 2025, while demand is projected to grow around +1% YoY. Key Takeaway: We assess that the outlook for China's coal demand will depend on the extent and effectiveness of the stimulus that the Chinese government will continue to disburse to boost growth in that country. The projection for China's coal demand and imports by the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association itself does not mention the level of stimulus assumptions used. Increased coal demand is crucial to offset the predicted increase in coal production in 2025, both from China itself and Indonesia. On the other hand, we note that the decline in ICI coal prices - which are more relevant to Indonesian producer issuers - is much shallower compared to the recent decline in Newcastle coal prices [see table]. This has the potential to provide support for the performance of these producers. Furthermore, domestically, the potential revision of coal royalties is also a factor that investors need to monitor.",
