      "title": "2024 Recap: Year of Rate Cuts and Elections",
      "content": "During 2024, expectations for interest rate cuts and its developments became the main focus for market participants and caused significant volatility in the market. At the end of 2023, The Fed predicted that they would cut US interest rates by 75 bps throughout 2024. However, contrary to expectations, The Fed in April 2024 signaled higher-for-longer and postponed the interest rate cut plan following slow disinflation process and solid US labor market conditions. The Fed's move also put pressure on the Rupiah exchange rate and prompted Bank Indonesia to unexpectedly raise the BI Rate by 25 bps in April 2024. Coupled with concerns about Indonesia's future fiscal prudence going forward, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened to near the 16,500 level in June 2024, marking the lowest level since April 2020. The situation reversed in 3Q24, where the rate cut cycle narrative strengthened again in July 2024 following weakening US employment data. In September 2024, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut interest rates by 25 bps to the 6% level following the strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar to the range of 15,000. In the same month, The Fed cut interest rates by 50 bps, followed by a 25 bps cut in November 2024. The Fed ended 2024 by cutting interest rates by 25 bps in December 2024, but projected fewer US interest rate cuts in 2025. This year was also a political year, with Indonesia and the US holding presidential elections. In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto's administration continues the plan to increase VAT to 12% starting in 2025 to finance fiscal needs, despite decreasing public purchasing power. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election raised risks of a weakening Chinese economy and potentially pushed US inflation forward due to the protectionist policies he envisioned. Here is a sequence of important events that occurred during 2024 in terms of macro-economy, industry, and politics: 1Q24 - The government continued rice social assistance (bansos) of 10 kg per month for 22 million recipients until June 2024 to anticipate the impact of El Nino. The government then extended this social assistance until December 2024. - The government released regulations for 100% government-borne VAT (PPN DTP) for house purchases from January 1-June 30, 2024, and 50% PPN DTP from July 1-December 31, 2024. - Prabowo Subianto-Gibran Rakabuming Raka won the Indonesian presidential election. Prabowo-Gibran targeted economic growth of +8%, food and energy self-sufficiency, and campaigned for free nutritious meal programs for schoolchildren and pregnant women. - Gold prices reached 2,195 US dollars per troy ounce on March 8, 2024 - which was an all-time high at the time - following market expectations that The Fed would begin interest rate cuts in 2H24. Gold prices continued to strengthen, reaching an all-time high of 2,790 US dollars per troy ounce on October 30, 2024. 2Q24 - Indonesian inflation in March 2024 reached 3.05% YoY, the highest in 7 months. This result was driven by inflation in food, beverages, and tobacco reaching 7.43% YoY - the highest since September 2022 - following the impact of El Nino. - Brent crude oil prices reached 92.14 US dollars per barrel on April 12, 2024, the highest level during 2024, following the escalation of the Israel-Iran conflict. - The Chinese government plans to issue 1 trillion yuan worth of bonds to stimulate its slowing economy. 3Q24 - Indonesia recorded monthly deflation for 5 consecutive months from May-September 2024. - The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued new regulations regarding the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) scheme for the upstream oil and gas (migas) industry, which potentially gives Contract Work Cooperation Contractors (KKKS) a larger share percentage. - The IHSG recorded an all-time high record at the 7,905 level on September 19, 2024, following the start of The Fed's interest rate cuts and dovish projections for 2025. - The government extended 100% PPN DTP for house purchases until December 31, 2024. - The government decided not to change the Tobacco Excise Duty (CHT) tariff for 2025 due to the downtrading phenomenon, but will increase the retail selling price (HJE). - China's central bank (PBoC) cut the medium-term lending facility (MLF) rate by 30 bps to the 2% level and announced several stimulus packages to support 2024 economic growth to reach the Chinese government target of +5% YoY. 4Q24 - Donald Trump won the US presidential election, pushing the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Index to all-time highs. Trump proposed import duties of 10-20% on all imported goods and 60% for Chinese products. - Indonesia recorded inflation of 1.71% YoY in October 2024, the lowest since 2021. - Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, released anti-dumping import duties (BMAD) on imported ceramic tile products from China. The regulation is valid for 5 years and will impose anti-dumping import duties with a tariff range of 13,446-94,544 Rupiah per square meter. - The US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened to the 106.9 level on November 14, 2024, marking the highest level in the last 1 year, after the Head of The Fed, Jerome Powell, stated that they would not rush to cut interest rates given the solid US economy. - OPEC+ again postponed oil production recovery for 3 months until April 2025 and extended the oil production recovery period from 12 months to 18 months. This decision marked the third postponement of oil production recovery by OPEC+ due to weak demand and production surges outside the group. - The government announced that the average wage increase for 2025 is +6.5%. - The government confirmed the VAT increase from 11% to 12% per January 1, 2025. - The government announced several incentives for 2025, including a 3% PPnBM DTP incentive for hybrid cars, an extension of VAT DTP for house purchases, food and electricity assistance, and support for labor-intensive sectors.",
