      "title": "ðŸ”± Trump Postpones Tariffs for 56 Countries, Tariffs for China Rise to 125%",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday, local time (April 9), a temporary suspension of the implementation of higher reciprocal tariffs for 56 countries for 90 days. Nevertheless, tariffs for China remain in effect and were raised from 104% to 125%, in response to China's retaliatory actions. Furthermore, Trump maintained the base reciprocal tariff of 10% for all imports to the US. Trump's decision to postpone tariffs came amidst financial market panic, and increasing pressure from business owners and investors to cancel the policy. Previously, Trump hinted on Tuesday (April 8) that the US was open to making a deal that could reduce or eliminate the higher reciprocal tariffs. On Wednesday (April 9), Trump added that countries not taking retaliatory measures would be given a reward. Trump's decision to maintain reciprocal tariffs for China occurred amidst the escalation of the trade war between the two countries. Previously, the Chinese government announced on Wednesday (April 9) an increase in tariffs on US imports from 34% to 84% effective April 10, 2025, and stated it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO). This decision followed the tariff increase imposed by the US on China, after China took retaliatory measures. On Thursday (April 10), Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that the US decision to start a trade war with China would end in failure. However, Lin added that the Chinese government hoped the US could resolve differences with China amicably through dialogue. To date, no retaliatory tariff increases have been announced by China after the US implemented the 125% tariff. Domestically, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said on Thursday (April 10) that the 32% tariff imposed by the US on Indonesia could cut Indonesia's potential economic growth by about 0.3-0.5 percentage points. On the other hand, Sri Mulyani welcomed the 90-day tariff postponement, mentioning that this period is an opportunity to negotiate solutions, reduce economic risks, and form mutually beneficial cooperation. Responding to Trump's tariff postponement announcement, the US stock market rebounded significantly on Wednesday (April 9) local time, with S&P500 +9.52% and Nasdaq +12.16%. This positive sentiment was followed by various stock markets in Asia on Thursday (April 10), with Nikkei +8.99%, SSE +1.16%, and HSI +2.06%. The IHSG closed up +4.79% on Thursday (April 10), with the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar strengthening +0.38% to 16,800, and the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield decreasing by about -9 bps to 7.048.",

      "content": "Although the 90-day pause may provide time for negotiation, we assess that the negotiation results and changes in attitude - from both the US and China - remain highly dynamic. Japan and South Korea are reported to be parties that have negotiated with the US - which can serve as an example of negotiations for other countries - so developments need to be monitored by investors. Investors need to remain vigilant and deal with good/bad news regarding trade war developments wisely, given the high uncertainty. Having a diversified portfolio across various asset classes can help minimize the impact of market volatility. Investors can consider short-term government bonds that have lower volatility - such as PBS003 and ST014-T2 - or money market funds.",
