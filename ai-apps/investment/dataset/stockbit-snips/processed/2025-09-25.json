      "title": "RI Signs Trade Agreements with the EU and Canada",
      "content": "Indonesia on Tuesday (23/9) signed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA), which will eliminate tariffs for 80% of Indonesian products exported to the EU, including palm oil, coffee, and textiles. In return, Indonesia will remove import duties on 98.5% of goods from the EU and simplify entry procedures for products such as automobiles and food items. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said the IEU-CEPA is targeted to become effective on 1 January 2027, and the government expects exports to the EU to double in the first five years of implementation. The existing nickel export ban, which is still under dispute at the WTO, will remain in force. The EU's anti-deforestation regulation, which Indonesia opposes, is not cancelled but its implementation has been postponed for one year until 30 December 2026. Although the IEU-CEPA is slated to start on 1 January 2027, the Chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, Eddy Martono, said the association forecasts Indonesian palm oil exports to the EU to rise to 4 million tonnes in 2026 from an estimated 3.3 million tonnes in 2025, a view supported by the postponement of the EU anti-deforestation regulation. On Wednesday (24/9) Indonesia also signed a trade agreement with Canada, granting better market access for 90% of Indonesian export products, including textiles, paper, processed foods, and palm oil. Canadian International Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu said the agreement is expected to provide duty-free access for up to 95% of Canadian export goods to Indonesia over the next 8-12 months and could double the bilateral trade value within six years. In 2024, total Indonesia-Canada trade amounted to USD 3.6 billion, while Indonesia-EU trade was USD 30.1 billion, according to Reuters. The agreements are part of Canada’s and the EU’s efforts to expand their reach in Asia. Reuters reported that Canada will soon sign a trade deal with the Philippines and is considering similar moves with Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea. Bloomberg noted that the EU is pursuing trade agreements with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Key Takeaway: As previously reported, sectorally the trade agreements are significant for Indonesia’s textile sector, which employs many workers. The potential increase in demand from the agreements and the delayed EU anti-deforestation regulation could also generate positive sentiment for the CPO sector.",

      "content": "Director of Godrej International Ltd., Dorab Mistry, estimates that CPO prices could rise about 15% and reach 5,000 ringgit per tonne by the end of 2025, potentially hitting 5,500 ringgit per tonne in Q1 2026, the highest level since June 2022. His projection is based on the end of the CPO production cycle, continued illegal palm-land take-overs by the Indonesian government, the upcoming B50 program, and high prices of substitute oilseed products. He also notes that the government’s effort to seize illegal palm land may lower CPO productivity, which has been stagnant or declining, and expects CPO supply to increase by only 1 million tonnes in 2025-2026, down from 1.5 million tonnes the previous year. Freeport-McMoRan announced a force majeure at its Grasberg mine in Central Papua on Wednesday (24/9). The company expects consolidated copper and gold sales for Q3 2025 to be lower by 4% and 6% respectively compared with prior estimates. Before the event, Grasberg contributed roughly 3.2% of global copper supply this year and accounted for about 30% of Freeport’s copper production and 70% of its gold output. Freeport indicated that a gradual recovery and ramp-up of operations at Grasberg could begin in the first half of 2026, but production at PT Freeport Indonesia in 2026 may be about 35% lower than previously forecast. SKK Migas reported that upstream oil and gas investment realization for the first eight months of 2025 reached approximately USD 9.4 billion (about IDR 153 trillion), 55% of the 2025 target of USD 16.5 billion. New exploration investment amounted to USD 500 million (about IDR 8.4 trillion), 33% of the 2025 target of USD 1.5 billion. New exploration well drilling reached 18 wells, 36.9% of the 2025 target of 46 wells, and the agency expects to achieve 43 wells (93.5% of the target). The Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) signed a memorandum of understanding for financing of CAD 825 million (about IDR 10 trillion) from Export Development Canada, to be used for private-sector projects in infrastructure, clean technology, renewable energy, agriculture, and food. BEI Director Jeffrey Hendrik announced on Wednesday (24/9) that the exchange will again postpone short-selling transactions for six months due to heightened global and domestic market volatility, following guidance from OJK. The postponement also aims to allow more market participants to engage in short-selling, as currently only two members have short-selling permission. Previously, short-selling was expected to resume on 29 September 2025 after being delayed since March 2025.",

The August 2025 profit decline was driven by a provision expense increase of +172% YoY, although PPOP still grew +10% YoY. Over the 8M25 period, PPOP fell -5% YoY due to higher OPEX (+2% YoY) and weaker Net Interest Income (-2% YoY), reflected in the Net Interest Margin (bank only) dropping to 3.6% (vs. 3.9% in 8M24 and 3.5% in 1H25). Provision expenses for the full 8M25 period decreased -7% YoY, so the profit decline was not as deep as the PPOP decline.",
