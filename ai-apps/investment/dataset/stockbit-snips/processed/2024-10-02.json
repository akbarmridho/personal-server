      "title": "Oil Prices Rise +2.65% Following Iran Attack on Israel",
      "content": "Crude oil Brent futures surged more than +5% on Wednesday (2/10) before closing up +2.65% at USD 75.5 per barrel, driven by market concerns over supply disruptions amid escalating geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. The concern arose after Iran launched its largest attack on Israel on Tuesday (1/10), in retaliation for Israel's strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon over the weekend. Following the Iranian attack, an anonymous Israeli official told Axios that Israel will launch a retaliatory strike likely targeting Iranian oil production facilities and other strategic locations. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in OPEC, with production of 3.7 million barrels per day in August 2024, about 4% of global output. Before the Wednesday surge, Brent futures had weakened to around USD 70 per barrel in September 2024 due to a weakening global economy and OPEC+ plans to reduce production cuts by December 2024. OPEC forecasts oil demand growth to fall from 2.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025. Key Takeaway: The rise in oil prices gave a positive sentiment to oil and oil-support stocks, with $MEDC (+8.95%), $ENRG (+7.21%), $WINS (+6.71%), $ELSA (+6.99%), and $LEAD (+6.38%) gaining on Wednesday (2/10). In the short term, oil prices will be influenced by geopolitical developments, especially if tensions intensify. In the longer term, oil price prospects will depend on how successful China's stimulus package is in reviving its economy and boosting oil demand versus potential additional supply from OPEC+ production increases.",

      "content": "ADRO: Adaro Energy Indonesia clarified to the IDX that the divestment of PT Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AAI), ADRO's thermal coal subsidiary, will not affect the company's ongoing operations. Management said the company will focus on non‑thermal coal and green businesses, and the AAI divestment can help secure broader financing and better partner access.

Assuming a closing price of IDR 110 per share on Wednesday (2/10), the implied dividend yield is 2.73%. The Institute for Supply Management reported the US Manufacturing PMI at 47.2 in September 2024, slightly below the 47.5 forecast, indicating six consecutive months of contraction. ISM Manufacturing Committee Chair Timothy Fiore said demand remains weak as US firms stay cautious amid tight monetary policy and election uncertainty. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported job openings rose by 329,000 to 8.04 million in August 2024, surpassing the consensus estimate of 7.66 million. Indonesian Minister of National Development Planning Suharso Monoarfa said his ministry has data showing some local governments manipulate inflation data to obtain central‑government incentives. He urged the Minister of Home Affairs Tito Karnavian to penalize officials who manipulate inflation data. According to Kontan, the Ministry of Finance has granted fiscal incentives totaling IDR 300 billion to 50 local governments that successfully control inflation. BUMN Minister Erick Thohir said the number of state‑owned enterprises will be reduced to 30 from the current 47, aligning with the incoming president Prabowo Subianto's direction. Wyloo Metals Pty Ltd, owned by Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest, signed a memorandum of understanding with Metalshub to explore a “green nickel” price index, aiming to set a global standard for low‑carbon nickel sales and provide buyers with origin and carbon‑footprint information. Forrest previously criticized some companies for using cheap Indonesian nickel with higher emissions. In early 2024, Wyloo announced a temporary shutdown of its Kambalda nickel mine in Western Australia by the end of May 2024 due to low nickel prices. Oracle announced on Wednesday (2/10) a plan to invest more than USD 6.5 billion to build its first public cloud region in Malaysia, joining other tech giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and ByteDance that have announced multi‑billion‑dollar digital investments in Malaysia, primarily in cloud and data‑center infrastructure to meet rising AI demand.",
