      "title": "BBRI: February-25 Performance Recovered, CEO Changed, and Final Dividend Rp208/Share",
      "content": "The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGMS) of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) on Monday (24/3) approved the proposal for changes in the board of directors and commissioners, with Hery Gunardi becoming the President Director of BBRI, replacing Sunarso who had served since 2019. Hery previously served as the President Director of Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS).\nFurthermore, BBRI shareholders also approved the distribution of the 2024 fiscal year dividend amounting to approximately 52 trillion rupiah, equivalent to an 86% dividend payout ratio (vs. 2023: 80%). This amount indicates a final dividend of 208.4 rupiah per share and a yield of 5.8%, based on BBRI's closing share price on Monday (24/3) at 3,610 rupiah per share. Previously, BBRI had distributed an interim dividend for the 2024 fiscal year of 135 rupiah per share in January 2025.\nLast weekend, BBRI announced (https://www.ir-bri.com/misc/QR/2025/BRI_Lapkeu_M02_2025_Eng.pdf) a net profit (bank only) of 4.6 trillion rupiah in February 2025 (+42% YoY, +129% MoM), a significant recovery from the low performance in January 2025. This result brought the bank only net profit for 2M25 to 6.6 trillion rupiah (-18% YoY), below the consensus consolidated growth estimate for 2025F at -1.3% YoY following the effect of management overlay (https://stockbit.com/post/17707020) in January 2025.\nThe normalization of credit cost (CoC) became the main driver for the recovery of bank only net profit in February 2025, in line with the management guidance (https://stockbit.com/post/17714295) provided after the release of bank only performance for January 2025. Besides CoC normalization, the recovery of Net Interest Margin (NIM) was also a positive aspect we highlighted. Meanwhile, the surge in opex became a concern for us.\n- CoC Normalized after Surge in January 2025: BBRI recorded a bank only CoC at the level of 3.28% in February 2025 (vs. January 2025: 5.57%, February 2024: 6.72%) following provisioning expenses which began to normalize to 3.3 trillion rupiah (-49% YoY, -41% MoM). This result brought the CoC for 2M25 to 4.42% (vs. 2M24: 4.38%), still above management's consolidated FY25 guidance which targets a range of 3-3.2%. The normalization of CoC is a good early indication that front-loading provisions have been overcome. Asset quality developments will remain our focus, including in the 1Q25 earnings call discussion.\n- NIM Recovered: Bank only NIM increased to 6.39% in February 2025 (vs. February 2024: 6.17%, January 2025: 6.15%) following relatively good Net Interest Income (NII) realization at 9.3 trillion rupiah (+3% YoY, +4.7% MoM). This good NII was also driven by a significant drop in interest expense to 3.9 trillion rupiah (-8.7% YoY, -4.8% MoM) along with a decrease in time deposits of -9.8% YoY. For 2M25, NIM was at 6.25% (vs. 2M24: 6.4%), still below management's consolidated FY25 guidance targeting a range of 7.3-7.7%. In the January 2025 performance earnings call, BBRI management expected loan growth and liquidity conditions to start improving in 2Q25, which could positively impact NIM.\n- Opex Surge: Opex increased to 4.3 trillion rupiah (+111% YoY, -9.6% MoM) in February 2025, causing 2M25 opex to surge to 9.1 trillion rupiah (+37% YoY). This opex surge was mainly driven by an increase in labor costs to 4.2 trillion rupiah during 2M25 (+20% YoY). This cost increase was primarily due to the difference in timing related to the booking of holiday allowance (THR) expenses. A more apple-to-apple opex comparison compared to last year will be visible in the performance realization during 1Q25.",
