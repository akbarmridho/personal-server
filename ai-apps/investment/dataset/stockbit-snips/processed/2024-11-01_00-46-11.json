      "title": "INDF: Net Profit Driven by Exchange Gains, Operations Remain Solid",
      "content": "Indofood Sukses Makmur ([INDF]) recorded a relatively strong net profit of 4.9 trillion rupiah (+224% YoY, +249% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result caused the net profit for 9M24 to rise to 8.8 trillion rupiah (+24% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equates to 90%/94% of the FY24 Stockbit/consensus estimates. The strong net profit in 3Q24 was driven by foreign exchange gains of 3.4 trillion rupiah following the strengthening of the rupiah against the US dollar from 16,421 per the end of June 2024 to 15,138 per the end of September 2024. This exchange gain reversed the situation from the previous quarter, where INDF's net profit in 2Q24 was suppressed by exchange losses. Operationally, operating profit grew in 3Q24 to 5.3 trillion rupiah (+8% YoY, +3% QoQ). This result brought the operating profit for 9M24 to 16.3 trillion rupiah (+15% YoY) and exceeded expectations as it equates to 83%/73% of the FY24 Stockbit/consensus estimates, higher than the historical range of 72%. Generally, operating profit growth was due to revenue growth and maintained profitability. Revenue Growth Driven by ICBP and Agribusiness Segments. INDF's revenue increased to 29.6 trillion rupiah (+7% YoY, +12% QoQ) in 3Q24, resulting in revenue for 9M24 rising +4% YoY to 87 trillion rupiah, or equivalent to 74%/75% of the FY24 Stockbit/consensus estimates. Revenue growth was mainly driven by the consumer branded products segment under the main subsidiary, Indofood CBP Sukses Makmur ([ICBP]), which recorded relatively solid revenue growth at 18.8 trillion rupiah (+11% YoY, +9% QoQ) in 3Q24 and 55.6 trillion rupiah (+8% YoY) during 9M24. Additionally, the agribusiness segment also recorded solid quarterly revenue growth in 3Q24, amounting to +28% QoQ. Profitability Maintained, Supported by Agribusiness Segment. INDF's operating profit margin increased by +27 bps YoY to 17.7% in 3Q24, although it decreased by -149 bps QoQ. This result is still above our estimate which projects an operating profit margin of 16.8% for FY24. By segment, INDF's operating profit margin was supported by the performance of the agribusiness segment, which recorded an operating profit margin increase nearly 2 times to 22.4%/16.8% in 3Q24/9M24. The strong margin in the agribusiness segment can compensate for the weak margins from the other 3 segments, which experienced a decrease in operating profit margin respectively. We estimate that the strong margin in the agribusiness segment is due to the rise in CPO prices by about +6% during 3Q24, while the weak margin in the ICBP segment is estimated to be triggered by the increase in wheat prices by about +6% during 3Q24. Key Takeaway. In the previous quarter, we wrote that INDF's prospects in 2H24 have the potential to improve due to the recovery of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar which will reverse exchange losses, which has now been reflected in the 3Q24 performance. We identify 2 main factors that have the potential to affect INDF's performance in 4Q24: Risk of rupiah weakening against the US dollar which could cause INDF to record exchange losses. Currently, the rupiah against the US dollar is at the level of 15,700, weakening by about -4% compared to the closing of 3Q24. More favorable wheat and CPO prices open opportunities for maintained FY24 margins higher than our estimates. Wheat prices during October 2024 remained below 6 US dollars per bushel (vs. our assumption: 6.20 US dollars per bushel) can maintain the ICBP margin. From the agribusiness segment, margins can increase along with CPO prices which rose by about +15% in the last month to 4,700 Malaysian ringgit per ton (vs. our assumption: 3,700 Malaysian ringgit per ton).",

This result made the net profit for 9M24 become 1.2 billion US dollars (-3% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equates to 82%/96% of the FY24F Stockbit/consensus estimates. ADRO's revenue of -3.3% QoQ in 3Q24 and -10.6% YoY over 9M24 was much better than our expectation (-12.8% YoY) and consensus (-19.3% YoY) for FY24F. We estimate this result was supported by increased sales volume, considering that the Indonesian Coal Index (ICI) tended to stagnate in 3Q24. ADRO's gross profit margin at 37.1% in 3Q24 (vs. 2Q24: 37.9%) and 39.5% during 9M24 (vs. 9M23: 39.9%) was also better than our expectation which projected 38.4% for FY24F. We estimate that ADRO's cash cost during 9M24 was still below our expectation at 48.5 US dollars per ton, although it likely increased quarterly.",
