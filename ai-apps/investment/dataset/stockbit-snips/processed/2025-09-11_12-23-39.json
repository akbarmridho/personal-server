As we mentioned previously, with low market expectations, stock prices will potentially also be influenced by other factors, such as the strategic review currently being undertaken by ASII. In the past 1 month, automotive stocks have actually increased in price, with ASII +13.3%, AUTO +5.5%, and DRMA +3.6%. Specifically for ASII, we assess that investors need to monitor the progress of the company's capital management plan - including its subsidiaries like UNTR and AUTO - considering that more optimal balance sheet utilization potentially provides further room for strengthening in stock prices, in our opinion.",
