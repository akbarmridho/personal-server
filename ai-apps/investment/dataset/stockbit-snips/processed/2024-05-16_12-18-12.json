      "content": "The annual inflation rate in the US dropped to 3.4% YoY in April 2024 (vs. March 2024: 3.5% YoY inflation), in line with consensus expectations and ending the trend of the previous 3 months which consecutively exceeded expectations. On a monthly basis, the inflation rate also slowed to 0.3% MoM (vs. March 2024: 0.4% MoM inflation), lower than the consensus expectation which projected 0.4% MoM inflation. Meanwhile, core inflation leveled down to 0.3% MoM and 3.6% YoY in April 2024 (vs. March 2024: 0.4% MoM and 3.8% YoY inflation), in line with expectations and marking the lowest annual core inflation in the last 3 years. Nevertheless, this annual inflation rate is still above the Fed's target of 2% YoY. All three major US stock indices rose to their highest levels after the inflation data release on Wednesday (15/5) local time, with Nasdaq +1.4%, S&P 500 +1.17%, and DJIA +0.88%. On the same day, the 10-year US government bond yield fell -10 bps to 4.34%. The Indonesian capital market was also positively affected with the IHSG strengthening +0.93%, the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield dropping -5 bps to 6.93%, and the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar strengthening +0.8% to 15,944.",
