      "title": "AKRA: Low Performance Recovery in 3Q24, Below Expectations",
      "content": "AKR Corporindo [recorded](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202410/20241025140541-48093-0/akr%20corporindo_tbk_bilingual_30%20Sep%202024_release.pdf) a significant decline in net profit to 466 billion rupiah (-31% YoY, +14% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to only 1.5 trillion rupiah (-14% YoY), below expectations as it only accounted for 52% of the consensus FY24F estimate. The low net profit in 3Q24 was caused by a decrease in revenue and weak margins. - Low Recovery in Trading and Distribution Segment Profit before tax (PBT) for the Trading and Distribution segment - which contributes about 65-75% of AKRA's total PBT - decreased by -20% YoY during 9M24. This result was pressured by a -5% YoY decrease in Fuel Oil (BBM) sales volume due to issues with the RKAB permit in 1H24 and high rainfall at customer mine sites in 3Q24. Weak sales to the mining sector ultimately caused a significant drop in the margins of AKRA's Trading and Distribution segment. This is because sales to the mining sector have higher margins compared to customers from other sectors such as manufacturing and transportation. - JIIPE Land Sales of 70 ha in 4Q24, Target Downgraded Again AKRA Management revised down the guidance for JIIPE land sales for 2024 from 115 ha to 100 ha. This guidance revision was made after JIIPE land sales only reached 32 ha as of 9M24, equivalent to 32% of the new target and 28% of the old target. Previously, AKRA in 2Q24 had revised the guidance for JIIPE land sales from 130 ha to 115 ha. Although JIIPE land sales increased by +8% YoY to 32 ha during 9M24, PBT from the Industrial Estate segment dropped by -15% YoY. AKRA Management explained that the decrease in PBT from the Industrial Estate segment was due to a fair value adjustment in trade receivables because of longer payment terms from clients. - No Additional Interim Dividend AKRA Management confirmed that there will be no 2nd interim dividend distribution for the 2024 fiscal year. Previously, AKRA distributed an interim dividend of 50 rupiah per share in August 2024. For the 2023 fiscal year, AKRA distributed interim dividends 2 times, namely 50 rupiah per share in August 2023 and 25 rupiah per share in November 2023. Key Takeaway With these weak results, AKRA Management revised down the net profit guidance for 2024 from a range of +4-7% YoY to -14% YoY, or around the 2022 net profit level of 2.4 trillion rupiah. We assess that the consensus will again cut AKRA's performance estimates. In the last 3 months, the consensus has cut AKRA's net profit estimate for FY24F by -8% to 2.8 trillion rupiah. We predict this decline in net profit will impact the 2024 fiscal year dividend payout ratio, which will not be as high as in 2023 at 90%, considering AKRA still needs capex for the construction of a tank terminal in Morowali and the development of the JIIPE industrial area.",

This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to 16.3 trillion rupiah (+3.5% YoY), equivalent to 74% of the consensus FY24F estimate. The result was supported by a decrease in provision expenses to 1.8 trillion rupiah (+8% QoQ, -19% YoY) in 3Q24, so that provision expenses for 9M24 decreased to 5.2 trillion rupiah (-23% YoY). In terms of top line, Net Interest Income (NII) in 3Q24 increased to 10.4 trillion rupiah (+7% QoQ, -2% YoY), so that NII during 9M24 decreased by -5.5% YoY to 29.4 trillion rupiah. BSDE: Bumi Serpong Damai recorded marketing sales of approximately 2 trillion rupiah (+2.1% YoY, -23.8% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result brought marketing sales during 9M24 to approximately 6.8 trillion rupiah (+1.4% YoY), equivalent to 72% of the 2024 target of 9.5 trillion rupiah. The housing segment contributed 56% of total marketing sales during 9M24, followed by shophouses (23%), apartments (7%), commercial land (6%), and land plot sales to joint ventures (8%). ASRI: Alam Sutera Realty [recorded](https://investasi.kontan.co.id/news/alam-sutera-realty-asri-catat-marketing-sales-rp-23-triliun-per-september-2024) marketing sales of 1.1 trillion rupiah (+95% YoY, +76% QoQ) in 3Q24.

Corporate Secretary of ASRI, Tony Rudiyanto, said that the marketing sales realization was contributed by The Gramercy product in Alam Sutera, Sutera YMMA (Alam Sutera 2), Agra Cluster in Suvarna Sutera, and several commercial products. BNLI: Bank Permata [recorded](https://www.permatabank.com/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Laporan%20Publikasi_Sept%202024.pdf) a net profit of 1.3 trillion rupiah (+74% QoQ, +71% YoY) in 3Q24, resulting in a net profit for 9M24 reaching 2.8 trillion rupiah (+30% YoY). This result was supported by a significant drop in provision expenses to 147 billion rupiah (-75% QoQ, -77% YoY) in 3Q24, so that provision expenses for 9M24 decreased to 1.2 trillion rupiah (-36% YoY). In terms of top line, Net Interest Income (NII) in 3Q24 increased to 2.6 trillion rupiah (+4.4% QoQ, 3.9% YoY), so that NII during 9M24 grew +2.2% YoY to 7.6 trillion rupiah.

This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to 770.6 billion rupiah (-23% YoY), equivalent to 69% of the consensus FY24F estimate. This result was pressured by a decrease in revenue after profit sharing distribution to 1.2 trillion rupiah (-2.5% QoQ, -11% YoY) in 3Q24, resulting in revenue after profit sharing distribution during 9M24 being 3.7 trillion rupiah (-6.6% YoY). Weakness in the top line caused operating profit to also fall to 277.7 billion rupiah (-24% QoQ, -14% YoY) in 3Q24, so that operational profit for 9M24 reached 979.4 billion rupiah (-24% YoY). HEAL: Medikaloka Hermina [recorded](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202410/20241025090723-48168-0/HEAL_Billingual_30%20September%202024.pdf) a net profit of 125 billion rupiah (-14% YoY, -18% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to 468 billion rupiah (+34% YoY), equivalent to 75% of the consensus FY24F estimate. The decline in net profit in 3Q24 was mainly due to expenses growing higher - both COGS (+14% YoY) and opex (+10% YoY) - compared to revenue growth (+9% YoY), causing the operating profit margin in 3Q24 to drop to 14.9% (vs. 3Q23: 17.6%, 2Q24: 17.3%). DRMA: Dharma Polimetal [recorded](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202410/20241025161341-48357-0/DRMA%200924.pdf) a net profit of 175 billion rupiah (+1% YoY, +69% QoQ) in 3Q24. This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to 412 billion rupiah (-21% YoY). 3Q24 performance was relatively better compared to the previous 2 quarters, with net profit still managing to grow +1% YoY compared to declines in 1Q24 (-38% YoY) and 2Q24 (-20% YoY). The better performance was mainly due to the increased performance of the motorcycle segment which has the highest margin compared to other segments, thus lifting the overall margin. Revenue from the motorcycle segment grew +19% YoY in 3Q24 (vs. 1Q24: +2% YoY, 2Q24: +4% YoY). SMDM: Suryamas Dutamakmur [announced](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202410/d5f9fa35e9_4512deffa4.pdf) that Bumi Serpong Damai (BSDE), had acquired 4.4 billion (92%) shares of SMDM at a price of 531 rupiah per share on October 23, 2024. The total transaction value reached approximately 2.3 trillion rupiah. Following the completion of this transaction, BSDE will become the new controller of SMDM and will conduct a mandatory tender offer. Previously, BSDE in August 2024 [announced](https://snips.stockbit.com/snips-terbaru/bsde-berencana-akuisisi-smdm-rp24-t) that the company was negotiating with Top Global Ltd. - an entity still affiliated with the Sinar Mas family - to acquire approximately 92% of SMDM shares. BRMS: President Director of Bumi Resources Minerals, Agoes Projosasmito, stated that there is no effort from management to move the company's shares into the MSCI index constituents. However, Agoes explained that BRMS, through its subsidiary, PT Citra Palu Minerals (CPM), is indeed expanding. [Bloomberg Technoz](https://www.bloombergtechnoz.com/detail-news/52804/respons-agoes-projosasmito-soal-isu-brms-digiring-masuk-msci/2) reported that Agoes' statement emerged after market rumors suggested BRMS shares could enter the MSCI index if their share price reached the level of 400 rupiah per share. SIDO: Industri Jamu dan Farmasi Sido Muncul will [distribute](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202410/8d296453ce_7fec3c0aa6.pdf) an interim dividend for the 2024 fiscal year amounting to 540 billion rupiah or 18 rupiah per share.

Referring to SIDO's share price at the close of trading on Friday (10/25) at 615 rupiah per share, the indicative dividend yield is 2.9%.",
