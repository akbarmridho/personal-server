      "content": "The Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, Eyal Zamir, said on Tuesday (24/6) that Israel will respond to Iran \"with force\" after accusing Iran of violating the ceasefire agreement. Previously, the US government along with Qatar on Monday night (23/6) attempted to push Israel and Iran to reach a ceasefire by stopping their respective attacks, according to an Axios report. Axios continued that both parties had agreed to the ceasefire before US President Donald Trump announced it on the same night. However, Israel accused Iran of violating the agreement, with Israel claiming to have detected missile launches from Iran after the ceasefire. On the contrary, the Iranian military and state media denied Israel's accusations. Although Israel threatened to respond to Iran \"with force,\" Trump announced on Tuesday (24/6) that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran was officially in effect. Responding to recent developments, Brent futures prices for the August 2025 contract moved volatile throughout Tuesday (24/6) trading. Nevertheless, Tuesday's (24/6) intraday price at 69.1 US dollars per barrel (-3.3%) as of Tuesday afternoon was a continuation of the -7.2% drop on Monday (23/6), following Iran's failure to close the Strait of Hormuz and news of the ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, stock markets reacted positively on Tuesday (24/6) with Nikkei +1.16%, SSE +1.15%, and IHSG +1.21%. S&P Futures strengthened by +0.74% as of Tuesday afternoon after the S&P 500 rose +1% in Monday's (23/6) trading local time. Gold prices fell -1.26% to the level of 3,327 as of Tuesday afternoon.",

The stock increase was mainly caused by a decrease in export volume of -38.1% MoM to 1.78 million tons due to reduced demand. According to a trader from New Delhi, CPO exports increased in May 2025 thanks to CPO prices being traded at a relative discount compared to competing oils, thus likely lowering stock levels.",
