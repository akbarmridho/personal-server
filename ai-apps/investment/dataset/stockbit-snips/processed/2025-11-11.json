      "title": "Pertamina Discusses Progress of Pelita Air Merger with Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA)",
      "content": "The President Director of Pertamina, Simon Aloysius Mantiri, stated on Monday (10/11) that the merger plan between Pelita Air and Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA) is still ongoing under the coordination of Pertamina and Danantara. Communication between Pertamina through Pelita Air and $GIAA has begun, with all processes to be reported to Danantara for decision making. For Pertamina, this merger process is part of a business portfolio restructuring strategy to strengthen the company's focus on its core business. Meanwhile, the CEO of Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, stated that although this corporate action plan is still under review, the merger aims to make the state-owned airlines' operations more efficient and productive by optimizing existing assets. Updates regarding the merger process between the two companies emerged amid a downward revision of potential funds raised from $GIAA's private placement to ~23.7 trillion rupiah, from the previous ~1.85 billion US dollars or 30.8 trillion rupiah assuming an exchange rate of 16,686 rupiah per US dollar. This decrease was caused by a lower planned cash capital injection from PT Danantara Asset Management, reducing from previously ~1.4 billion US dollars or ~24 trillion rupiah to 17 trillion rupiah, while the planned conversion of shareholder loans remained unchanged at 405 million US dollars or ~6.8 trillion rupiah. $GIAA also removed fleet expansion from the stated use of funds based on the new disclosure, but maintained the use of funds for working capital and company operations, working capital and Citilink operations, and repayment of Citilink fuel purchase debt. With this change in the private placement value, the dilution of public share ownership also changed from previously decreasing to 5.03% to 6.17%. Before this corporate action plan, the public shareholder portion in $GIAA was 27.47%. This plan will be discussed in the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGMS) on November 12, 2025. Previously, Danantara's COO, Dony Oskaria, told Bloomberg Technoz in October 2025 that Danantara would hold a rights issue for $GIAA after the company completed the private placement. This plan is intended to increase the public ownership portion diluted after the private placement.",

The quarterly net profit growth in 3Q25 was supported by gross profit margin expansion to 22.7% (+229 bps QoQ) following a decrease in cash cost per ton (-6% QoQ) and a stripping ratio to 9.3x (vs. 2Q25: 9.8x). Revenue in 3Q25 increased +3% QoQ due to a rise in sales volume (+7% QoQ), despite the average selling price dropping -4% QoQ. For 9M25, net profit was still pressured by the weakening average selling price to 77 US dollars per ton (-21% YoY), causing the gross profit margin for 9M25 to drop to 23.9% (-505 bps YoY).
