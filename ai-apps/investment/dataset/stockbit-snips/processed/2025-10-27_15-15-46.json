      "title": "MSCI Plans to Use KSEI Data for May 2026 Free Float Calculation",
      "content": "MSCI announced it is seeking input from market participants regarding plans to use the Monthly Holding Composition Report published by KSEI as an additional reference in calculating the free float of Indonesian listed shares. Currently, issuers in Indonesia only report shareholders with ownership of â‰¥5% to the IDX, whereas KSEI data reports ownership based on shareholder classification, providing a more detailed picture of shareholders below 5%.Besides the plan to use the KSEI report as an additional reference, MSCI proposes that the free float estimate be determined based on the lowest value between: - The free float calculated using ownership data reported by issuers in disclosures, reports, and press releases, based on MSCI methodology; and - Proposed: The free float estimated based on KSEI data, by classifying script shares (not listed in KSEI data) and 'corporate' ownership (local and foreign) and 'others' (local and foreign) as non-free float. - Alternate: Alternatively, MSCI proposes a free float estimate based on KSEI data, by classifying script shares and 'corporate' ownership (excluding 'others') as non-free float.Note that this plan is not yet certain to be implemented and is still awaiting input from market participants. MSCI will receive input until December 31, 2025, with the results of the consultation to be announced before January 30, 2026. If the proposal is adopted, the changes will be implemented in the May 2026 index review.Key TakeawayGiven that this plan is not yet certain to be implemented and is still awaiting input from market participants, investors need to monitor further developments to be announced by MSCI. Based on simulations performed by MSCI as of September 30, 2025, generally, shares currently in the MSCI Indonesia index will experience a reduction in the Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF), potentially leading to outflows. Changes in FIF and their impact on market cap under each scenario, namely 'proposed' and 'alternate', can be seen in the table above. Some highlights from the simulation are: 1) BBCA potentially experiences the largest outflow (no. 2 in the 'alternate' scenario) nominally, but not proportionally; 2) proportionally, GOTO potentially experiences the largest FIF reduction; and 3) DSSA becomes the only issuer that potentially experiences an FIF increase and receives inflows.",

Generally, the performance in 3Q25 followed the trend of 9M25, with net profit declining year-on-year due to: 1) Pre-Provision Operating Profit falling by -9%/-7% YoY in 3Q25/9M25 due to a rise in opex (+25% YoY) amidst Net Interest Income (NII) growing only in the low-single digits; and 2) an increase in provision expenses of +22%/+10% YoY in 3Q25/9M25.

This result brought the net profit for 9M25 to 104 million US dollars (-22% YoY), below expectations as it equates to 67% of the 2025F consensus estimate. Although revenue grew solidly in 3Q25 (+12% YoY, +10% QoQ), the overall profit margin was pressured due to a surge in the cost of revenue (+34% YoY, +41% QoQ) and an increase in operating expenses to 9 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24: 2 million US dollars; 2Q25: 9 million US dollars). The increase in the cost of revenue was mainly caused by an increase in depreciation expense (+18% YoY, +8% QoQ) and a jump in wages and benefits expenses to 21 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24: 9 million US dollars; 2Q25: 5 million US dollars).",

Meanwhile, the operating profit margin expanded year-on-year to 9.7% in 3Q25 (vs. 3Q24: 9.0%), supported by a gross profit margin increase (+110 bps YoY) and more moderate opex growth (+14% YoY) compared to gross profit growth (+16% YoY).",
