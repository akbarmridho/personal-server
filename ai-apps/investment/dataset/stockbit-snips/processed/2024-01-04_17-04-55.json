      "title": "Crude Oil Prices Strengthen Following Explosions in Iran and Protests in Libya",
      "content": "Brent crude oil prices in the spot market have strengthened by +4.2% since closing on Tuesday (2/1) to a level of 79.35 US dollars per barrel. At least, there are two main factors that have been catalysts for the strengthening of crude oil prices in the last two days:\n\n- Explosions in Iran - On Wednesday (3/1), two explosions occurred near the funeral of an Iranian military commander. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the explosions that killed at least 103 people. On the other hand, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi blamed Israel for the explosion.\n- Closure of oil fields in Libya - The strengthening of oil prices was also driven by the closure of Libya's largest oil field, the Sharara Oil Field, on Wednesday (3/1). The oil field, which produces 300 thousand barrels per day, was shut down by local residents protesting high fuel prices in Libya and a lack of economic opportunities.\n\nThe escalation of geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, along with the shutdown of Libya's largest oil field, has triggered concerns about disruptions to the world's crude oil supply.\n\nAs of November 2023, Iran was the 8th largest crude oil producer in the world with a production of 3.12 million barrels per day, equivalent to ~3% of global production. Meanwhile, Libya is the 19th largest crude oil producer with a production of 1.2 million barrels per day. A reduction in crude oil production of 300 thousand barrels per day from Libya has the potential to reduce global crude oil supply by ~0.3%.\n\nResponding to rising oil prices, oil-related issuers experienced appreciation in today's trading, Thursday (4/1), with MEDC (+2.61%), ENRG (+2.5%), ELSA (+3.55%), WINS (+3.96%), LEAD (+2.99%).",
