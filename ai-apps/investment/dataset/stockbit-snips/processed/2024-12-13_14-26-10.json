      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto on Thursday (12/12) proposed abolishing regional elections (pilkada) because their implementation is very costly. Instead, President Prabowo proposed that regional heads be elected by the DPRD, which according to a Reuters report is similar to the process during the Soeharto era. It is not known whether President Prabowo will realize this proposal into regulation. Political analyst, Yoes C. Kenawas, told Reuters that President Prabowo's proposal does not make sense and could set back democracy in Indonesia, considering that regional elections are still the best way for the public to ensure accountable regional leaders.",

This is the 4th rate cut during 2024 and reflects a better inflation outlook ahead, with inflation expected to fall to 2.4% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. Nevertheless, borrowing costs remain tight because previous rate hikes are still affecting existing loans. The ECB also projected a slower economic recovery than previously expected, with economic growth projected at +0.7% in 2024, +1.1% in 2025, and +1.4% in 2026.",

      "title": "CBDK, PANI Subsidiary, Announces IPO with Valuation of IDR 17-23 Trillion",
      "content": "Bangun Kosambi Sukses ($CBDK), a subsidiary of Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua ($PANI), announced it will conduct an IPO by offering up to 566.89 million (10%) new shares in the price range of 3,000-4,060 per share. This implies that the IPO targets around 1.7-2.3 trillion Rupiah in proceeds, with a valuation of approximately 17-23 trillion Rupiah. CBDK operates in the PIK 2 area real estate sector, a collaboration between Agung Sedayu group and Salim group. CBDK became a subsidiary of PANI after being acquired using right issue funds in August 2022. Currently, the full prospectus for CBDK is not yet available. However, looking at CBDK's financial report as of 1H24, the company along with its subsidiaries and associated entities has a total consolidated land area of 735.2 ha, 50% of which is undeveloped land. After the IPO, CBDK shareholders will consist of PANI (45.9%), Agung Sedayu Group (22.05%), PT Tunas Mekar Jaya/Salim Group (22.05%), and the public (10%). The market cap valuation of CBDK during the IPO is still lower than its NAV valuation which reaches 107 trillion Rupiah*, with a Discount to NAV of about 78-84%. We believe this NAV is still reasonable because CBDK owns premium landbank, including CBD PIK 2. This also makes CBDK cheaper in terms of Discount to NAV compared to PANI whose market cap is already more premium than the NAV we estimate. Details of the estimated NAV for CDBK can be seen in the following table: All proceeds from the IPO will be used by CBDK for capital injection in the form of equity to its affiliate, PT Industri Pameran Nusantara, to finance the construction project for an MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions) building. Key Takeaway: After updating our NAV assumption based on the consolidated landbank owned by CBDK, the NAV of 107 trillion Rupiah represents a very significant Discount to NAV to the market cap, around 78-84%, and is larger than the property industry average. This makes CBDK's IPO valuation quite attractive. CBDK will conduct bookbuilding on December 13-20, 2024, with an estimated public offering on January 3-9, 2025, and an estimated listing date on January 13, 2025. *NAV assumption has been updated from our calculation in Stockbit Commentary published on Friday (13/12) morning, using the consolidated landbank owned by CBDK.",
