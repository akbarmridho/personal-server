      "title": "BI Rate Cut Following Trump's Reduction of Indonesian Tariffs",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to cut the BI Rate by 25 bps to 5.25% today, Wednesday (16/7), with the deposit facility and lending facility also cut by 25 bps each to 4.5% and 6% respectively. Before this announcement, the Bloomberg consensus expectation was split, with 55% expecting the BI Rate to remain unchanged and 45% expecting a 25 bps cut. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, explained that the decision considered: 1) inflation and core inflation projections for the next 2 years remaining low below the target midpoint of Â± 2.5%; 2) stability of the Rupiah exchange rate; and 3) efforts to encourage economic growth. Bank Indonesia maintained its economic growth target in the range of +4.6-5.4% YoY for 2025, which had previously been downgraded twice this year. Bank Indonesia noted that banking credit growth slowed to +7.77% YoY in 1H25 (vs. 5M25: +8.43% YoY), marking the weakest growth since June 2023 and lower than the 2025 target which had been downgraded by Bank Indonesia to the range of +8-11% YoY. This result was pressured by banking preference to place liquid funds in securities and a cautious stance in distributing credit. Nevertheless, Perry stated that his side still maintains the 2025 banking credit growth target in the range of +8-11% YoY, driven by expectations of improvement in 2H25 following the trade agreement with the US. Perry mentioned that trade uncertainty is slowly subsiding as the tariffs imposed by the US for Indonesian products drop from the previous level of 32% to 19%. Perry stated that lower interest rates could boost credit growth, while the tariff agreement with the US is expected to help businesses make future business decisions. Regarding the newly announced tariff reduction, the Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, told Bloomberg that the government is preparing a joint statement with the US which will detail additional information regarding this agreement. Here are the key points in the trade agreement, according to the US President's explanation, Donald Trump: 1. Indonesia will not impose import tariffs or non-tariff barriers on goods from the US. 2. Indonesia also agreed to import energy from the US worth 15 billion US dollars, US agricultural products worth 4.5 billion US dollars, and 50 Boeing aircraft. However, the time frame for the agreement to import goods from the US is still unknown. 3. Trump added that if there is transshipment from a country with higher tariffs, then those tariffs will be added to the tariffs paid by Indonesia.",

      "content": "Responding to these 2 developments, the Rupiah exchange rate weakened -0.11% to the level of 16,278, while the 10-year government bond yield was flat at 6.573% in today's trading, Wednesday (16/7). Meanwhile, the IHSG strengthened +0.7% to the level of 7,192, but this was more due to the significant rise of 2 large market cap stocks, namely DCII (+19.99%) and DSSA (+3.86%). The big banks were mixed with slight increases/decreases below 2%. The muted market movement is potentially caused by investor assessment that the developments above have a relatively limited impact on the outlook for the Indonesian economy, especially with the details regarding market access granted to the US in exchange for tariff reductions still unavailable. We assess that convincing improvement signs in economic indicators are needed before foreign investors become more interested in Indonesia.",

Previously, the launch of Kopdes Merah Putih was postponed from July 12, 2025, because President Prabowo still had other agendas abroad. Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Ferry Juliantono, stated that the initial financing for Kopdes Merah Putih will be channeled through a special KUR facility with a ceiling of up to 3 billion Rupiah per cooperative.",
