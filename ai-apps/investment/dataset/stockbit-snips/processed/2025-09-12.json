      "title": "US Inflation Aligns with Expectations, Fed Rate Cut On Track",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States increased in August 2025 compared to July 2025, although the increase remained in line with consensus expectations. The monthly and annual CPI inflation growth in August 2025 was the fastest since January 2025. The details are as follows:\n1. CPI month-over-month (MoM): 0.4% (consensus: 0.3%; July 2025: 0.2%)\n2. CPI year-over-year (YoY): 2.9% (consensus: 2.9%; July 2025: 2.7%)\n3. Core CPI MoM: 0.3% (consensus: 0.3%; July 2025: 0.3%)\n4. Core CPI YoY: 3.1% (consensus: 3.1%; July 2025: 3.1%)\n\nIn a separate report, the number of initial jobless claims rose by 27,000 last week to a level of 263,000, higher than the consensus expectation of 235,000.\n\nEarlier, on 9 September 2025, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said that the U.S. economy was likely to create 911,000 fewer non-farm payroll jobs than previously estimated over the 12-month period ending March 2025. This indicated that U.S. job growth had slowed before the aggressive import tariff policy of President Donald Trump. Reuters reported that the still-elevated inflation amid a weakening labor market raised concerns about U.S. economic uncertainty ahead, particularly the risk of stagflation.\n\nThe weak labor market reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at next week’s meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool on Friday (12 September), the probability that the Fed will cut rates next week reached 100%, with a 25-basis-point cut probability of 92.7% and a 50-basis-point cut probability of 7.3%.\n\nIn response to the U.S. inflation data, U.S. equity markets closed higher: the Dow Jones rose 1.36% to an all-time high of 46,108 on Thursday (11 September), while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each gained 0.85% and 0.72% respectively. On the same day, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 2.48 basis points to about 4.02%.\n\nIn Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 1.37% on Friday (12 September), with the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield falling 5.1 basis points to about 6.33% and the rupiah strengthening 0.51% against the U.S. dollar to 16,378 per dollar.\n\nKey Takeaway: The increasing certainty of a Fed rate cut could open space for Bank Indonesia to implement further rate cuts to support economic growth. Bloomberg consensus projects the BI rate to be at 4.75% by the end of 2025, implying one more 25-basis-point cut. We assess that the government’s success in reviving economic growth could become a positive catalyst to reverse foreign outflows. The government is also preparing a new stimulus package, the details of which (size, target recipients, and duration) need close monitoring by investors.",

      "content": "1. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Friday (12 September) that President Prabowo Subianto has ordered a new stimulus to boost the economy. According to Bloomberg, the stimulus includes: (1) tax incentives for hotels, restaurants, and cafés; (2) an extension of food assistance for three months; (3) expanded coverage of work-accident, unemployment, and death insurance for online-motorcycle-taxi drivers; (4) an internship program for fresh graduates; and (5) housing assistance. The Coordinating Ministry is discussing the details, so the exact amount and period are still unknown.\n2. Metro TV reported that the government has seized 148 hectares of PT Weda Bay Nickel’s mining land in Halmahera, North Maluku, due to alleged permit violations. The State-Owned Enterprises Ministry will manage the area and impose fines on PT Weda Bay Nickel. Bloomberg noted that this is the first enforcement action since President Prabowo pledged to crack down on mining law violations. Weda Bay Nickel’s concession covers 47,000 hectares and produced more than 30 million tonnes of nickel ore in 2024. The mine is owned by Tsingshan Holding Group, Eramet SA, and Aneka Tambang (ANTM). An Eramet spokesperson told Reuters that no significant impact on mining operations is expected.\n3. The government on Friday (12 September) handed over 674,178 hectares of seized palm-oil plantation land to state-owned PT Agrinas Palma Nusantara, bringing the total land transferred to the company to 1.5 million hectares. Reuters reported that this handover cements Agrinas’s status as the world’s largest palm-oil company by land area. The task force said Agrinas could produce 5.7 million tonnes of crude palm oil per year. An additional 1.8 million hectares are still being verified for possible transfer. Bloomberg reported that Agrinas, which currently operates 17 palm-oil mills, plans to add new mills to process the newly acquired estates and will cooperate with Palm Co. to produce the “Minyakita” cooking oil.\n4. The Chairman of Kalbe Farma (KLBF), Ronny Hadiana, bought 900,000 KLBF shares at an average price of 1,150 rupiah per share on 8 September 2025. The transaction value was about 1 billion rupiah. After the purchase, Hadiana’s direct ownership in KLBF remained roughly 0.2%.\n5. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) on Friday (12 September) awarded the Perkasa offshore block in East Java to TIS Petroleum (Asia) Pte. Ltd. The block is estimated to contain 228 million barrels of oil or 1.3 trillion cubic feet of gas. The ministry also announced the award of the Gagah block in South Sumatra, estimated to hold 173 million barrels of oil or 1.1 trillion cubic feet of gas.\n6. Victoria Insurance (VINS) plans a private placement of approximately 146.1 million shares (10% of its capital). The execution price and investors have not been disclosed. Proceeds will be used to strengthen the company’s capital structure to meet the minimum equity requirement of 250 billion rupiah, which must be satisfied by 31 December 2026. The plan will be discussed at the extraordinary shareholders meeting on 20 October 2025.",
