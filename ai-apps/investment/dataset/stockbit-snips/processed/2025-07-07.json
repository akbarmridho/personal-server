      "title": "Government to Pilot Village Cooperatives Starting 19 July 2025",
      "content": "Coordinator of Food Affairs Minister Zulkifli Hasan said that the pilot of the Red White Village Cooperative (Kopdes) will start on 19 July 2025, delayed from the original plan of 12 July 2025, with the official operational schedule on 28 October 2025. The pilot will involve about 100 cooperatives that have met the criteria as mock-up. Regarding funding, Deputy Minister of Cooperatives Ferry Juliantono said that state-owned banks (Himbara) are required to provide a credit ceiling of up to 3 billion rupiah per cooperative with an interest rate of 6 percent under the Red White Kopdes credit scheme. The loan has a tenor of 6 years for working-capital needs and 10 years for investment needs. However, the financing rules for Red White Kopdes have not yet been officially released by the government. The number of Red White Kopdes that have been legally established up to mid-2025 has reached 74,877 units, equivalent to 93 percent of the 80,480 units that have been formed, according to Zulkifli. Consequently, the total potential funding that Himbara could disburse amounts to 241 trillion rupiah. The allocation quota of credit distribution by each bank will be coordinated by the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, where Kontan reported that the credit distribution for Red White Kopdes is proposed to use the 2025 KUR ceiling. Zulkifli mentioned that the loan ceiling can be used starting 1 July 2025, although new funding will be disbursed only if the cooperatives have a solid business plan. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said that village funds will serve as collateral in case of default by the cooperatives. Previously, the involvement of Himbara in Kopdes attracted attention from observers regarding the risk of non-performing loans, especially as the MSME sector slows down. As context, Bank Indonesia recorded that the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for the MSME sector rose from 3.76 percent at the end of 2024 to 4.36 percent during the first four months of 2025. Red White Kopdes are cooperatives created as a government effort to strengthen village economies, including the development of grocery stores, village pharmacies, village clinics, savings-and-loan units, logistics, and cold storage facilities.",

Although the program is guaranteed by village funds, the risk of problems in the program can create uncertainty for banks. Meanwhile, the potential pressure on banks' net interest margin will depend on how large the mandatory funding is, i.e., whether credit for Red White Kopdes will reduce the KUR allocation or whether there will be additional funding beyond the existing allocation.",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 10 percent tariff on any country that aligns with an \"anti-American BRICS\" policy, without further detail. The statement appeared after BRICS last weekend agreed to continue discussions on a cross-border payment system for trade and investment. Previously, Trump had threatened a 100 percent tariff on BRICS if they abandoned the US dollar in bilateral trade. Indonesia has been a permanent member of BRICS since January 2025.\\n2. US Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick said that new tariffs imposed by the US government on trading partner countries will take effect on 1 August 2025. Bloomberg reported that Lutnick's statement indicated the US will give its trading partners that have not reached agreements time to negotiate after the deadline on 9 July 2025.\\n3. Reuters reported that the Indonesian Wheat Flour Producers Association (Aptindo) will sign a memorandum of understanding worth 1.25 billion US dollars to purchase at least 1 million tons of wheat per year from the United States for the period 2026-2030. The MOU is part of a 34-billion-dollar package offered by Indonesia to the United States in tariff negotiations. Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, is scheduled to travel to the United States on Monday (7 July) to oversee the tariff talks.\\n4. OPEC+ members on Saturday (5 July) agreed to increase production by 548,000 barrels per day in August 2025, the largest monthly increase since the group began restoring output in April 2025. By comparison, OPEC+ had approved increases of 411,000 barrels per day for May, June and July 2025, and 138,000 barrels per day for April 2025. With the August increase, OPEC+ will have restored about 1.9 million barrels per day of oil production since April 2025, offsetting the voluntary cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day made earlier by several member countries.\\n5. Bloomberg reported that Saudi Arabia raised the price of Arab Light crude for Asian buyers in August 2025 by 2.2 US dollars per barrel above the regional benchmark, marking the highest Arab Light price in four months. This indicates Saudi confidence that the market can absorb the additional OPEC+ supply. For context, Arab Light for Asian buyers in August 2025 was 1 US dollar per barrel higher than in July 2025, exceeding trader and refinery expectations of a 0.65-dollar increase.\\n6. The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded that domestic motorcycle sales in June 2025 reached 509,326 units (down 0.3 percent year-on-year, up 0.8 percent month-on-month). The result brings 1H25 domestic motorcycle sales to about 3.1 million units (down 2.1 percent year-on-year), representing 46-49 percent of the 2025 target of 6.4-6.7 million units (versus 50 percent achievement in 1H24).\\n7. Bank Indonesia reported that foreign exchange reserves at the end of June 2025 reached 152.6 billion US dollars (up from 152.5 billion US dollars in May 2025), driven by tax and service receipts and the issuance of a global sovereign bond amid policies to stabilise the rupiah. The reserve level at the end of June 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.4 months of imports or 6.2 months of imports and external debt service.",
