      "title": "The Fed Holds Interest Rates, Awaits Tariff Developments",
      "content": "The Fed on Wednesday (7 May) local time decided to keep the policy interest rate in the range 4.25-4.5%, in line with consensus expectations. The decision reflects a wait-and-see approach amid global uncertainty caused by US tariffs, although US President Donald Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates quickly. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it is still too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will be the main risk ahead. Generally, the Fed noted that the US economy continues to expand with solid growth. Although early estimates showed US GDP contracting at an annualized -0.3% in 1Q25, the Fed linked this to a surge in imports as firms stockpiled ahead of tariffs. The Fed also said the US labour market remains solid and inflation remains fairly high. Powell added that the Fed does not need to rush rate adjustments until there is more certainty about the direction of US trade policy. The US government appears inconsistent with its tariff policy, creating uncertainty. For example, a few days after announcing reciprocal tariffs, Trump decided to postpone the implementation of higher tariffs for 90 days to allow negotiations for affected countries, except China. This weekend the US will meet China in Switzerland, where Bloomberg reported the meeting will focus on de-escalation of the trade war. US financial markets were muted and mixed on Wednesday (7 May) following the decision and Fed comments. All three US equity indices rose: S&P 500 +0.43%, Nasdaq +0.27%, DJIA +0.70%. The DXY rose +0.45%, while the 10-year US Treasury yield increased 4 basis points to 4.31%. In Indonesia, the IDX Composite fell 1.42% on Thursday (8 May), while the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield was flat at 6.86% and the rupiah strengthened 0.25% to 16,495 per US dollar. Key Takeaway The market still expects the Fed to cut rates by 75 basis points by the end of 2025, based on the CME FedWatch Tool as of Thursday (8 May). Developments in trade negotiations will affect the Fed’s rate outlook and should be watched by investors. In addition to the planned meeting with China this weekend, the US will also sign a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday (8 May) local time, marking the first such deal since Trump announced reciprocal tariffs.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia reported that foreign exchange reserves in April 2025 fell to USD 152.5 billion (vs. March 2025: USD 157.1 billion), the lowest level since November 2024. The decline was driven by government external debt payments and BI’s effort to stabilise the rupiah amid market uncertainty. The reserve level in April 2025 is equivalent to 6.4 months of import financing or 6.2 months of import financing and government external debt payments.\n\nThomas Rookmaaker, Head of Asia-Pacific Sovereigns at Fitch, said on Wednesday (7 May) that Indonesia will face challenges to achieve 5% year-on-year economic growth in 2025 amid global trade war uncertainty and weakening consumer spending. Fitch has cut its Indonesia growth forecast by 0.1 percentage point to 4.9% YoY for 2025 and projects 2026 growth at 4.7% YoY. Nevertheless, Rookmaaker noted the slowdown will not change Indonesia’s rating, which remains ‘BBB’ with a stable outlook.\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration recorded that US crude oil inventories fell by 2 million barrels in the week ended 2 May 2025, exceeding the consensus expectation of a draw of 833,000 barrels.\n\nI Gede Nyoman Yetna, Director of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI), said on Thursday (8 May) that two lighthouse companies are slated to IPO on the Indonesian exchange in 2025, operating in the energy and consumer sectors, though identities were not disclosed. BEI also noted that 30 companies are scheduled for IPO in 2025, with 10 having assets over IDR 250 billion.\n\nOn Thursday (8 May) BEI released two new regulations establishing the legal basis for liquidity provider activities to deepen and improve market quality. The liquidity provider framework does not apply to all listed stocks; BEI will publish a list of eligible stocks every six months.\n\nSugiyanto Wibawa, Director of Aspirasi Hidup Indonesia (ACES), submitted his resignation on 6 May 2025. The plan will be discussed at the extraordinary general shareholders meeting on 17 June 2025.",
