      "title": "China Potentially Cuts Low-Grade Coal Imports",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that China is likely to cut imports of low-grade coal, which could be negative sentiment for its exporters like Indonesia. Bloomberg reported that this likelihood is based on coal supply glut in China and the Chinese government's efforts to tighten carbon emissions. China Huadian Corp. - one of the largest power plants in China - estimates total Chinese coal imports will only be around 400 million tons in 2025, significantly down from the record import of 543 million tons in 2024. China Huadian Corp.'s projection is even lower than the estimate from the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association earlier this year which predicted that Chinese coal imports during 2025 would range around 525 million tons. Li Xuegang, an analyst from the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association, stated that China's thermal coal imports have declined year-on-year for 3 consecutive months as of May 2025. Li predicts that this downward trend will accelerate further for the rest of this year. Previously, commodity analysis firm Kpler noted last week that thermal coal import volumes in Asia reached 74.12 million tons in May 2025, growing +8.1% MoM although still down -5.3% YoY. This result marks the highest monthly thermal coal import volume in the last 5 months, amidst falling coal prices from Indonesia and Australia to a four-year low due to increased domestic supply from China and India. Cumulatively during 5M25, thermal coal import volume in Asia fell -7% YoY to 346.96 million tons, according to Kpler data.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia recorded that the consumer confidence index (IKK) in Indonesia fell to 117.5 in May 2025 (vs. April 2025: 121.7), marking the lowest consumer confidence level since September 2022. The US statistics bureau recorded that the consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the US reached 2.4% YoY in May 2025 (vs. April 2025: 2.3% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation of 2.5% YoY although marking the first annual inflation increase in the last 4 months. On a monthly basis, US inflation reached 0.1% MoM (vs. April 2025: 0.2% MoM inflation), below the consensus expectation of 0.2% MoM. Core inflation in May 2025 remained steady at 2.8% YoY, unchanged for the last 3 months. CEO of BPI Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, stated that his company is considering potential investments in government waste management projects, including waste-to-energy conversion projects. Rosan also mentioned that Danantara will collaborate with private parties in waste-to-energy projects, although he did not elaborate further. The Minister of Environment, Hanif Faisol, stated that waste-to-energy projects have been included in the 2029 National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) targets. Bloomberg reported that President Prabowo Subianto will visit Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on June 18-20, 2025, thus missing the direct meeting with Western leaders at the G-7 Summit in Canada. Bloomberg reported that this raises questions about the direction of Indonesia's diplomatic strategy, although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson affirmed that Indonesia still adheres to the free and active foreign policy doctrine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also explained that the travel plan to Russia was designed long before the invitation from the G-7 Summit emerged. The Solvent Extractors' Association of India recorded that India's CPO imports rose +84% MoM in May 2025 to 592,888 tons, marking the highest monthly import volume since November 2024. Despite this, the volume is still lower compared to the historical average of Indian CPO imports which reached over 750,000 tons per month during the marketing year ending in October 2024. Agricultural industry research firm, GGN Research, estimates that Indian CPO imports will increase further in June 2025 with volumes potentially rising to the range of 850,000 tons, driven by cheaper CPO prices compared to soybean oil. Reuters reported that CPO traders expect India's vegetable oil imports to increase in the coming months, supported by the policy of reducing import tariffs on vegetable oil commodities in India this month.",
