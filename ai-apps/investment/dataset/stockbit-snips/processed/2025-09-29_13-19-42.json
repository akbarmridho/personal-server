      "content": "The Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, on Friday (26/9) stated that he did not order the state-owned bank association (Himbara) to raise the counter rate for US dollar-denominated deposits to 4% effective November 5, 2025. Purbaya added that the Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, also did not know why Himbara took this step. Himbara's move came after Purbaya said the government was preparing market-based incentives to encourage the placement of US dollar deposits domestically. However, Purbaya explained that the government is still considering these incentives for now. Purbaya also said he would not intervene in Himbara's operations, although he would \"suggest the banks improve\" their policies. Gold prices in the spot market rose +1.3% to 3,809 US dollars per troy ounce on Monday afternoon (29/9), after reaching 3,820 US dollars per troy ounce, which became an intraday all-time high. This increase was supported by rising demand for safe-haven assets amid uncertainty regarding the US government budget and expectations of The Fed cutting interest rates. The Director of Godrej International Ltd., Dorab Mistry, predicted that India's vegetable oil imports in 2025/2026 would increase by +4.6% YoY to 17.1 million tons, supported by CPO imports which are expected to rise by +13.4% YoY to 9.3 million tons. Previously, Mistry predicted CPO prices could rise to 5,000 ringgit per ton by the end of 2025 and 5,500 ringgit per ton in 1Q26. Mistry based these projections on the end of the CPO production cycle, the continuation of illegal palm plantation land appropriation by the Indonesian government, the plan to implement the B50 program next year, and high prices of substitute products like oilseed. The Director General of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir, estimated that Malaysia's palm oil stocks at the end of 2025 would fall by -23% to 1.7 million tons from the level at the end of August 2025, as production begins to decline post-seasonal peak and potential import increases by India. Malaysia's palm oil stocks in August 2025 were the highest since December 2023. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board estimates that Malaysian palm oil exports will increase from 16.9 million tons in 2024 to 17.3 million tons in 2025, higher than the previous projection of 17 million tons. Meanwhile, Malaysian palm oil production throughout 2025 is projected not to exceed 19.5 million tons, compared to 19.3 million tons in 2024. Reuters reported that OPEC+ is highly likely to increase oil production for November 2025 by at least 137,000 barrels per day at the meeting on October 5, 2025. Reuters sources mentioned that this move would be taken by OPEC+ as the group's effort to regain market share. Previously, OPEC+ had increased the production quota by more than 2.5 million barrels per day since April 2025, equivalent to ~2.4% of global demand. The US bureau of economic analysis noted that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index in the US experienced 0.2% MoM inflation in August 2025 (vs. July 2025: 0.2% MoM inflation), in line with consensus expectations. Annually, core PCE inflation reached 2.9% YoY (vs. July 2025: 2.9% YoY inflation), in line with consensus expectations and marking the highest level in the last 6 months. The core PCE index is the data viewed by The Fed to measure inflation progress against the target level of 2%. The European Union stated on Friday (26/9) that it would appeal the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling in the case filed by Indonesia regarding countervailing duties on biodiesel. This step was taken by the European Union after the WTO panel at the end of August 2025 supported Indonesia on several of its main claims in the dispute.",

The decline in net profit in August 2025 was driven by a weakening Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) which decreased by -11% YoY and -8% MoM. Meanwhile, the decline in net profit during 8M25 was caused by an increase in provision expenses (+4% YoY) and opex (+6% YoY) amid a slight decrease in Net Interest Income (-1% YoY).
