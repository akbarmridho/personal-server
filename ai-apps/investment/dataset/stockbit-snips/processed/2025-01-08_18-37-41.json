RATU was offered during the IPO at a valuation of 13.1x P/E 1H24 annualized, which is more premium compared to the valuation of its peers such as Medco Energi Internasional ($MEDC) at 4.9x P/E 9M24 annualized and Energi Mega Persada ($ENRG) at 5.5x P/E 9M24 annualized. We attempt to provide guidance on how investors can view and assess the prospects of this stock going forward, beyond short-term trading opportunities.",

      "content": "RATU is an oil and gas (O&G) holding company owned by Happy Hapsoro. This subsidiary of Rukun Raharja ($RAJA) holds a 2.2423% participation right in the Cepu Block through an associated entity with a 49% ownership, PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana (PJUC). Besides the Cepu Block, RATU also holds an 8% participation right in the Jabung Block through a subsidiary with 99% ownership, PT Raharja Energi Tanjung Jabung (RETJ).\nOverall, RATU's performance still grew in 1H24, where lower production in the Cepu Block was successfully compensated by improved performance in the Jabung Block. In 1H24, RATU recorded revenues of 28 million US dollars (+143% YoY) and net profit of 7.4 million US dollars (+20.3% YoY). The Jabung Block is the main contributor to net profit with a 58% contribution, while the Cepu Block contributed 42%.\nThe Jabung Block was only acquired by RATU at the end of 2023 with an acquisition value of 26.5 million US dollars for an 8% participation right in that block. This acquisition value is considered attractive because it implies an acquisition valuation per O&G reserve of 1.3 million US dollars per MMBOE, much cheaper compared to several similar acquisitions by other companies recently:\n- MEDC (2022) - Acquisition of 54% participation right in Corridor Block valued at 10.6 million US dollars per MMBOE\n- MEDC (2023) - Acquisition of 20% participation right in Blocks 48 and 60 in Oman valued at 11.4 million US dollars per MMBOE\n- Hibiscus Petroleum (2024) - Acquisition of 38% participation right in Maharajalela Block B in Brunei Darussalam valued at 12 million US dollars per MMBOE",

Although he did not specify the details of the block to be acquired, Maulidi mentioned that the participation right in that block would be relatively larger than the participation right in the Jabung Block. We estimate that this acquisition will eventually be carried out by RATU, as RAJA's subsidiary in the upstream O&G sector. Although details about this acquisition are not yet known, RATU at least has a strong capacity thanks to a solid balance sheet with low net gearing at 0.15x post-IPO, meaning the company has a good starting capital.",

      "content": "Although RATU still has potential for organic growth, we believe that assessing RATU solely based on organic growth factors is not very interesting due to its premium valuation compared to its peers. We tend to assess RATU as a growth stock, where the company has the potential for significant growth, but more by relying on inorganic means through the acquisition of O&G blocks. Therefore, the main key factor for RATU is the success of the company in expanding its O&G portfolio with reasonable acquisition valuations, both by increasing participation rights in existing O&G blocks and/or acquiring participation rights in other O&G blocks. We assess that RATU's success in executing this strategy will justify RATU trading at a premium. If the aforementioned acquisition plan can be executed again at an attractive valuation, we assess this will have a positive impact on the company. However, like a double-edged sword, failure to expand the O&G portfolio with reasonable acquisition valuations becomes the main risk for investors given RATU's premium valuation, thus having a large room for potential disappointment.",
