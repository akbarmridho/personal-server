      "title": "Adaro Group Performance 1H25: AADI Exceeds Expectations, ADRO Below Expectations",
      "content": "Adaro Group issuers, namely Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI) and Alamtri Resources Indonesia ($ADRO), have released their financial reports for the 2Q25 period. Here is a summary from us: AADI 1H25: Net Profit -50% YoY, Exceeds Expectations. AADI recorded a net profit of 233 million US dollars in 2Q25 (+19% QoQ, -60% YoY). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 429 million US dollars (-50% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equals 57% of the 2025F consensus estimate, thanks to a fairly resilient gross profit margin and efficient opex. 1. Revenue increase +6.1% QoQ - The revenue increase in 2Q25 was caused by a sales volume increase of +7.3% QoQ to the level of 17.58 million tons, while the average selling price (ASP) decreased by -1.3% QoQ to 67 US dollars per ton. 2. Net profit margin improvement to 18.8% - AADI recorded a net profit margin increase of +200 bps QoQ to 18.8% in 2Q25, primarily driven by the reversal of other losses: from a loss of 5 million US dollars in 1Q25 to a profit of 28 million US dollars in 2Q25. 3. Fairly resilient gross profit - AADI's gross profit still grew +0.2% QoQ in 2Q25 amidst a decrease in ASP. This gross profit growth was driven by more moderate growth in the cost of revenue, mainly due to a royalty expense decrease of -22% QoQ as a result of a lower royalty tariff determination for IUPK license holders by the government. 4. Production increase and stripping ratio - Operationally, AADI recorded an increase in production volume and stripping ratio. Production volume in 2Q25 rose +9% QoQ to 17.5 million tons, while the stripping ratio stood at 4.3x (vs. 1Q25: 3.2x). ADRO 1H25: Net Profit -78% YoY, Below Expectations. ADRO recorded a net profit of 98 million US dollars in 2Q25 (+28% QoQ, -76% YoY). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 175 million US dollars (-78% YoY), below expectations (39% of 2025F consensus estimate), due to the weak performance in 1Q25 despite performance improvements in 2Q25. 1. Revenue increase +25% QoQ, supported by the mining services segment - ADRO recorded revenue of 476 million US dollars in 2Q25 (+25% QoQ). Segmentally, revenue from the metallurgical coal segment grew +23% QoQ, while revenue from the mining services segment grew +32% QoQ. Metallurgical coal segment revenue was supported by a +25% QoQ increase in metallurgical coal sales volume amidst a -7% QoQ decrease in ASP. 2. Operating profit margin increase +950 bps QoQ - The operating profit margin increase to 30.3% in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: 20.8%) was driven by more moderate growth in the cost of revenue (+11.4% QoQ) and a -4.4% QoQ decrease in opex. 3. Production increase and decrease in stripping ratio - Operationally, ADRO experienced an increase in metallurgical coal production volume of +18.2% QoQ to 1.88 million tons. Meanwhile, the stripping ratio was recorded at a decrease to 3.3x (vs. 1Q25: 3.55x). Key Takeaway: We assess that AADI has the potential to continue its positive performance momentum in 2H25, driven by higher sales volume compared to the 1H25 realization. AADI management targets sales volume around 65-67 million tons throughout 2025, implying -1.2% YoY to +1.8% YoY compared to the 2024 realization. Coal prices themselves have recently been on an upward trend, so the ASP in 3Q25 has the potential to be better than the 2Q25 realization. From the cost side, AADI's performance will be more efficient in line with the setting of lower new royalty rates for IUPK permit holders as of 2Q25. Meanwhile, for ADRO, achieving performance against the 2025F consensus expectation is relatively more challenging given the performance realization during 1H25. In today\\'s trading, Monday (1/9), AADI closed stronger +2.17%, while ADRO fell -1.99%.",

This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 4.7 trillion rupiah (+203% YoY), exceeding expectations (67% of 2025F consensus estimate).

The annual net profit decline in July 2025 was caused by weak Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) which decreased by -10% YoY along with a Net Interest Income decline of -8% YoY. Meanwhile, the net profit decline over 7M25 was driven by: 1) weakening PPOP (-3% YoY) due to an opex increase of +6% YoY; and 2) an increase in provision expense of +6% YoY.
