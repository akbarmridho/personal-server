      "title": "Indonesian Trade Balance Surplus Below Expectation",
      "content": "BPS [noted](https://www.bps.go.id/id/pressrelease/2024/11/15/2344/ekspor-oktober-2024-mencapai-us-24-41-miliar--naik-10-69-persen-dibanding-september-dan-impor-oktober-2024-senilai-us-21-94-miliar--naik-16-54-persen-dibanding-september-2024.html) that Indonesia's trade balance surplus for October 2024 decreased to US$2.48 billion (-29% YoY, -23% MoM), falling below the consensus expectation which projected a surplus of US$3.05 billion. This result marks the 54th consecutive month of surplus. The decrease in Indonesia's trade balance surplus in October 2024 was caused by import growth of +18% YoY (vs. September 2024: +8.6% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of +7.1% YoY. On the other hand, export growth was only +10% YoY (vs. September 2024: +6.3%), although significantly higher than the consensus expectation of +3.8% YoY. The details are as follows: - Non-Oil and Gas Trade Balance Surplus Decreased to US$4.8 billion Non-oil and gas exports in October 2024 grew to US$23.1 billion (+11% YoY, +10% MoM). This result was supported by almost all commodity groups, with fats and oils of animal or vegetable origin (+25% YoY) experiencing the largest growth. Sectorally, non-oil and gas export growth was driven by the non-oil and gas processing industry products (+14% YoY), mainly through CPO exports. In October 2024, the largest non-oil and gas exports were directed to China (-2% YoY), the US (+29% YoY), and India (+8% YoY). Meanwhile, non-oil and gas imports were recorded at US$18.3 billion (+18% YoY, +12% MoM) in October 2024. Non-oil and gas import growth occurred across all main non-oil and gas commodity groups, except for machinery and mechanical appliances and their parts. The largest growth came from electrical machinery and equipment and their parts, which grew by +18% YoY. The largest sources of non-oil and gas imports were China (+20% YoY), Japan (-3.8% YoY), and Singapore (+41% YoY). - Largest Oil and Gas Deficit in 1 Year Indonesia's oil and gas trade deficit reached US$2.3 billion (+26% YoY, +69% MoM) in October 2024, marking the largest deficit in the last 1 year. This result was caused by higher growth in oil and gas imports (+14% YoY, +45% MoM) compared to the growth in exports (-1.8% YoY, +17% MoM). The high oil and gas imports were driven by increased imports of crude oil (+18% YoY) and petroleum products (+13% YoY). During 10M24, Indonesia's trade balance surplus reached US$24.43 billion (-22% YoY), with a surplus in the non-oil and gas sector of US$41.8 billion (-11% YoY) and a deficit in the oil and gas sector of US$17.4 billion (vs. 10M23: deficit of US$15.8 billion). Key Takeaway The value of Indonesia's trade surplus going forward is at risk of declining/decreasing due to protectionist policies from the elected President Donald Trump, both directly and indirectly. Direct negative impacts may arise from trade between Indonesia-US, where the US contributed 11% of Indonesia's total gross non-oil and gas exports during 10M24. The indirect impact comes via the weakening of the Chinese economy due to the trade war with the US, where China contributed 24% of Indonesia's total gross non-oil and gas exports during 10M24. On the other hand, the continuously widening Indonesian oil and gas deficit underscores the urgency for Indonesia to increase domestic oil and gas production and energy self-sufficiency, which is also one of the main programs/focus areas of the new government under President Prabowo Subianto.",
