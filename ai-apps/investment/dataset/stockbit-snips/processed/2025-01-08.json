The reserve level is equivalent to financing 6.7 months of imports or 6.5 months of imports and external debt payments of the government, above the international adequacy standard of about three months of imports. The increase was driven by tax and service receipts, government foreign borrowing, and oil and gas foreign exchange earnings.",

He explained that the HGBT subsidies are intended to support economic growth and improve the competitiveness of national industry, and that companies that have recorded a good internal rate of return may be removed from the list of HGBT recipients. The statement came one month after the Acting Director General of Oil and Gas, Dadan Kusdiana, said that the Ministry of Industry had recommended adding 15 new sub-sectors as HGBT recipients. Previously, only seven industry sectors received the subsidy, namely ceramics, fertilizer, petrochemical, oleochemical, steel, glass, and rubber gloves.",

      "content": "Raharja Energi Cepu (RATU) officially listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange on Wednesday (8/1) at an IPO price of IDR 1,150 per share and closed up 25%, reaching the auto-reject upper limit (ARA) at IDR 1,435 per share. At the IPO, RATU was offered with a valuation of 13.1 times 1H24 annualized P/E, more premium than peers such as Medco Energi Internasional (MEDC) at 4.9 times 9M24 annualized P/E and Energi Mega Persada (ENRG) at 5.5 times 9M24 annualized P/E. The analysis provides guidance on how investors may view the stock's prospects beyond short-term trading opportunities. RATU is a holding company in oil and gas owned by Happy Hapsoro. Its subsidiary Rukun Raharja (RAJA) holds a 2.2423% participation in the Cepu Block through a 49% joint venture with PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana (PJUC). RATU also holds an 8% participation in the Jabung Block through a 99% owned subsidiary PT Raharja Energi Tanjung Jabung (RETJ). Overall, RATU's performance grew in 1H24, with a production decline in Cepu offset by improved performance in Jabung. In 1H24, RATU recorded revenue of USD 28 million (+143% YoY) and net profit of USD 7.4 million (+20.3% YoY). Jabung contributed 58% of net profit and Cepu 42%. Jabung was acquired at the end of 2023 for USD 26.5 million for an 8% stake, implying an acquisition valuation of USD 1.3 million per MMBOE, much cheaper than recent comparable acquisitions: MEDC acquired 54% of Corridor Block in 2022 at USD 10.6 million per MMBOE, MEDC acquired 20% of Blocks 48 and 60 in Oman in 2023 at USD 11.4 million per MMBOE, and Hibiscus Petroleum acquired 38% of Block B Maharajalela in Brunei in 2024 at USD 12 million per MMBOE. RATU plans a new acquisition. On 16 October 2024, RAJA CEO Djauhar Maulidi announced that the company entered the final stage of talks to acquire a larger participation in a new oil and gas block, larger than its stake in Jabung. The acquisition is expected to be carried out by RATU, the upstream subsidiary of RAJA. RATU has a strong balance sheet with low net gearing of 0.15x post-IPO, providing solid capital. RATU forecasts that total oil and gas production from Jabung and Cepu in 2025 will be similar to the previous year, with production growth targeted for 2026, especially in Cepu through the Banyu Urip Infill Clastic program. Even without production growth, RATU expects double-digit revenue growth in 2025. The key takeaway is that while RATU has organic growth potential, its premium valuation relative to peers makes it less attractive on organic growth alone. The company is viewed as a growth stock, relying on inorganic growth through acquisitions of oil and gas blocks. The main factor for RATU is the success of expanding its oil and gas portfolio at reasonable acquisition valuations, whether by increasing participation in existing blocks or acquiring new ones. Successful acquisitions at attractive valuations would support a premium trading price, while failure to do so poses a major risk given the stock's premium valuation.",
