      "content": "The IHSG strengthened by +2.11% to the level of 7,196.02 today, Tuesday (3/11), accompanied by a foreign inflow of 2.08 trillion rupiah. This is the first inflow - both for the regular market and overall - after consecutive outflows since November 6, 2024, which was the main factor causing the IHSG to dive -4.12% in the last 1 month. Looking at the nominal size, today's foreign inflow is the largest since September 19, 2024, when the inflow was also recorded at 2.08 trillion rupiah. Today's foreign inflow consisted of 797 billion rupiah in the regular market and 1.3 trillion rupiah in the cash and negotiation markets.",

      "title": "Government Policy Updates",
      "content": "The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that the government will start implementing biodiesel with a 50% palm oil blend or B50 starting in 2026, faster than the previous plan which targeted to start in 2028. Bahlil mentioned that the acceleration of B50 implementation is aimed at reducing diesel imports. Previously, the Ministry of Agriculture estimated that the application of B50 would require a supply of 20 million kiloliters of CPO per year, higher than B35 (13.4 million kiloliters per year) and B40 (16.08 million kiloliters per year). The government itself will start implementing B40 in January 2025. A senior researcher at the Institute for Economic and Social Research, Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Indonesia, Riyanto, estimated that car sales in 2025 will drop by -12% YoY to the level of 700,000-750,000 units if the government implements a Value Added Tax (VAT) of 12% and an excise tax surcharge starting January 2025. Meanwhile, the Vice President Director of PT Toyota Astra Motor, Henry Tanoto, stated that the increase in VAT and excise tax surcharge will affect vehicle selling prices and people's purchasing power, potentially pushing the domestic automotive market lower. The excise tax surcharge itself is an additional tax levy based on a certain percentage, where the district/city government will collect the surcharge from motor vehicle tax (PKB), motor vehicle name transfer tax (BBNKB), and non-metal and rock mineral tax (MBLB). On another note, a fiscal policy analyst at the Fiscal Policy Agency of the Ministry of Finance, Rustam Effendi, said that the excise tax surcharge for PKB and BBNKB does not need to be worried about because it will not add to the taxpayer's burden. The Director General of Customs and Excise of the Ministry of Finance, Askolani, stated that the government will announce an increase in the retail selling price (HJE) of tobacco products in the near future, although he did not provide further details. Responding to this discourse, the Chairman of the Indonesian Cigarette Manufacturers Association, Henry Najoan, mentioned that they hope the government will not increase the HJE or cigarette excise tax until 2027, considering the cigarette industry is still struggling to recover post-cigarette excise tax hikes in recent years. Henry mentioned that an increase in cigarette HJE amidst declining public purchasing power will make illegal cigarette products more widespread. The Deputy Minister of Industry, Faisol Reza, stated that the government plans to increase the minimum domestic content level (TKDN) requirement for smartphones sold in Indonesia. Faisol mentioned that the government is currently discussing this plan, so the new TKDN ratio or when the regulation will be implemented cannot yet be determined. This plan to increase TKDN comes amid Apple Inc.'s (Nasdaq: AAPL) efforts to sell the iPhone 16 series in Indonesia. In recent recent weeks, Apple has increased its investment offer in Indonesia from US$10 million to US$100 million to obtain a 40% TKDN certificate so that the iPhone 16 series can be sold in Indonesia, but the government rejected the proposal because it considered the amount still too small compared to Apple's investments in other countries. The Director of the Indonesia Stock Exchange, Irvan Susandy, stated that starting December 9, 2024, they will expand the list of stocks that can be traded in the pre-opening session. Later, stocks listed on the main board, new economy, and development boards can be traded in the pre-opening session. This provision will be effective from December 9, 2024. Currently, stocks that can be traded in the pre-opening session are only the constituent stocks of the LQ45 index.",

Monetary policy support will be crucial for the Chinese economy next year, especially amid the threat of increased import tariffs proposed by the US President-elect, Donald Trump. The imposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports will threaten the country's export prospects, which has been a driver of China's economic growth since the pandemic. Bloomberg reported that the Chinese economy has shown signs of stabilization in recent weeks, mainly after the central bank and the Chinese government released a stimulus package at the end of September 2024. The Governor of the Bank of Japan, Kazuo Ueda, signaled that the central bank will raise interest rates again at the meeting on December 19, 2024. If realized, this step will mark the first time Japanese interest rates have been raised 3 times in a calendar year since 1989. Ueda mentioned that the time to raise interest rates is near given that inflation remains persistent, companies plan to invest, and wages are rising.",
