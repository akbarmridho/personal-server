      "title": "2024 Issuer Performance Compilation: Part 2",
      "content": "After releasing the performance compilation of issuers in consumer-related sectors in Stockbit Snips previously, we also created a compilation of FY24 performance from issuers closely related to industrials, including cement, building materials, automotive, utilities, industrial property, industrial supports. Here is the breakdown of revenue, operating profit, and net profit for each sector: .png) Key Takeaway - Generally, the revenue trend for industrial issuers is still growing positively year-on-year, both in 4Q24 and in FY24. Although total revenue only grew slightly by +0.1% YoY in 4Q24 and +2% YoY during FY24, this figure was mainly caused by a revenue decline in the industrial support sector. Beyond that, the revenue of other sectors grew quite well. - From the aspect of operating profit margin, there was a tendency for margin weakening during FY24, although there were signs of recovery in 4Q24 in the cement and building materials sectors. Thus, operating profit tended to grow lower compared to revenue. - On the bottom line, there were several boosts to net profit in several sectors, such as lower interest and tax expenses in the utilities sector and asset sales in the automotive sector. Highlights of several sectors include: - Industrial property had the relatively best performance during FY24, with revenue and net profit growing by +25% YoY and +14% YoY, respectively, driven by high industrial land sales from land purchases made by BYD. - Industrial support (AKRA) recorded negative performance during FY24 with a revenue decrease of -8% YoY and net profit of -20% YoY, primarily due to price normalization in the oil distribution and trade segment and lower JIIPE land sales. - The cement sector booked a significant recovery continuation in 4Q24 with net profit growing by +39% YoY, mainly driven by margin improvement from lower energy costs.",

      "content": "The Head of the Macroprudential Policy Department of Bank Indonesia, Solikin M. Juhro, said on Wednesday (26/3) that Indonesia's current economic fundamentals remain solid and are not as vulnerable as during the 1998 crisis. Solikin's comment emerged after the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened up to the level of 16,641 on Tuesday (25/3) morning, marking the weakest level since June 1998. Juhro stated that Indonesia currently has a stronger policy design, macroeconomic governance, and financial stability supervision system compared to 27 years ago. He added that the central bank will continue to monitor and maintain financial stability together with the government. US President, Donald Trump, on Wednesday (26/3) signed a proclamation to implement a 25% tariff on car imports starting April 3, 2025, designed to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US. The tariff will apply not only to completely built-up imported cars but also target spare parts, including engines, transmissions, powertrain components, and electrical components. Tariffs on spare parts will take effect no later than May 3, 2025, with the list of affected spare parts potentially expanded in the future. Special Staff to the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Raden Pardede, said on Thursday (27/3) that President Prabowo Subianto will meet with investors after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, aiming to correct misperceptions regarding government policy. Previously, the Chairman of the National Economic Council, Luhut Pandjaitan, claimed on Wednesday (26/3) that President Prabowo intends to meet directly with investors and capital market analysts to ensure a healthy and competitive investment climate, although he did not elaborate further. Meanwhile, the President Director of the IDX, Iman Rachman, said on Thursday (27/3) that so far his office has not received information regarding President Prabowo Subianto's planned meeting with capital market players. Since the beginning of the year, the IHSG has weakened by -8% YTD as of Thursday (27/3), in line with the emergence of several negative sentiments from domestic issues and global uncertainty from trade war escalations. Reuters reported that an entity controlled by the Widjaja family has offered to buy out the remaining public shares in Sinar Mas Land (SGX: A26) listed on the Singapore exchange. The transaction plan was offered at 0.31 Singapore dollars per share, which is 12.7% higher than Sinar Mas Land's last trading price. The Widjaja family currently owns 65.75% of Sinar Mas Land through their family trusts. The Widjaja family stated that the offer provides an opportunity for Sinar Mas Land shareholders to exit and reinvest their capital directly into Sinar Mas group property companies listed on the IDX, such as Bumi Serpong Damai (BSDE) and Puradelta Lestari (DMAS). Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) announced on Wednesday (26/3) that the iPhone 16 series will start selling in Indonesia on April 11, 2025, following the lifting of the sales ban after the company agreed to an investment plan worth over 300 million US dollars in Indonesia. Previously, the government banned the sale of the iPhone 16 series in 2024 because Apple failed to meet the domestic component level (TKDN) requirements.",
