      "content": "President-elect, Prabowo Subianto, on Monday (14/10) evening summoned a number of prospective ministers and deputy ministers for the upcoming cabinet. Here are some of our important notes: Number of ministries increases - Prabowo summoned 49 people last night and confirmed that there will still be summons for the remaining prospective ministers and deputy ministers on Tuesday (15/10). Although it is not yet known which ones will become ministers and deputy ministers along with their respective ministries, the number of summons appears to be in line with reports that the number of ministries will increase in the next government. Some time ago, it was reported that the next government would have 46 ministries, an increase from the current 34 ministries. Ministers related to the economy - 10 out of 17 ministers whom we assess are directly related to the economy in the current government were also summoned last night. This is in line with reports some time ago that Prabowo would retain many ministers from the current cabinet. Responding to last night's summons, Sri Mulyani stated that she was re-asked to become the Minister of Finance. Sri Mulyani also signaled that she is open to continuing in that position. Plan for the separation of the State Revenue Agency (BPN) - On the same occasion, Sri Mulyani dismissed the issue of establishing the BPN. Previously, Prabowo was reported to plan to separate the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) and the Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DJBC) from the Ministry of Finance in his efforts to increase state revenue levels.",

      "content": "Although further clarification or information is still needed, we assess the political developments above as tending to be positive for the market. If the current economic ministers return to serve in related economic ministries in the next government, this will provide certainty and relief for the market that economic stability can be maintained. However, the risk comes from the significant addition in the number of ministries which has the potential to cause inefficiency. In today's trading, Tuesday (15/10), the IHSG strengthened +0.89% to the level of 7,627 with a net foreign inflow of 289.5 billion rupiah. Meanwhile, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened slightly by -0.13% to the level of 15,575, although it still outperformed the movements of the exchange rates of several neighboring countries against the US Dollar, such as Malaysia (-0.30%), Thailand (-0.05%), and the Philippines (-0.65%).",
