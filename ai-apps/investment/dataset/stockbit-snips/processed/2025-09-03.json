      "title": "PANI Plans Rights Issue to Increase Stake in CBDK",
      "content": "Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua (PANI) plans to conduct a rights issue of up to 1.21 billion new shares. The execution price has not been announced, but PANI assumes the proceeds will be approximately IDR 16.73 trillion, as disclosed in its information statement (https://emitten-announcement.stockbit.com/attachments/f-31936480-0_PANI_Informasi_Transaksi_Afiliasi_31936480_lamp1.pdf).\n\nThe proceeds from the rights issue will be used for: 1) purchasing shares of Bangun Kosambi Sukses (CBDK) up to 44.1% from PT Agung Sedayu and PT Tunas Mekar Jaya for IDR 16.125 trillion, which would raise PANI’s ownership in CBDK from 45.9% to approximately 90%; and 2) a capital increase in three PANI subsidiaries.\n\nPANI will hold an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPSLB) on 9 October 2025 to seek shareholder approval for this corporate action.\n\n**Estimated Minimum Issue Price** – Assuming the IDR 16.73 trillion proceeds from the issuance of up to 1.21 billion shares, the estimated minimum issue price is around IDR 13,800 per share. Note that PANI has not announced the final issue price. The price could be significantly higher than the estimate (e.g., above the market price) if the company issues fewer shares than the maximum planned. For comparison, in the 2023 rights issue, PANI ultimately issued about 2.1 billion new shares out of an initial plan of 8 billion.\n\n**Estimated Purchase Price for CBDK Shares – IDR 6,450 per Share** – Using the transaction value of IDR 16.1 trillion for the 44.1% stake in CBDK implies a 100% valuation of CBDK at roughly IDR 36.6 trillion, or about IDR 6,450 per share. This estimate is close to CBDK’s closing price on the previous trading day (Tuesday, 2 September) of IDR 6,550 per share. As there is no change in CBDK’s controlling shareholder after the transaction, a mandatory tender offer for CBDK is unlikely.\n\n**Key Takeaway** – We estimate CBDK’s current NAV at IDR 146 trillion, implying PANI’s NAV (45.9% stake) at about IDR 286.6 trillion. Assuming PANI’s stake in CBDK rises to ~90%, PANI’s NAV would rise to roughly IDR 351.1 trillion, a +23% or IDR 64.5 trillion increase from the current estimate (see table above).\n\nAssuming a CBDK NAV of IDR 146 trillion, the transaction values the acquisition at a 75% discount to NAV. We consider the valuation cheap, especially given that part of CBDK’s landbank is located in the more developed CBD PIK 2 area with a premium location. The estimated NAV uplift of about IDR 64.5 trillion, or roughly +23% from the current level, also appears higher than the potential dilution from the rights issue.",

      "title": "Key Macro & Policy Updates – 2 September 2025",
      "content": "Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, said on Tuesday (2 September) that BI will support the state budget financing through a new burden-sharing agreement with the government. BI will bear part of the interest cost on certain government bonds bought in the secondary market, with the proceeds used to finance programmes such as the construction of three million houses per year and the Red-White Village Cooperatives. The spread between the 10-year government bond yield and the government-deposit rate will be split 50-50 between BI and the Ministry of Finance. The duration of the scheme and the amount of bonds covered have not been disclosed. Warjiyo also noted that BI has purchased about IDR 200 trillion of government bonds in the secondary market this year, without specifying how much of the interest cost is being covered.\n\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani said on Tuesday that the government will not introduce new taxes nor raise tax rates in 2026, even though the 2026 State Budget targets a 9.8% YoY increase in state revenue and a roughly 13% YoY rise in tax receipts versus the 2025 budget outlook. She said the revenue target will be achieved through improved taxpayer compliance and that the government will ensure that higher-income groups can pay taxes easily while low-income groups remain protected through incentives.\n\nGovernor Warjiyo also said the central bank expects banking credit growth of 9-12% YoY in 2026, compared with a projection of 8-11% YoY for 2025. He added that BI continues to look for room to cut policy rates given low inflation, a stable rupiah, and the need to spur economic growth.\n\nThe Chairman of the Indonesian General Insurance Association, Budi Herawan, said the association will request the OJK this month for an extension or relaxation of the first-stage minimum capital requirement that will take effect on 31 December 2026. The request reflects the insurance industry’s challenges in meeting the requirement amid an uncertain economic environment. The OJK’s earlier regulation (POJK No. 23/2023) mandates a minimum capital of IDR 250 billion for conventional insurers, IDR 100 billion for sharia insurers, IDR 500 billion for re-insurers, and IDR 200 billion for sharia re-insurers.",
