      "title": "Danantara Investasi US$5 Miliar pada 2025; Rumor Suntikan Dana untuk GIAA",
      "content": "Managing Director Finance BPI Danantara, Arief Budiman, said on Tuesday (3/6) that the firm will inject an investment of US$5 billion or approximately IDR 81 trillion by the end of 2025, which will be focused on eight sectors. The funds will come from dividend receipts from state-owned enterprises that are targeted to reach IDR 120 trillion in 2025. The eight sectors are mineral downstreaming, new renewable energy, digital infrastructure, health services, financial services, utility infrastructure, industrial estates, as well as food and agriculture. Arief explained that the sector selection is based on their contribution to national economic growth and return opportunities. He also mentioned that besides dividend reallocation, Danantara hopes to obtain co-investment in the form of funding, capabilities, or competitiveness that Indonesia currently lacks. The statement came amid Bloomberg reports that Danantara will inject about US$500 million or ~IDR 8.1 trillion into Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA). Bloomberg said the injection could be done in two stages, with the first stage possibly completed as early as June or July 2025. Part of the capital is reported to be given to GIAAâ€™s subsidiary Citilink to restore operations of more than a dozen aircraft. If realized, this would be Danantaraâ€™s first corporate investment since its establishment in early 2025. Bloomberg also reported that the government is considering transferring control of Citilink to Pertamina, adding that discussions are still unclear and no decision has been made. A Pertamina spokesperson told Bloomberg that the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry once suggested merging Pelita Air and Citilink, although no recent information is available. Pelita Air is currently controlled by Pertamina. The issue of Citilinkâ€™s control is new, given that the government has been discussing consolidation of Pelita Air with GIAA and Citilink since 2023. Previously, in January 2025, the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, said the consolidation of GIAA, Pelita Air and Citilink was targeted to be completed within six months.",

      "content": "1. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) again cut Indonesiaâ€™s economic growth projection to +4.7% YoY for 2025 and +4.8% YoY for 2026 in an outlook released in early June 2025, each 0.2 percentage points lower than the March 2025 outlook. The cut marks the second OECD outlook reduction for Indonesia this year, following the March 2025 downgrade. The government still targets a 5.2% YoY growth for 2025.\n2. U.S. President Donald Trump, on Tuesday (3/6), signed an order to raise steel and aluminium tariffs from 25% to 50% effective 4 June 2025, justified as a measure to help domestic producers and protect U.S. national security. Bloomberg noted the new policy rests on weaker legal grounds after the U.S. International Trade Court recently overturned many tariffs Trump had imposed under emergency legislation. The tariff increase includes an exemption for the United Kingdom, where the import duty will remain at 25% to allow the U.S. and the U.K. to continue trade negotiations before the 9 July 2025 deadline.\n3. Investor Daily reported that Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said he is an informal, unpaid advisor to BPI Danantara. Previously Bloomberg reported that Dalio declined a formal advisory role with Danantara. Bloomberg also said Dalioâ€™s name was removed from Danantaraâ€™s advisor list in a presentation to foreign investors in May 2025. The claim was refuted by Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani.\n4. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto, on Wednesday (4/6), said the Indonesian government will provide a list of tariff preferences for U.S. imports before the second round of trade talks scheduled for this month. He added that Indonesia is ready to accelerate negotiations with the United States before the 3 July 2025 deadline.\n5. Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia, on Tuesday (3/6), claimed that a battery ecosystem project worth US$6-7 billion owned by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) and Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC) will start groundbreaking in the third week of June 2025 in East Halmahera, North Maluku.\n6. S&P Global recorded that Chinaâ€™s manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI) fell to 48.3 in May 2025 (April: 50.4), below the consensus expectation of 50.6. This is the lowest manufacturing PMI since September 2022 and marks the first contraction in eight months amid the U.S. trade war. Despite the decline, business sentiment improved, supported by hopes of better trade conditions.\n7. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings in the United States rose by 191,000 to about 7.39 million in April 2025, surpassing the consensus estimate of 7.1 million.",
