      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate Amid Rupiah Weakness",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (12/18) decided to maintain the BI Rate benchmark interest rate at the level of 6%, with the deposit facility and lending facility maintained at 5.25% and 6.75% respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision was taken due to high global economic uncertainty, especially regarding the direction of US policy and the escalation of geopolitical tensions in various regions. Perry mentioned that this uncertainty is driving the strengthening of the US dollar, with the DXY index having strengthened by +1.2% MTD to the level of 107 as of Wednesday (12/18) following fund flow migration towards that country. Bank Indonesia's decision to maintain the BI Rate is also related to the narrowing room for US interest rate cuts following Trump's victory. Based on the CME FedWatch Tool analysis, the probability of a US interest rate cut of >=75 bps until June 2025 dropped from the level of 62.7% (11/5) before Trump's victory, to 37.1% as of Wednesday (12/18). The above macro developments caused the Rupiah exchange rate to decline against the US Dollar by -1.5% MTD to the level of 16,090. Nevertheless, Perry believes that the current Rupiah exchange rate is still relatively under control and is confident that it will remain stable going forward, in line with Bank Indonesia's commitment to maintaining stability, attractive government bond yields, low inflation, and good economic growth prospects.",
