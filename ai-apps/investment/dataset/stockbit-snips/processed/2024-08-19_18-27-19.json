      "title": "Important Notes on the 2025 State Budget Financial Notes",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance held a press conference regarding the 2025 State Budget Financial Notes on Friday (16/8). Here are some important notes from us: - Subsidy Budget Increased, Positive for Consumption: The budget for energy subsidies and compensation increased by +18% to 394 trillion rupiah, with the highest increase recorded in the electricity subsidy and energy compensation budget. This budget increase, higher than the assumption of currency exchange rate weakening, reflects the government's intention to maintain public purchasing power amidst a global economic slowdown outlook in 2025. Meanwhile, the non-energy subsidy budget and its reserves also increased significantly (+36%), one factor being the addition of the fertilizer subsidy quota from 6-7 million tons to 9 million tons in 2025. - Update on Sweetened Packaged Beverage (MBDK) Excise Duty and Tobacco Product Excise Duty (CHT): The government targets excise revenue in 2025 to increase by +6% to 244 trillion rupiah, partly through limited extension of excise duty on MBDK. The MBDK excise collection itself is targeted to reach 4.4 trillion rupiah in the 2024 APBN, but to date, this excise collection has not been implemented because the government has not yet issued the technical rules. Quantitatively, the estimated negative impact of MBDK excise on the profitability of consumer companies can only be calculated after the government releases the technical regulations for excise calculation. However, qualitatively, we assess that the negative impact of this excise can be minimized because: 1) companies can launch similar less-sugar products; and 2) companies can pass on part of the excise burden into product selling prices. We assess that Mayora Indah ($MYOR) - which has products exposed to MBDK excise amounting to 25-30% of total revenue - potentially feels the biggest impact from the implementation of this excise, followed by Industri Jamu dan Farmasi Sido Muncul ($SIDO) which has an exposure of around 15-20% of revenue. Meanwhile, the government explained that the customs and excise revenue target in the medium term (2025-2029) will be greatly influenced by the tobacco product excise duty (CHT) policy through moderate multiyear tariffs with simplification of tobacco product layers. These two factors were not previously mentioned in the 2024 RAPBN financial notes. - Indication of Free Nutritious Meal Budget ~Rp10,000 per Child per Day: The government confirmed that the budget for the free nutritious meal program has been included in the 2025 RAPBN with a value reaching 71 trillion rupiah, as previously reported. In the initial stage, the recipients of the free nutritious meal program are targeted to reach ~20 million students in underdeveloped areas and areas that already have facility readiness to implement the program. By calculating an initial capex of ~20 trillion rupiah, the free nutritious meal program budget implies an expenditure of ~10,000 thousand rupiah per child per day, according to our calculation. The government estimates that this program will add +0.1 percentage point to 2025 economic growth. - IKN Budget Only Rp143 M (vs. 2024: Rp43 T), but Still Baseline: The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, said that several programs still have relatively small budgets in this transition RAPBN, including for IKN. However, this budget is still a baseline figure that can be added by the next government.",

The strengthening of gold prices occurred along with the weakening of the US dollar index (DXY) by -0.57% on the same day, driven by increasing expectations of the Fed's interest rate cuts and concerns over the escalation of geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. China's national statistics bureau reported that China's coal production in July 2024 grew by +2.8% YoY to 390.37 million tons. Meanwhile, thermal power generation output - which largely uses coal - fell by -4.9% YoY in July 2024 to 574.9 billion kWh, marking a year-on-year decline for 3 consecutive months despite an overall rise in energy consumption. Reuters reported that this result potentially leads to lower import volumes and cheaper prices.",

      "title": "Cabinet Reshuffle and Oil Lifting Focus for Remaining Term",
      "content": "President Joko Widodo inaugurated several ministers and deputy ministers in a cabinet reshuffle on Monday (19/8). Bahlil Lahadalia was appointed as the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) replacing Arifin Tasrif, who was previously nominated by PDIP. Bahlil's former position as the Minister of Investment/Head of the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) was replaced by Rosan Roeslani. President Joko Widodo also appointed Gerindra Party politician, Supratman Andi Agtas, as the Minister of Law and Human Rights to replace PDIP politician, Yasonna Laoly. Additionally, President Joko Widodo appointed Gerindra Party politician and Prabowo-Gibran campaign media director in the 2024 election, Angga Raka Prabowo, as Deputy Minister of Communication and Informatics. The Minister of ESDM, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that he is committed to focusing on increasing oil lifting during his remaining two months in office, until October 2024. The realization of crude oil lifting during 1H24 only reached 576,000 barrels per day, equivalent to only 91% of the 2024 APBN target of 635,000 barrels per day. In the 2025 RAPBN, oil lifting is targeted to reach only 600,000 barrels per day. The Ministry of Finance noted that the government debt position as of the end of July 2024 reached 8,502.69 trillion rupiah, an increase of 57.82 trillion or 0.68% compared to the position at the end of June 2024. Nevertheless, the government debt ratio to gross domestic product (GDP) decreased from 39.13% at the end of June 2024 to 38.68% at the end of July 2024. President Joko Widodo inaugurated Dadan Hindayana as the Head of the National Nutrition Agency. This agency was formed to implement the free nutritious meal program campaigned by the elected president, Prabowo Subianto, which is scheduled to start on January 2, 2025. Dadan is a lecturer at the Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agricultural University. The Secretary-General of the National Awakening Party (PKB), Hasanuddin Wahid, stated that his party is joining the Advanced Indonesia Coalition in the 2024 Jakarta gubernatorial election. This coalition, consisting of 12 parties, officially declared Ridwan Kamil and Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) politician, Suswono, as candidates for Governor and Deputy Governor of Jakarta on Monday (19/8).",
