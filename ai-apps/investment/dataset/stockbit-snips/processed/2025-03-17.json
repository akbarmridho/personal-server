      "title": "Bank Central Asia reports net profit of 4.2 trillion IDR in February 2025",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded net profit (bank only) of 4.2 trillion rupiah in February 2025 (+12% YoY, -10% MoM). This result made the net profit for the first two months of 2025 (2M25) grow 8.4% YoY to 9 trillion rupiah, beating the 2025 consolidated consensus estimate of 7% YoY growth. On the positive side, BBCA reported a decline in credit cost (CoC) in February 2025. On the downside, liquidity tightened and Net Interest Margin (NIM) remained low.\n\n- CoC fell after a high in January 2025: bank‑only CoC dropped to 0.05% in February 2025 (vs. 0.76% in January 2025, 0.57% in February 2024). This recovery brought the 2M25 CoC level down to 0.4% (vs. 0.43% in 2M24), still above the 2025 consolidated guidance of 0.3%.\n- Liquidity tightened, though still ample: bank‑only credit growth slowed to +14% YoY in 2M25 (vs. +15.1% YoY in 1M25 and 2M24). The slowdown aligns with management’s target of consolidated credit growth of 6‑8% YoY for 2025. Meanwhile, third‑party funds (DPK) remained flat at +3.9% YoY in 2M25 (vs. +3.9% YoY in 1M25 and +5.1% YoY in 2M24). This dynamic pushed the Loan‑to‑Deposit Ratio (LDR) back above 80%, reaching 80.6% in 2M25 (vs. 79.7% in 1M25 and 73.5% in 2M24). Although higher LDR is an industry‑wide issue, BBCA still enjoys relatively good liquidity compared with other “Big 4” banks.\n- NIM lowest since February 2024: bank‑only NIM was 5.4% in February 2025 (vs. 5.33% in February 2024, 5.91% in January 2025), the lowest since February 2024. Consequently, 2M25 NIM stood at 5.67% (vs. 5.52% in 2M24), slightly below the 2025 consolidated guidance range of 5.7‑5.8%. Interest income growth was modest at 7.1 trillion rupiah (+4.8% YoY, -7.6% MoM), the main factor behind the low NIM in February 2025. By comparison, annual interest income growth was around 7‑8% YoY in Q4 2024. Nevertheless, Net Interest Income (NII) still grew modestly, reaching +6% YoY in February 2025 and 2M25, supported by low interest expense. Loan yield improvement is part of BBCA’s management intent for the year. Pre‑provision Operating Profit (PPOP) grew +8.6% YoY in 2M25, aided by relatively efficient operating expenses (OPEX) that rose only +3.5% YoY.\n\nKey Takeaway: We assess BBCA’s bank‑only performance in February 2025 as mixed because CoC fell but NIM remained low. However, we believe NIM can recover, driven by potential interest‑rate cuts and a slowdown in credit growth that may improve loan yield through a better loan mix.",
