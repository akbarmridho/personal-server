      "title": "GOTO: Target Adjusted EBITDA Rp1.4-1.6 T in 2025",
      "content": "GoTo Gojek Tokopedia (GOTO) management targets an adjusted EBITDA of approximately 1.4-1.6 trillion rupiah during 2025, with the 'On-Demand Services (ODS)' segment projected to contribute a minimum of 1.1 trillion rupiah and the 'Fintech' segment contributing a minimum of 350 billion rupiah. This target was announced after GOTO recorded a positive adjusted EBITDA* of 399 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: positive 89 billion rupiah, 3Q24: positive 137 billion rupiah). This result brought the adjusted EBITDA for 2024 to a positive 386 billion rupiah (vs. 2023: negative 2.3 trillion rupiah), exceeding the company's guidance which targeted breakeven. On the bottom line, net loss decreased to 1.1 trillion rupiah in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: net loss 80.4 trillion rupiah, 3Q24: net loss 655 billion rupiah), resulting in a net loss for 2024 of 3.1 trillion rupiah (vs. 2023: net loss 87 trillion rupiah). Progress is Projected to Continue in 2025: The 'ODS' segment posted an adjusted EBITDA of positive 267 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (+12% YoY, +71% QoQ) - the highest level ever achieved - driven by revenue growth and improved margins. GOTO management targets the growth of the 'ODS' segment this year to be in line with the industry, which is projected to grow low-mid teens in 2025. GOTO management continues to innovate to support the growth of the ODS segment by relying on its technology - such as the special delivery fleet program which results in more efficient costs, allowing it to offer competitive pricing to customers - and continues to boost advertising revenue (+92% YoY in 4Q24). In the 'Fintech' segment, the amount of financing increased again and stood at 5.2 trillion rupiah as of the end of 2024 (vs. 9M24: 4.3 trillion rupiah, 2023: 1.9 trillion rupiah). GOTO management also targets financing to reach more than 8 trillion rupiah by the end of 2025. Management also explained that asset quality is in quite good condition, without detailing specific metrics. Management explained that the short loan tenor (average of 3 months excluding vehicle financing) allows the company to adapt quickly to changing situations. Corporate Action Update: Regarding buybacks, GOTO management stated that the company has repurchased 23.6 billion shares with a value of approximately 91 million US dollars or 1.5 trillion rupiah as of the end of February 2025. This value indicates an average purchase price of ~64 rupiah per share. For context, GOTO allocated a share buyback budget of 200 million US dollars. Regarding reports of a planned merger with Grab Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: GRAB), management again stated that they could not comment and chose to remain focused on executing strategy, considering the potential market is still large. Finally, regarding the plan to provide holiday allowances (THR) for partners, management explained that THR will be given to productive and high-performing partners. The company will also manage the additional costs within the existing plan. *Note: This is a pro-forma figure assuming the deconsolidation of Tokopedia and related businesses as of January 1, 2023, which we believe provides a better performance comparison. Key Takeaway: With the performance run rate shown in 4Q24, we consider the target adjusted EBITDA of around 1.4-1.6 trillion rupiah during 2025 to be a realistic target to achieve. Risks to achieving the target potentially come from weakening purchasing power, which could lead to increased competition as consumers become more price-sensitive. Meanwhile, potential upside may emerge from increasingly efficient operating costs, thereby increasing margins again.",
