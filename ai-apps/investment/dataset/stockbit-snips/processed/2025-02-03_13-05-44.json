      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on Saturday (Feb 1) announced that he will begin implementing import tariffs of 25% for Canada and Mexico, and additional import tariffs of 10% on top of existing tariffs for China, effective Tuesday (Feb 4). Trump asserted that these tariffs would not be lifted until the flow of narcotics from these three countries to the US stops. More specifically, Trump set import tariffs on oil products from Mexico at 25% and from Canada at 10%. The import tariff for energy products from Canada was set lower after considering concerns from oil refineries in the US and Midwestern states. Trump also indicated that additional oil and gas tariffs would occur in mid-February 2025, without providing further details. Previously, on Thursday (Jan 30), Trump mentioned that his administration had not yet determined whether the planned import tariffs would cover oil and gas commodities. On the other hand, the imposition of import tariffs on China occurred about a week after Trump stated that he could make a fair trade deal with China, despite previously considering import tariffs of 10%. In response, Mexico and Canada - the two largest trading partners of the US - pledged to announce retaliatory tariffs soon. Canada retaliated with 25% tariffs on US imports totaling 155 billion US dollars. Meanwhile, China plans to challenge this policy at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and take other \"retaliatory measures.\" Following this news, the USD Index (DXY) strengthened +1.1% to 109.6 in trading today, Monday (Feb 3), while the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar weakened -0.83% to 16,435. The IHSG closed down -1.11% at 7,030, with the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rising +7 bps to 7.06%. On the other hand, oil prices strengthened, with WTI crude oil in the futures market increasing +3.65% to 75.2 US dollars per barrel today. This increase was caused by concerns over potential disruptions to crude oil supply from the two largest suppliers to the US, while weak demand prospects limited this rise. Meanwhile, gold in the spot market briefly recorded an all-time high at 2,817 US dollars per troy ounce on Friday (Jan 31), driven by safe-haven demand due to concerns about global economic growth and inflationary pressures, despite falling -0.09% to 2,796 per troy ounce today. .png)",

Trump is reportedly scheduled to speak with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday (Feb 3) local time. Meanwhile, Trump also stated that tariffs for the European Union will happen later, and he does not rule out imposing tariffs on the UK. To mitigate volatility risks, investors can take the opportunity to lock in government bond yields (FR), such as PBS003 (2-year tenor) which offers a yield of 6.61% per year. Investors can also consider buying quality stocks that are currently correcting, such as Bank Mandiri ($BMRI) and Bank Central Asia ($BBCA).

Fabby said that donor countries belonging to the International Partners Group have disbursed 230 million US dollars up to December 2024 in the form of grants and technical assistance for 44 programs.
