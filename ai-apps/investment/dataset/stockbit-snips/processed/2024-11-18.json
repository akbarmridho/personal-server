      "title": "Indonesia Trade Balance Surplus Below Expectations",
      "content": "Indonesia's trade balance surplus in October 2024 fell to US$2.48 billion (down 29% year-on-year, down 23% month-on-month), below the consensus estimate of US$3.05 billion. The result ends a streak of 54 consecutive months of surplus.\n\nThe decline was driven by import growth of +18% YoY (versus September 2024 +8.6% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of +7.1% YoY. Export growth was only +10% YoY (versus September 2024 +6.3% YoY), still well above the consensus of +3.8% YoY. Details:\n\n- Non-oil trade surplus fell to US$4.8 billion. Non-oil exports in October 2024 rose to US$23.1 billion (+11% YoY, +10% MoM). Growth was supported by almost all commodity groups, with fats and animal/vegetable oils (+25% YoY) showing the largest increase. By sector, non-oil export growth was driven by non-oil processed industrial products (+14% YoY), especially CPO exports. The main destinations were China (-2% YoY), the United States (+29% YoY) and India (+8% YoY). Non-oil imports amounted to US$18.3 billion (+18% YoY, +12% MoM). Import growth occurred across all major non-oil commodity groups except machinery/equipment and parts. The largest increase was in electrical machinery and parts (+18% YoY). The top supplying countries were China (+20% YoY), Japan (-3.8% YoY) and Singapore (+41% YoY).\n\n- Oil trade deficit reached its largest level in one year at US$2.3 billion (+26% YoY, +69% MoM) in October 2024. The deficit was caused by oil import growth (+14% YoY, +45% MoM) outpacing oil export decline (-1.8% YoY, +17% MoM). The rise in oil imports was driven by higher crude oil imports (+18% YoY) and oil products (+13% YoY).\n\nDuring the first ten months of 2024, the trade surplus totaled US$24.43 billion (-22% YoY), with a non-oil surplus of US$41.8 billion (-11% YoY) and an oil deficit of US$17.4 billion (versus a deficit of US$15.8 billion in the same period of 2023).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIndonesia’s future trade surplus is at risk of further decline due to protectionist policies of the elected President Donald Trump, both directly and indirectly. Direct negative impact may arise from Indonesia-US trade, as the United States accounts for 11% of total Indonesian non-oil gross exports in the first ten months of 2024. Indirect impact may come from a weakened Chinese economy due to the US-China trade war, with China contributing 24% of total Indonesian non-oil gross exports in the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, the growing oil deficit underscores the urgency for Indonesia to boost domestic oil-and-gas production and achieve energy self-sufficiency, a priority of the new administration under President Prabowo Subianto.",

      "title": "ADRO: Dividend Up to US$2.6 Billion",
      "content": "- $ADRO: Shareholders of Adaro Energy Indonesia approved an additional 2023 dividend of up to US$2.6 billion on Monday (18/11). The exact dividend amount has not yet been announced by the extraordinary general meeting. If the maximum amount of US$2.6 billion is distributed, the dividend per share equals IDR 1,359 assuming an exchange rate of USD 1 = IDR 15,898, implying a yield of about 36.7% based on ADRO’s closing price of IDR 3,700 on 18/11. The meeting also approved a change of the company name to Alamtri Resources Indonesia.\n\n- $BUMI: The Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Tri Winarno, said that Bumi Resources has signed a memorandum of understanding with a Chinese company for downstream processing of coal into methanol. Bumi’s corporate secretary, Dileep Srivastava, confirmed the news but could not provide details of the cooperation plan.\n\n- $DSSA: Dian Swastatika Sentosa announced that it has sold 22.5 billion shares (4.72%) of Smartfren Telecom to an affiliate and controlling party of Smartfren, PT Bali Media Telekomunikasi, at IDR 25 per share. The total transaction value is IDR 562 billion. After the sale, DSSA’s ownership in Smartfren falls from 4.72% to 0%. In a separate transaction, DSSA also provided a convertible loan facility of up to US$525 million to PT Bali Media Telekomunikasi with a three-year term.\n\n- $INTP: Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa reported a 10% year-on-year increase in cement sales volume in October 2024 (including Grobogan Cement), raising its market share to 28.5% from 25.9% in October 2023, while the industry-wide volume grew only 0.2%. The growth was driven by Java Island (+13% YoY), especially Central Java (+55% YoY) due to the consolidation of Grobogan Cement. Management believes October 2024 will be the highest sales month of the year as construction slows because of regional elections and the rainy season. Bag-in-bag cement sales grew 2.6% YoY and bulk cement grew 30% YoY. For the first ten months of 2024, INTP’s sales volume increased 9.6% to 15.5 million tonnes.\n\n- $GJTL: Gajah Tunggal obtained a syndicated credit facility of IDR 4.4 trillion, consisting of two tranches with tenors of eight and nine years respectively. The funds will be used for refinancing and to finance the expansion of the company’s production facilities.\n\n- $HEAL: Medikaloka Hermina director Yulisar Khiat purchased 1 million HEAL shares at an average price of IDR 1,432.5 per share on 6 November 2024, totaling approximately IDR 1.4 billion.

Trump has previously planned to raise tariffs on Chinese products to 60%.\n\n- The Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, ordered eight state-owned companies to implement a free nutritious meals program. The companies include Bank Rakyat Indonesia ($BBRI), Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI), Bank Mandiri ($BMRI), Telkom Indonesia ($TLKM), Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS), PT PLN, ID Survey, and the Pupuk Indonesia holding.\n\n- Kontan reported that Shell Indonesia plans to close all its publicly accessible fuel stations in Indonesia. Shell has already closed nine stations in Medan and currently operates 215 stations nationwide. Moshe Rizal, chairman of the Investment Committee of the Indonesian Oil and Gas Companies Association (Aspermigas), said competition from private-sector fuel stations is tough because they must compete with Pertamina, which controls more than 90% of the domestic fuel market. Shell’s President Corporate Relations, Susi Hutapea, explained that the Medan closures are part of Shell’s global strategy to create a lower-emission business.\n\n- Deputy Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Dida Gardera said the government may review the export levy on crude palm oil (CPO) every three to six months to maintain competitiveness against rival vegetable oils, but may also choose not to change the policy. The last revision of the CPO export levy was in September 2024.\n\n- Agung Podomoro Land ($APLN) through its subsidiary PT Putra Adhi Prima announced the sale of assets consisting of land and buildings related to the Pullman Ciawi Vimala Hills Resort Spa & Convention and other land parcels to PT Bangun Loka Indah.
