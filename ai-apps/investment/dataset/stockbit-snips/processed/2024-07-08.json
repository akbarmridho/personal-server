      "title": "US Job Growth Slows, Expectations of Fed Rate Cuts Rise",
      "content": "US job growth slowed in June 2024. Non‑farm payrolls fell to 206,000 jobs, down from the revised May 2024 level of 218,000, yet still above the consensus expectation of 190,000. The April 2024 non‑farm payroll figure was revised down by 57,000 to 108,000 jobs, and the May figure was revised down by 54,000, indicating that the US labour market is not as strong as previously thought. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June (versus 4.0% in May), above the consensus forecast of 4.0% and marking the highest level since November 2021.\n\nFollowing the data release, the three major US equity indices rose on Friday (5 July): the Dow Jones increased by 0.17%, the S&P 500 rose 0.54%, and the Nasdaq gained 0.9%. The 10‑year US Treasury yield fell 6.9 basis points to 4.278%, while the US dollar index (DXY) slipped 0.24% to 104.88.\n\nThe slowdown in US job absorption lifted market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September 2024 to 68.2% on Monday (8 July), according to the CME FedWatch Tool, up from 59.8% on 1 July 2024.\n\nIn Indonesia, the rupiah appreciated 0.3% to 16,265 per US dollar on Monday (8 July). The 10‑year Indonesian government bond yield fell 3.6 basis points to 7.03%. The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) was essentially flat, slipping 0.03%.\n\nKey Takeaway: The slight dip in the IHSG on Monday (8 July) does not reflect a weakening risk appetite, as the number of advancing stocks (318) outnumbered decliners (256) and unchanged stocks (223), and most sectoral indices were positive. Optimism was also evident from the strong gains in cyclical sectors such as property, technology, and construction.",
