The result lifted 2024 net profit to 1.45 trillion rupiah (+23% YoY), matching the Stockbit 2024F estimate (100%).

Excluding currency and non-recurring items, core profit was 244 billion rupiah (-20% YoY, -42% QoQ). Core profit for 2024 grew 48% YoY to 1.34 trillion rupiah, in line with the 99% Stockbit estimate. Opex rose to 1.09 trillion rupiah (+14% YoY, +32% QoQ) due to higher salary and compensation costs. Sales reached 3.5 trillion rupiah (+4% YoY, +4% QoQ) with the Farmasi segment up 10% YoY and Consumer & Cosmetics up 11% YoY; both segments grew 17% and 11% YoY in 2024.
