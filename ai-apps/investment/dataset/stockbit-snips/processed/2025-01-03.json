      "title": "Indonesia Consumer Price Index (CPI) 1.57% YoY in 2024, Lowest Since Record",
      "content": "Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 1.57 percent year-on-year in December 2024, according to the Statistics Agency (BPS). This was down from 1.55 percent YoY in November 2024 and below the consensus forecast of 1.6 percent YoY, marking the lowest calendar-year inflation since BPS began publishing inflation data in 1958. The realization is within the lower bound of Bank Indonesia’s target range of 1.5-3.5 percent.\n\nThe low annual inflation in 2024 was driven by price declines in several commodities, including red chili, bird’s eye chili, green chili, gasoline, air-transport fares, and mobile telephone services. Core inflation in December 2024 was 2.26 percent YoY, also lower than the consensus expectation of 2.28 percent YoY.\n\nOn a month-to-month basis, Indonesia recorded CPI inflation of 0.44 percent in December 2024, up from 0.30 percent in November 2024, matching expectations and representing the highest monthly increase in the past nine months. The monthly rise was led by the food, beverage and tobacco group, which posted 1.33 percent MoM inflation, contributing 0.38 percentage point to the overall CPI. Core CPI rose 0.17 percent MoM, unchanged from November 2024.\n\nOn the same day the inflation data were released, S&P Global reported that Indonesia’s manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in December 2024, up from 49.6 in November 2024, indicating the first expansionary reading since June 2024 as output grew moderately.\n\nIndustrial Ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif said that the introduction of a 12 percent value-added tax (VAT) in January 2025 prompted manufacturers to increase orders for inventory, helping the manufacturing PMI to enter expansion territory. He added that firms were trying to take advantage of the window before the VAT increase, although the government later revised the regulation to apply only to luxury goods.",
