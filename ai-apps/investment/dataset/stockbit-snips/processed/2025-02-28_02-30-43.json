      "title": "Signal from State-Owned Banks Mandated to Fund 3 Million Housing Program",
      "content": "The Head of the Housing Task Force, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, the brother of President Prabowo Subianto, on Wednesday (2/26) signaled that the government will mandate the group of state-owned banks (Himbara) to provide financing for the planned program to construct 3 million houses per year. Hashim stated that he heard there would be an order for Himbara to support this program, with related regulations currently under discussion among decision-makers. Hashim's statement followed the request by the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, in the middle of this month, asking for an active role from Himbara to support the program to build 3 million houses per year. Besides Himbara, Erick also hoped private banks could support this program. One of the state-owned banks that has shown its readiness to support the program is Bank Tabungan Negara ($BBTN), with BBTN President Director, Nixon L. P. Napitupulu, stating in December 2024 that his party plans to issue bonds of approximately 10-15 trillion rupiah during 2025 to fulfill the addition of liquidity facilities for housing financing (FLPP). Nixon mentioned that the government plans to increase the FLPP quota from 220,000 housing units in 2024 to 800,000 housing units in 2025, requiring a budget of 80 trillion rupiah. It should be noted that FLPP is not only implemented by BBTN. In 2025 itself, the State Budget (APBN) allocates 18 trillion rupiah for FLPP liquidity assistance and injects working capital to PT Sarana Multigriya Finansial to channel 220,000 subsidized mortgages (KPR) with an interest rate of 5% for a 20-year tenor. Most recently, a member of the Housing Task Force, Bonny Z. Minang, stated on Thursday (2/27) that the 2025 FLPP quota has been increased to 420,000 units, with additional budget funds to be disbursed gradually. The discourse on Himbara's involvement in the 3 million houses per year program emerged amidst government efforts to increase FLPP subsidies on a larger scale through the issuance of government bonds. Although the amount of debt securities to be issued is not yet known, Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated last week that Bank Indonesia would purchase these bonds on the secondary market. Hashim claimed that Bank Indonesia has agreed to provide 130 trillion rupiah to support the program to build 3 million houses per year, although he did not specify the exact scheme Bank Indonesia will use to provide this support. Bank Indonesia previously announced an increase in the amount of KLM incentives in the housing sector - including public housing - gradually starting April 1, 2025, from 23 trillion rupiah to approximately 80 trillion rupiah. Hashim mentioned that the 3 million houses per year construction project will commence in April 2025, coinciding with the realization of an investment of about 18-20 billion US dollars from Qatari investors, Qilaa International Group. Key Takeaway: If mandated, we see that banks belonging to Himbara potentially face uncertainty regarding margins and asset quality from financing this program, especially for BBRI, BMRI, and BBNI which have not historically focused on public housing financing like BBTN. The potential margin depends on several factors such as financing interest rates, funding schemes, and cost of funds. Meanwhile, asset quality will be influenced by factors like financing schemes, tenor, and selectivity of borrower criteria. In our view, generally, this uncertainty could create negative sentiment, at least in the short term. In today's trading, Thursday (2/27), $BMRI weakened -5.28%, followed by $BBRI -4.97%, $BBTN -0.56%, and $BBNI -0.23%.",

      "title": "US President Donald Trump Implements Import Tariffs and Leaves Market Confused on Scope and Timing",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, stated on Wednesday (2/26) that he plans to impose a 25% import tariff on the European Union in the near future, although he did not provide further details. Trump mentioned that the tariff for the European Union would be imposed on imports of cars and all other things. It is still unknown whether the import tariff for the European Union is part of a number of previously discussed plans for tariffs on specific commodities or a separate policy targeting all products from the bloc. Previously, Trump also planned to impose a 25% tariff on imports of cars, medicines, semiconductors, and timber. Bloomberg reported that US President, Donald Trump, made contradictory and confusing statements on Wednesday (2/26) regarding the deadline and scope of several planned import tariff implementations. For example, Trump mentioned that import tariffs for Canada and Mexico would be effective starting March 4, 2025, before later stating April 2, 2025, which is the date the US Department of Commerce was supposed to announce the results of a study on reciprocal tariffs for countries hindering US trade. Bloomberg mentioned that it is unknown whether Trump will postpone the import tariffs for Canada and Mexico again or if he conflated the deadlines with other tariff plans. It is also unclear whether the tariffs for Canada and Mexico are part of the reciprocal tariff plan or a separate policy. The Head of the Legal Information Center of the Attorney General's Office, Harli Siregar, clarified on Wednesday (2/26) that the state loss of 193.7 trillion rupiah from the corruption case concerning the governance of crude oil and refinery products within the subsidiaries of PT Pertamina is an estimate for 2023 only. Therefore, Harli stated that the total loss from the corruption case occurring between 2018-2023 might still increase along with more in-depth calculation processes. Most recently, the Attorney General's Office named Maya Kusmaya (Director of PT Pertamina Patra Niaga) and Edward Corne (VP Trading of Products at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga) as new suspects in the corruption case, bringing the total number of suspects to 9 people. The Director of Investigation at the Attorney General's Office, Abdul Qohar, stated that Maya allegedly ordered Edward to blend RON 88 with RON 92 to produce RON 92 fuel products. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Wednesday (2/26) that the government will ban crude oil exports and shorten the BBM import permit period from 1 year to 6 months, following the emergence of corruption cases within PT Pertamina subsidiaries which led to the 'adulterated Pertamax' scandal. The government will set the Reference Coal Price (HBA) 2 times a month, on the 1st and 15th, to reflect more up-to-date price conditions when used as a price reference for exporters, based on a briefing from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on Wednesday (2/26). Currently, the HBA setting is only conducted once a month. The government itself will start mandating the HBA as an export reference price for coal starting March 1, 2025. Exporters are still permitted to use the price listed in their ongoing long-term contracts with buyers, but the government expects companies to make adjustments if their contracts allow it. The advisor and brother of President Prabowo Subianto, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, stated on Wednesday (2/26) that the government ensures there will be no tax increases, with efforts to increase state revenue being carried out by optimizing revenue from the shadow economy activities. Hashim, as a businessman, admitted that he wants the corporate income tax rate or PPh Badan to decrease from 22% to 18%, a desire he conveyed directly to the Deputy Minister of Finance, Anggito Abimanyu, on the same occasion. Previously, President Prabowo promised during his election campaign to raise the state revenue ratio to 23% of GDP, much higher than the 2025 APBN target of around 12% of GDP. President Prabowo Subianto secured plans for the establishment of the State Revenue Agency through Presidential Regulation Number 12/2025 concerning the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) for the 2025-2029 period. This agency is intended to boost the state revenue ratio to the 23% of GDP level. The establishment of the State Revenue Agency was one of President Prabowo's campaign promises but was canceled following Sri Mulyani's return as Minister of Finance. The advisor and brother of President Prabowo Subianto, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, stated on Wednesday (2/26) that the government plans to achieve budget efficiency of around 20 billion US dollars or approximately 328 trillion rupiah every year, where the funds resulting from budget cuts will most likely be invested in the Danantara Investment Management Agency. Previously, President Prabowo mentioned that the government would allocate initial funds to Danantara amounting to 20 billion US dollars from this year's budget efficiency savings. Petrosea ($PTRO) signed a mining services contract worth approximately 4 trillion rupiah from PT Bara Prima Mandiri and PT Niaga Jasa Dunia, both non-affiliated companies. The contract is a follow-up to the term sheet announced in November 2024. The contract duration will last until December 31, 2032, with estimated overburden production reaching ~135.5 million bcm and coal production of ~7.5 million tons.",
