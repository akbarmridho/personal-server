      "title": "Signal from Himbara to Provide Funding for 3 Million-House Program",
      "content": "On Wednesday, February 26, the Chairman of the Housing Task Force and younger brother of President Prabowo Subianto, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, signaled that the government will require the state-owned banks (Himbara) to provide financing for the 3-million-house-per-year construction program planned by the government. He said he heard there will be an order for Himbara to support the program, with related regulations currently under discussion among decision-making officials. The statement followed Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Erick Thohir’s request earlier this month for Himbara to play an active role, and he also hopes private banks will support the program. State-owned Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) announced that its President Director Nixon L. P. Napitupulu said in December 2024 that the bank plans to issue bonds worth around IDR 10-15 trillion in 2025 to meet the increased liquidity financing facilities for housing (FLPP). The government plans to raise the FLPP quota from 220,000 units in 2024 to 800,000 units in 2025, requiring a budget of IDR 80 trillion. The 2025 state budget allocates IDR 18 trillion for FLPP liquidity and injects working capital to PT Sarana Multigriya Finansial to channel 220,000 mortgages at a 5% loan rate for a 20-year tenor. On Thursday, February 27, Housing Task Force member Bonny Z. Minang said the 2025 FLPP quota was increased to 420,000, with the additional budget to be disbursed gradually. The Himbara involvement discussion comes as the government seeks to expand FLPP subsidies via government bond issuance. Although the amount of bonds to be issued is unknown, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said last week that Bank Indonesia will purchase the bonds in the secondary market. Hashim claimed that Bank Indonesia has agreed to provide IDR 130 trillion to support the 3-million-house program, though he did not detail the scheme. Bank Indonesia previously announced a step-up of housing-related KLM incentives from IDR 23 trillion to about IDR 80 trillion effective 1 April 2025. Hashim said the 3-million-house project will start in April 2025, coinciding with an investment of US$18-20 billion from Qatar’s Qilaa International Group.",

Margin uncertainty will depend on financing rates, funding schemes, and cost of funds, while asset quality will be affected by financing scheme, tenor, and borrower selection criteria. Overall, the uncertainty could generate short-term negative sentiment.",
