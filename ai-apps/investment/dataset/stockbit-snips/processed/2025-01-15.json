      "title": "BI Rate Cut by 25 Basis Points, Outside Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia reduced the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% on Wednesday (15/1), with the deposit facility and lending facility also each falling 25 basis points to 5% and 6.5% respectively. The decision was outside the consensus, which had expected the BI Rate to be held at 6%. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the move considered a balance between rupiah exchange-rate stability and Indonesia’s economic growth. The central bank also cut its 2025 growth outlook from a range of +4.8-5.6% YoY to +4.7-5.5% YoY due to weaker consumption, employment, investment and exports. For 4Q24, the bank projects growth of only +5-5.1% YoY. Inflation for 2025-2026 is expected to stay low at 1.5-3.5% YoY (versus 2024 inflation of 1.57% YoY). The rate cut comes amid a weakening rupiah against the US dollar over recent months, driven by geopolitical uncertainty, the new US administration’s policy direction and a higher-for-longer US rate narrative. The central bank also lowered its expectation for the Fed’s 2025 rate cuts from –50 bps (as of November 2024) to –25 bps, reflecting possible slower disinflation because of higher import duties proposed by the newly elected US President Donald Trump. This expectation aligns with market expectations shown by the CME Fedwatch Tool on Wednesday (15/1). Perry said clearer policy direction from Trump and the Fed will help calm global volatility.\n\nTo preserve rupiah stability, Bank Indonesia will continue interventions in the bond market, spot, and domestic non-deliverable forwards, and will optimise the Rupiah Securities (SRBI), Foreign-Currency Sukuk (SUVBI) and Foreign-Currency Securities (SVBI). The central bank is preparing SUVBI and SVBI as additional incentive instruments for foreign-exchange proceeds from natural-resource exports (DHE SDA), alongside existing tools such as foreign-currency term deposits and FX swaps. Previously, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said the government will revise the minimum placement tenor for DHE SDA from three months to one year, aiming to boost domestic foreign-exchange supplies and ease pressure on the rupiah.",

      "content": "Following the BI Rate cut, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rose 1.77% at market close, while the rupiah weakened 0.3% to 16,320 per US dollar and the 10-year government bond yield fell 0.4 basis points to 7.272%. The market welcomed the unexpected decision, recording a net foreign inflow of IDR 580 billion—the first inflow since 9 January 2025. Interest-sensitive sectors such as banking (+3.12%) and property (+2.63%) posted strong gains.\n\n- Banking: BBRI (+7.63%), BBNI (+6.78%), BMRI (+6.48%), BBCA (+2.89%)\n- Property: CTRA (+7.87%), PWON (+5.26%), BSDE (+5.03%), SMRA (+3.57%)\n\nInvestors should watch the US inflation data due on Wednesday (15/1), which could add further pressure on the rupiah.",
