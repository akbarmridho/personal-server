The Constitutional Court on Tuesday (29/4) decided to prohibit \"the government, companies, institutions, or groups with certain identities\" from filing defamation complaints against an individual. This decision was made after environmental activists sued articles in the ITE Law which they considered threatening freedom of expression.2. Mastersystem Infotama ($MSTI) recorded a net profit of 115 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (+10% YoY, -47% QoQ), in line with our expectations as it is equivalent to 19% of Stockbit's 2025F estimate (vs. 1Q24: 20% realization of 2024 net profit). The annual net profit growth in 1Q25 was mainly driven by an increase in operating profit and a rise in net interest income to 9 billion rupiah (vs. 1Q24: 2 billion rupiah, 4Q24: 2 billion rupiah). Operating profit in 1Q25 grew +8% YoY to 135 billion rupiah, driven by a revenue increase of +6% YoY to 1.2 trillion rupiah.3. Ramayana Lestari Sentosa ($RALS) recorded a net profit of 218 billion rupiah in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 107 billion rupiah, 4Q24: 61 billion rupiah). This increase was driven by the shift in Lebaran seasonality, considering that net profit in 1Q24 and 1Q23 was only equivalent to 34% and 10% of the total net profit for that year. Revenue in 1Q25 surged to 1.1 trillion rupiah (+38% YoY, +77% QoQ), with operating profit rising to 241 billion rupiah (vs. 1Q24: 106 billion rupiah, 4Q24: 49 billion rupiah) accompanied by an expansion of the operating profit margin to 21% (vs. 1Q24: 12.7%, 4Q24: 7.5%).4. Amman Mineral Indonesia ($AMMN) plans to conduct a buyback of up to 0.17% of shares with a fund allocation of up to 50 million US dollars or 835 billion rupiah from April 30 to July 31, 2025. This plan does not require EGMS approval, following the relaxation provided by the OJK to support capital market stability.5. Shareholders of Raharja Energi Cepu ($RATU) on Wednesday (30/4) approved the plan to distribute 2024 fiscal year dividends amounting to approximately 109 billion rupiah or 40 rupiah per share, equivalent to a ~46% dividend payout ratio and indicating a dividend yield of 0.7% as of Wednesday (30/4). The cum date for the regular and negotiation markets is May 8, 2025, with payment on June 4, 2025. $RATU shareholders also approved the appointment of Adrian Hartadi as director and Merly as commissioner. For context, Merly is a director at Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN), while Adrian also serves as general manager at PT Chandra Daya Investasi, a subsidiary of Chandra Asri Pacific ($TPIA).6. ABM Investama ($ABMM) will distribute 2024 fiscal year dividends amounting to 421 billion rupiah or 153 rupiah per share, equivalent to an 18% dividend payout ratio and indicating a dividend yield of 4.6% as of Wednesday (30/4). The cum date for the regular and negotiation markets is May 6, 2025, while payment is on May 28, 2025.7. Pembangunan Jaya Ancol ($PJAA) will distribute 2024 fiscal year dividends amounting to 38 billion rupiah or 24 rupiah per share, equivalent to a 22% dividend payout ratio and indicating a dividend yield of 4.8% as of Wednesday (30/4). The cum date for the regular and negotiation markets is May 6, 2025, while payment is on May 28, 2025.8. Bank Danamon ($BDMN) announced a merger plan between its subsidiary, Adira Dinamika Multi Finance ($ADMF), and Mandala Multifinance ($MFIN). This corporate action is targeted to be completed by October 1, 2025, and $ADMF will be the surviving entity. Based on the assessment by a public appraisal service office, the ratio between the market value of $ADMF and $MFIN shares is 1:0.052401, where every 1 $MFIN share is equivalent to 0.052401 $ADMF shares. After the merger, $BDMN shareholders will hold (74.5%) and MUFG (18.9%) in $ADMF. This plan will be discussed in the respective issuers' EGMS on June 30, 2025.9. Selamat Sempurna ($SMSM) will distribute an interim dividend for the 2025 fiscal year amounting to 144 billion rupiah or 25 rupiah per share, indicating a dividend yield of 1.4% as of Wednesday (30/4). The cum date for the regular and negotiation markets is May 8, 2025, while payment is on May 27, 2025.",

As a reminder, $BBRI management in January 2025 decided to add provisions (management overlay) with the bank-only CoC rising up to 5.6% in that month. NPL increased from the end of 2024 to 3% in 1Q25, although it was lower annually (vs. 2024: 2.8%, 1Q24: 3.1%). This NPL increase mainly occurred in the micro segment which rose to 3.4% (vs. 2024: 2.9%, 1Q24: 2.7%). The overhaul currently being undertaken by the new management in the micro segment is making micro credit distribution tighter, reflected in a -3% YoY decrease in bank-only micro segment credit in 1Q25 (vs. 2024: -1% YoY). On a consolidated basis, credit for the micro and ultra-micro segments still grew +2% YoY in 1Q25, driven entirely by financing growth from Pegadaian (+30% YoY) and PNM (+5% YoY).",

      "content": "Low-cost funds (CASA) grew +7% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 2024: +5% YoY), while total deposits were flat (+0.4% YoY). The increase in CASA growth caused the Cost of Fund (CoF) to drop to 3.5% (vs. 2024: 3.7%, 1Q24: 3.6%). However, the improvement in CoF was unable to boost NIM which consolidated down to 7.7% in 1Q25 (vs. 2024: 7.8%, 1Q24: 8%) due to a decrease in lending yield to 12.9% (vs. 2024: 13.3%, 1Q24: 13.6%). Besides the micro segment overhaul, strengthening the funding franchise is also one of the new management's priorities, so positive CASA growth momentum is expected to continue. From a liquidity aspect, the challenges faced by $BBRI are relatively lighter compared to Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) and Bank Mandiri (($BMRI)), considering that credit growth is not $BBRI's main focus at the moment. LDR stood at 86% in 1Q25 (vs. 2024: 88.9%) along with relatively low credit growth at +5% YoY.",

Regarding global tariff risks, BBRI mentioned that the direct exposure from clients exporting to the US reaches approximately 20 trillion rupiah, equivalent to about 1.5% of total credit. However, indirect risks potentially come from the weakening of the Indonesian economy which has a greater correlation with the MSME segment. We assess that the progress of asset quality improvement in the micro segment will remain a key factor for investors to watch, where asset quality improvement will allow this segment to grow again in the future.",
