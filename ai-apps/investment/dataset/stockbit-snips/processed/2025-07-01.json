      "title": "Inflation and Trade Balance Surplus Exceed Expectations",
      "content": "BPS recorded that Indonesia's inflation in June 2025 was 1.87% year-on-year (YoY), compared with 1.6% YoY in May 2025 and 2.51% YoY in June 2024, slightly above the consensus expectation of 1.83% YoY while still within Bank Indonesia's target range of 1.5-3.5%. On an annual basis, inflation was driven by the 'personal care and other services' group contributing 0.59 percentage points, of which 0.48 percentage points came from gold jewelry commodities. The 'food, beverages and tobacco' group contributed 0.58 percentage points to annual inflation in June 2025. On a monthly basis, Indonesia recorded 0.19% month-on-month (MoM) inflation in June 2025 (versus a deflation of 0.37% MoM in May 2025 and a deflation of 0.08% MoM in June 2024). Core inflation eased to 2.37% YoY in June 2025 (versus 2.4% YoY in May 2025 and 1.9% YoY in June 2024), slightly below the consensus forecast of 2.44% YoY. In addition to inflation, BPS also recorded that Indonesia's trade-balance surplus reached USD 4.3 billion in May 2025 (versus USD 158.8 million in April 2025 and USD 2.9 billion in May 2024), surpassing the consensus estimate of a USD 2.4 billion surplus. The result was driven by export growth of +9.68% YoY in May 2025, far exceeding the consensus expectation of +1% YoY. Imports in May 2025 grew +4.14% YoY, also above the consensus expectation of –0.1% YoY. Cumulatively over the first five months of 2025 (5M25), the trade balance posted a surplus of USD 15.38 billion. Export growth over 5M25 was +6.98% YoY, mainly driven by a +33.1% YoY increase in the 'fat and animal/vegetable oil' (CPO) group. Import growth over 5M25 was more moderate at +5.45% YoY, largely constrained by a –11.75% YoY decline in crude oil imports. Key Takeaway: The low inflation figure and supportive trade-balance surplus for the rupiah exchange rate could give Bank Indonesia more room to cut interest rates. Bloomberg consensus expects the central bank to lower the policy rate by another 50 basis points to 5% by the end of 2025.",

      "content": "1. The government officially issued nine new import regulations as part of deregulation to strengthen the national economy. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday (30 June) that there are changes to the prohibition and restriction policies for ten major commodities. Trade Minister Budi Santoso said he has signed nine regulations covering several clusters, namely Trade Minister Regulations No. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 of 2025.\n2. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the 2025 state budget deficit is projected to reach 2.78% of GDP, higher than the 2025 APBN target of 2.53% of GDP and potentially the largest deficit in two decades (excluding the pandemic), though still below the 3% legal limit. In the first half of 2025, the deficit reached 0.81% of GDP (vs. 0.34% in H1 2024). This projection comes a few days after Sri Mulyani last week said the government remains committed to fiscal discipline and expects the 2025 deficit to be 2.5% of GDP.\n3. Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara is seeking a multi-currency loan of up to USD 10 billion for general corporate purposes, potentially the largest loan in Southeast Asia. Bloomberg sources said Danantara has submitted proposals to regional and international banks for a loan with a tenor of about 3-5 years. Danantara has not commented on Bloomberg's report. In a separate report, Kontan reported that Danantara is projected to obtain USD 10 billion of funding from foreign banks in July 2025.\n4. Director General of Land Transportation, Aan Suhanan, said the ministry will raise online motorbike-taxi (ojol) fares by about 8-15% per kilometre, depending on zoning. The increase still requires approval from the operators. The fare hike is a response to driver complaints about earnings not matching operating costs.\n5. Bloomberg reported that China will continue anti-dumping duties on stainless-steel imports for the next five years, including from Indonesia. The measure, in place since July 2019, aims to protect Chinese industry from oversupply and global trade uncertainty. The anti-dumping duty on Indonesian stainless steel remains at 20.2%, while the EU and UK impose 43%, and many South Korean firms face 103.1%.\n6. S&P Global recorded that Indonesia's manufacturing PMI fell to 46.9 in June 2025 (vs. 47.4 in May 2025), indicating a three-month contraction in factory activity, driven by a three-month decline in new orders, the sharpest drop since August 2021. S&P Global also recorded that China's manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4 in June 2025 (vs. 48.3 in May 2025), surpassing the consensus level of 49, supported by output growth at the fastest pace since November 2024 as new orders increased amid improving trade conditions and promotional activities.\n7. BPS recorded that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia reached approximately 1.3 million in May 2025 (up 14% YoY, up 12% MoM). This brings total foreign arrivals to about 5.6 million over the first five months of 2025 (up 7.4% YoY), representing 35-40% of the government's 2025 target of 14-16 million visitors.",

The target reflects a weaker macro-economic environment in Indonesia compared with the previous year. MAPI plans a capital expenditure of IDR 2 trillion in 2025 for expansion, including the opening of 40 new Starbucks stores through MAP Boga Adiperkasa (MAPB).
