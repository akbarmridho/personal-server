      "title": "The Fed Cuts Interest Rate by 25 Basis Points, As Expected",
      "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve decided to cut the policy interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.5-4.75%, matching the consensus expectation. This decision follows a previous cut of 50 basis points at the September 2024 meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the rate is on a path toward a neutral level that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy. He expressed confidence that inflation can gradually ease to the 2% target in a sustainable manner, while the labor market remains healthy though generally cooling. Powell also stated that the outcome of the U.S. presidential election will not affect monetary policy in the short term. The elected president, Donald Trump, previously affirmed that he will allow Powell to continue his term until May 2026 and that Powell would not resign if asked by Trump. Based on the September 2024 dot-plot projection, Fed officials anticipate another 25-basis-point cut by the end of 2024 and a further 100-basis-point reduction during 2025. The Fed will update its dot-plot at the December 2024 meeting. Meanwhile, the market still expects an additional 25-basis-point cut in December, with the probability decreasing slightly from 82.7% to 74.7% after Trump’s victory. In response, the three major U.S. stock indices closed higher on Thursday (7 Nov): the S&P 500 rose 0.74%, the Nasdaq jumped 1.51%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at –0%. Earlier, the indices had broken all-time highs after Trump’s election win on Wednesday (6 Nov). The U.S. dollar index (DXY) weakened 0.55% to 104.5 on Thursday.",

      "content": "China approved a stimulus package of 6 trillion yuan (approximately 839 billion USD) to help local governments refinance debt. The stimulus will be implemented over three years until 2026, with an annual allocation of 2 trillion yuan. Additionally, the Chinese government raised the ceiling for special local government bonds from 29.52 trillion yuan (4.12 billion USD) to 35.52 trillion yuan (4.96 billion USD). Gaikindo Chairman Yohannes Nangoi said the association targets national automobile wholesale sales of 1 million units in 2025, optimistic that sales can return to that level as interest rates fall and electric vehicle charging infrastructure expands beyond Java-Bali. Previously, Gaikindo downgraded the 2024 wholesale sales target from 1.1 million units to 850,000 units, a 15.5% reduction, after actual sales fell 16.2% year-on-year to 633,218 units in the first nine months of 2024. The Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, proposed extending the mortgage loan (KPR) tenor from 15 years to 30 years to make monthly payments more affordable. The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, inaugurated Djoko Siswanto as the new head of SKK Migas, replacing Dwi Soetjipto. Bahlil emphasized that the new head should increase oil and gas lifting to achieve the energy sovereignty vision of President Prabowo Subianto, urging coordination with contractors to optimize idle wells. Lifting in the first half of 2024 reached 576.11 thousand barrels of oil per day (90.73% of the 2024 APBN target) and 946.61 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day of gas (91.64% of the target). The launch of the Danantara Investment Management Fund (BPI Danantara) was postponed until President Prabowo returns from overseas, awaiting finalization of government and presidential regulations. President Prabowo wants the launch to proceed cautiously. The government will transfer seven state-owned enterprises—Bank Mandiri, Bank Rakyat Indonesia, Bank Negara Indonesia, Telkom Indonesia, PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, PT Pertamina, and PT Mineral Industri Indonesia (MIND ID)—to BPI Danantara. The controlling shareholder of PEVE, PT Tancorp Mega Buana, bought 423.8 million (24%) PEVE shares from PT Maramakmur Selaras and PT Multi Pidotama Mandiri at IDR 265 per share on 7 Nov, raising its ownership from 56% to 80% (transaction value 112.3 billion IDR). KMD S will distribute an interim dividend of 15 IDR per share for FY 2024, amounting to 12 billion IDR, with a dividend yield of 2.19% based on a closing price of 685 IDR. Segar Kumala Indonesia (BUAH) CEO Renny Lauren bought 732,600 shares at an average price of 1,600 IDR per share on 6 Nov, investing about 1.2 billion IDR and increasing his stake from 0.97% to 1.05%.",
