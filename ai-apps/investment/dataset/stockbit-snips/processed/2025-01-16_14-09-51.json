      "title": "US Core Inflation Below Expectations, Rate Cut Hopes Increase",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday (1/15) local time announced that US core inflation eased on an annual basis in December 2024 and was below expectations, although headline inflation increased. Here are the details: YoY Inflation: 2.9% (vs. consensus: 2.9%; Nov 2024: 2.7%) MoM Inflation: 0.4% (vs. consensus: 0.3%; Nov 2024: 0.3%) Core Inflation YoY: 3.2% (vs. consensus: 3.3%; Nov 2024: 3.3%) Core Inflation MoM: 0.2% (vs. consensus: 0.2%; Nov 2024: 0.3%). The development above reopens market participants' hopes for a greater prospect of US interest rate cuts. Before this data release, the market tended to be pessimistic along with the higher-for-longer narrative, with the Fed only expected to cut interest rates by 25 bps this year. According to analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool as of Thursday (16/1), the probability of the Fed cutting US interest rates by more than 25 bps in 2025 rose to 45%, from the previous level of 34.8% on January 14, 2025. Following the inflation data release, the US stock markets closed stronger on Wednesday (15/1), with DJI +1.6%, S&P 500 +1.8%, and Nasdaq +2.4%. On the same day, the US dollar index (DXY) fell -0.16% to 109.1 and the 10-year US government bond yield fell -14 bps to 4.653%. In Indonesia, the IHSG closed stronger +0.39% on Thursday (16/1), while the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield fell -9 bps to 7.172% and the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened -0.24% to 16,360. The Head of the Monetary Management and Asset Management Department of Bank Indonesia, Edi Susianto, stated that the weakening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar is still under control. Edi mentioned that the Rupiah weakening is short-term because market participants are still digesting Bank Indonesia's decision to cut the BI Rate by -25 bps to 5.75% yesterday, Wednesday (15/1). Key Takeaway Although the increase in The Fed's rate cut expectations is fresh air for Indonesia, we assess that the market will still tend to be volatile until further clarity emerges regarding the new US government policy which has the potential to influence interest rate direction. Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated as the US President on January 20, 2024, local time. Meanwhile, the nearest Fed meeting schedule will take place on January 28-29, 2024, local time. To face volatility from the rate narrative that can change at any time, investors can lock in high short-term FR bond yields which still have low volatility, such as PBS003 (maturing in 2 years) offering a yield of 6.79% per year. *This article was first published in Stockbit Commentary on Thursday (16/1) morning.",
