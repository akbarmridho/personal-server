      "content": "1. The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday (4/23) reported that the US government is considering cutting import tariffs from China in an effort to de-escalate tensions. Anonymous officials at the White House told the Wall Street Journal that tariffs on China could drop from the current level of 145% to a range of 50-65%. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that this plan awaits discussions with China, as the decision to lower tariffs will not be made unilaterally.\n2. China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday (4/24) stated that there are no tariff negotiations with the US, and claimed that allegations regarding progress in these talks lack factual basis. Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson, He Yadong, said that the US must abolish all unilateral tariffs against China if it truly wants to resolve this issue.\n3. Reuters reported that some OPEC+ members will propose the group accelerate oil output increases in June 2025, driven by disagreements among members regarding compliance with production quotas. If realized, this step would mark the second consecutive month of production increases. Oil prices themselves briefly reached their lowest point in the last 4 years in April 2025, pressured by the US-China trade war and the surprising decision from OPEC+ to increase oil production by 411,000 barrels per day starting in May 2025, which is 3 times more than initially planned. Eight OPEC+ member countries will hold a meeting on May 5, 2025, to discuss the June 2025 production plan.\n4. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, said on Thursday (4/24) that Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 is likely to remain around +5% YoY, despite global trade tensions (vs. 2024 realization: +5.03% YoY). Sri Mulyani's statement came two days after the IMF cut its forecast for Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 and 2026 from +5.1% YoY to +4.7% YoY, respectively. The government itself targets economic growth of +5.2% YoY in 2025, and President Prabowo Subianto promised to increase growth to +8% YoY by 2029.\n5. The Ministry of Investment and Downstreaming recorded that investment realization in Indonesia in 1Q25 reached 465.2 trillion rupiah (+15.9% YoY, +2.7% QoQ), equivalent to 24.4% of the 2025 target of 1,905.6 trillion rupiah, with a labor absorption of 594,104 people. Of this total investment realization, foreign investment contributed 230.4 trillion rupiah (+12.7% YoY), marking the weakest year-on-year growth in the last 5 quarters.\n6. Reuters reported that Indonesian coal buyers in China are not using the Reference Coal Price (HBA) in their transactions because this price reference is not transparent, is not updated quickly, and is more expensive. The Indonesian Coal Mining Association also told Reuters that Indonesian coal exporters are not using HBA as a price reference because Chinese importers are more familiar with the Indonesian Coal Index price mechanism. Previously, although implemented since March 1, 2025, the government granted a relaxation allowing exporters to still use the Indonesian Coal Index (ICI) as the selling price reference for existing contracts.\n7. Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jisman Hutajulu, said on Wednesday (4/23) that the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) for the 2025-2034 period does not include targets for early retirement of coal-fired power plants (PLTU). In line with Jisman, Member of Commission XII of the DPR, Ramson Siagian, stated that the decision to retire PLTUs will only be reviewed after the contracts with PLN are completed, to ensure future electricity supply. Previously, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued ESDM Ministerial Regulation No. 10/2025 which allows for the acceleration of PLTU operational termination.",

      "title": "UNVR 1Q25: Net Profit Exceeds Expectations",
      "content": "Unilever Indonesia ($UNVR) reported net profit of 1.24 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (-15% YoY, +245% QoQ), exceeding consensus expectations (equivalent to 32% of 2025F consensus estimate). The remediation program is starting to show results on the cost efficiency side, but revenue trends remain weak. Margins recovered significantly in 1Q25 amidst a revenue decline.\n1. Significant Margin Recovery\nGross profit margin recovered to 48.2% (vs. 1Q24: 49.9%, 4Q24: 44.5%) after being pressured in the previous 2 quarters around ~45% due to inventory reduction and transformation programs. Operating profit margin recovered more significantly to 17.1% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 18.7%, 4Q24: 6.7%) from levels of about 7-9% in the previous 2 quarters. The increase in operating profit margin was also contributed by a decrease in 'salary' costs (-45% YoY, -69% QoQ) due to the absence of one-off costs related to employee reduction. 'Advertising' costs remained relatively stable at 9.2% of revenue in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 9%, 4Q24: 5.8%, 2024: 8.8%).\n2. Revenue Remains Weak\nRevenue was recorded at 9.47 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (-6% YoY, +23% QoQ), with domestic sales volume down -8% YoY, while the average selling price (ASP) increased by +1.3% YoY. Segmentally, the 'home and personal care' segment booked a deeper revenue decline at -9% YoY, while the 'foods and refreshment' segment was more resilient with only a -1% YoY drop. Despite weak revenue, the gross profit margin for the 'home and personal care' segment recovered to 50.2% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 53.3%, 4Q24: 44.9%), indicating that cost efficiency was most felt in this segment.\nKey Takeaway\nThis performance recovery is in line with what we previously wrote, suggesting that UNVR's worst performance has likely passed. For context, here is the trend of UNVR's net profit growth year-on-year since 1Q24: 1Q24: +3%; 2Q24: -25%; 3Q24: -62%; 4Q24: -41%; 1Q25: -15%. UNVR management in the earnings call on Thursday (4/24) also maintained guidance that a more significant positive result from the remediation will be seen in 2H25. After cost-side remediation, we assess that UNVR needs to show progress on the revenue side, which we believe has the potential to drive more significant stock price recovery. In the last 1 month, UNVR has recovered +19.6%, higher than the IHSG recovery (+7.3%).\n*This article was released in Stockbit Commentary on Thursday (4/24) afternoon.",
