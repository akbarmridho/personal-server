      "title": "Rupiah Kembali Terdepresiasi ke ~16.600, Terlemah sejak April 2025",
      "content": "The Indonesian rupiah depreciated by 1.19% week-over-week on Monday (22/9) to a level of 16,605 per US dollar, marking the weakest level since April 2025 when the currency was pressured by the announcement of a reciprocal US tariff. The weekly weakening was mainly caused by negative sentiment related to two issues: 1) the independence of Bank Indonesia; and 2) the potential increase in government debt (deficit) to boost economic growth.\n\nLast week, Bank Indonesia cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%, outside consensus expectations and before the Federal Reserve meeting on 17 September 2025. According to a Reuters report, the decision sparked market concerns about Bank Indonesia's independence, which was perceived to prioritize growth over maintaining a stable rupiah exchange rate. Concerns about independence were also driven by a parliamentary discussion to amend Law No.4/2023 to broaden Bank Indonesia's mandate in supporting economic growth and give the parliament authority to recommend the dismissal of the Bank Indonesia governor.\n\nFiscal worries emerged alongside the increase in the 2026 state budget deficit target from 2.48% to 2.68%. Additionally, there is a parliamentary discussion to review the State Finance Law, which sets a maximum budget deficit of 3% of GDP and a total debt ceiling of 60% of GDP. The Finance Minister, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, said the current deficit and debt limits do not need to be changed. Fiscal policy, especially financing (deficit), has become a spotlight after the finance minister change from Sri Mulyani, who was known for fiscal discipline.\n\nCompared with neighboring countries, the rupiah was the weakest in the past week. The Thai baht and Philippine peso each appreciated +0.23% WoW and +0.24% WoW, while the Malaysian ringgit, Vietnamese dong, and South Korean won each weakened -0.09% WoW, -0.11% WoW, and -0.36% WoW against the US dollar.\n\nThe rupiah weakness also weighed on big bank stocks, where BBCA fell 3.74% WoW, BMRI fell 2.43% WoW and BBNI fell 4.54% WoW on Monday (22/9), while BBRI rose 0.48% WoW.",

      "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources imposed a temporary suspension of operations for up to 60 days on 190 mines that did not provide reclamation guarantees, according to a Shanghai Metals Market report. The decision, announced via letter No. 1533/MB.07/DJB.T/2025, follows three prior administrative warnings. The suspension can be lifted if the companies submit and obtain approval for reclamation plans and provide reclamation guarantees until 2025. Failure to comply may lead to permanent revocation of mining permits.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance reported on Monday (22/9) that the state budget realized a 1.35% of GDP deficit in the first eight months of 2025, better than the 2025 outlook of a 2.78% deficit. Revenue fell 7.8% YoY to IDR 1,638.7 trillion (57.2% of outlook), with tax receipts down 3.6% YoY to IDR 1,330.4 trillion (55.7% of outlook). Expenditure rose 1.5% YoY to IDR 1,960.3 trillion (55.6% of outlook). The primary balance remained a surplus of IDR 22 trillion. Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said economic growth will improve in the second half of 2025 as global uncertainty eases, government spending accelerates, and domestic demand strengthens.\n\nSpot gold rose 1.1% to USD 3,723 per troy ounce on Monday (22/9) afternoon, after reaching an intraday all-time high of USD 3,726, driven by market expectations of a more dovish US rate-cut outlook.\n\nThe Acting Chairman of the LPS Board, Didik Madiyono, announced that the maximum interest rate on rupiah deposits in commercial banks was lowered by 25 basis points to 3.5%, matching the pandemic low, while the maximum rate for foreign-currency deposits was also cut by 25 basis points to 2%. These rates will apply from 1 October 2025 to 31 January 2026, subject to change based on economic conditions.\n\nFinance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said the government is considering market-based incentives to encourage holders of US-dollar deposits to keep their funds domestically, aiming to strengthen foreign-exchange reserves, increase dollar supply in banks, and facilitate financing of strategic government projects.\n\nAgung Menjangan Mas (AMMS) announced that Radiant Ruby Company Ltd. plans to acquire about 80% of AMMS from PT Mandara Mas Semesta and Hartono Limmantoro. The transaction is still under negotiation, so the value is undisclosed. After completion, Radiant Ruby will become the new controlling shareholder of AMMS and will conduct a mandatory tender offer.",
