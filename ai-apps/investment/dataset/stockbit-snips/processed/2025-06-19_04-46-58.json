      "title": "APBN 5M25: Defisit 0.1%, Belanja Mulai Meningkat",
      "content": "The Ministry of Finance again held a briefing regarding the realization of the 2025 State Budget (APBN) on Tuesday (17/6). Here are some important points from the briefing: State Revenue Declined Driven by Weakening Tax Receipts State revenue during 5M25 decreased by -11.4% YoY, reaching only 33% of the 2025 APBN target (vs. 5M24: 40%). This decline was mainly caused by weakening tax receipts of -10.1% YoY. Deputy Minister of Finance, Anggito Abimanyu, attributed the decline in tax revenue to restitution factors, considering that gross tax revenue still tends to be flat on an annual basis. For information, at the end of May 2025, the government appointed Bimo Wijayanto as the new Director General of Taxes. State Expenditures Started to Increase in May 2025 Meanwhile, state expenditures during 5M25 also dropped by about -11% YoY and only reached 28% of the 2025 APBN target (vs. 5M24: 34%). This decline occurred amidst efficiency initiatives that President Prabowo Subianto started ordering since January 2025. Nevertheless, Deputy Minister of Finance, Suahasil Nazara, said that state expenditures surged in May 2025 along with the identification of program reallocation in the APBN. In the next 2 months, state expenditures will also be boosted by an economic stimulus of approximately 24 trillion rupiah in June-July 2025. The realization of government revenue and expenditures during 5M25 resulted in a deficit of 21 trillion rupiah or equivalent to 0.09% of GDP, still far below the 2025 target of 2.53% of GDP. Sweetened Beverage Excise (MBDK) Postponed for Implementation This Year On the same occasion, Director General of Customs and Excise, Djaka Budi Utama, said that the excise on packaged sweetened beverages (MBDK) will not be implemented this year, although it might still be implemented in the future. Djaka did not elaborate on the reason behind the postponement. Previously, at the beginning of 2025, the Director of Communication and User Services Guidance for Customs and Excise, Nirwala Dwi Heryanto, stated that the government planned to implement MBDK excise in 2H25. The government targets MBDK excise revenue of 3.8 trillion rupiah in the 2025 APBN. Key Takeaway We assess that the trend of accelerating state expenditures is one of the key factors to support economic growth in 2H25, especially amidst increasing global uncertainty from US trade policies and geopolitical tensions. Low state expenditure itself is one factor behind weak economic growth in 1Q25. Meanwhile, the re-postponement of MBDK excise implementation has the potential to provide temporary relief for several issuers, namely MYOR, SIDO, ULTJ, CMRY and ICBP.",
