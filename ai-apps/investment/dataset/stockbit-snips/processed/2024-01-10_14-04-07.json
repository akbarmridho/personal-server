      "content": "Key Takeaway: Slower growth in Third Party Funds compared to credit disbursement causes liquidity tightening (increasing LDR), leading to a 'price war' in grabbing DPK (cost of fund increases). This is reflected in the increase in interest expense for the big 4 banks (bank only) during 11M23 YoY, with BBCA +48%, BMRI +54%, BBNI +63%, and BBRI +71%.\nWe expect the cost of fund to decrease going forward along with the expectation of interest rate cuts. At this time, banks with lower LDR can utilize their liquidity to seize market share. The LDR (bank only) for the big 4 banks in November 2023 was: BBCA 71%, BBRI 87%, BMRI 88%, and BBNI 91%.",
