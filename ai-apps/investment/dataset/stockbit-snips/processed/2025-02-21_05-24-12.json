      "title": "BNGA 2024: Net Profit +5.4% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank CIMB Niaga (BNGA) recorded a net profit of 1.7 trillion rupiah in 4Q24 (+7.6% YoY, -1.9% QoQ). This result means the net profit for 2024 grew +5.4% YoY to 6.8 trillion rupiah, in line with expectations as it amounted to 101% of the consensus estimate. This performance was supported by credit cost (CoC), credit growth, and Net Interest Margin (NIM) which were all in line with guidance. - NIM Target at 3.9-4.2% in 2025. NIM in 4Q24 stood at 3.9% (-17 bps YoY, -19 bps QoQ), so the NIM for 2024 decreased to 4.1% (-31 bps YoY) and was in line with management guidance in the range of 4.1-4.2%. Loan yield in 4Q24 was recorded at 8.23% (+9 bps YoY, -20 bps QoQ), continuing the quarterly downward trend since 1Q24. On the other hand, cost of fund (CoF) increased to 3.58% (+41 bps YoY, +12 bps QoQ) along with the company's strategy to secure liquidity by increasing the time deposit rate. This result also continues the upward trend of CoF since 3Q22. BNGA management targets NIM in the range of 3.9-4.2% in 2025, considering that CoF will remain high and loan yield will be difficult to increase. - CoC Target at Â±1% in 2025. CoC in 4Q24 was recorded at 0.8% (+26 bps YoY, -19 bps QoQ), so the CoC for 2024 was maintained at 0.8% (-19 bps YoY) and in line with management guidance targeting <1%. This is reflected in the -16% YoY decrease in provision expenses during 2024, although it rose +18% YoY in 4Q24 due to a low-base effect. In terms of asset quality, Gross Non-Performing Loans (NPL) and Loan-at-Risk (LAR) in 4Q24 decreased to 1.8% (-20 bps YoY) and 8.6% (-260 bps YoY) respectively. BNGA management targets stable CoC around 1% in 2025. - Credit Growth Target at +5-7% YoY in 2025. Credit growth reached +6.9% YoY in 2024 (vs. 2023: +8.5% YoY), at the upper limit of management guidance ranging from +5-7% YoY. Growth was primarily driven by the automotive segment (+26% YoY) and small-medium enterprises (+9.1% YoY). Meanwhile, third-party funds (DPK) grew +10.5% YoY in 2024 (vs. 2023: +3.8% YoY), marking the highest growth since 1Q22. Higher DPK growth than credit caused the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) to drop to 86.3% in 2024 (vs. 2024: 89.3%). BNGA management targets credit growth in the range of +5-7% YoY in 2025. - Dividend Payout Ratio 50% for 2024; 2025 Target up to 60%. BNGA management issued dividend payout ratio guidance for the 2024 fiscal year of 50% of the bank-only net profit (vs. 2023 fiscal year: 60%), indicating a dividend yield of 7.5% based on the price as of Thursday (20/2) at 1,720 rupiah per share. Going forward, BNGA management plans a dividend payout ratio of up to 60% for the 2025 fiscal year. Key Takeaway We assess BNGA's performance in 2024 as good, especially because NIM, CoC, and credit growth were in line with guidance, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the decrease in LDR as a plus point, considering the tight liquidity conditions seen in other banking issuers.",
