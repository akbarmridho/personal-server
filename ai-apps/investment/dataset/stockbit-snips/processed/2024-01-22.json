      "title": "Nickel Prices Continue to Fall, Global Producers Shaken",
      "content": "The prolonged decline in nickel prices is beginning to have a negative impact on global nickel producers, especially in Australia. Some producers have decided to temporarily close their mines, while others have announced they will re-evaluate their projects. Wyloo Metals announced it will temporarily shut down its Kambalda nickel mine in Australia at the end of May 2024 due to low nickel prices, just six months after acquiring the mine for USD 760 million. BHP is re-evaluating its nickel business and may postpone a USD 1.2 billion nickel project in West Musgrave, Australia, while seeking options to mitigate the sharp price drop; further details are expected in its mid-year report on 20 February 2024. First Quantum Minerals will cut staff and production at its Ravensthorpe mine in Australia because of a significant nickel price decline. As of 22 January 2024, nickel prices have fallen 44.64 % year-on-year to USD 15,799 per tonne, pressured by a surge in supply from Indonesia, the world’s largest producer. The International Nickel Study Group projects global nickel surplus to widen from 223,000 tonnes in 2023 to 239,000 tonnes in 2024. BloombergNEF analyst Allan Ray Restauro said Indonesian nickel projects are more flexible in absorbing the price drop due to low labor costs, cheap energy and abundant raw materials. Citigroup forecasts nickel prices to fall to USD 15,500 per tonne in three months, while ING Group projects an average price of USD 16,813 per tonne for the full year 2024. Key takeaway: the expected continued pressure on nickel prices will challenge the profitability of nickel mining companies, favoring those with efficient operations and low-cost structures.",
