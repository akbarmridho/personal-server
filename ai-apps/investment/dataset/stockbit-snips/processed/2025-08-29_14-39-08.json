      "title": "S&P500 Prints ATH Amid US GDP Upward Revision",
      "content": "The S&P500 printed an all-time high in Thursday's (8/28) trading session, rising +0.32% to the 6,502 level, following the upward revision of US GDP data for 2Q25 on the same day. US economic growth in 2Q25 was revised up by the US Bureau of Statistics to +3.3% annualized (vs. 1Q25: -0.5% annualized), higher than the consensus expectation of +3.1% and the initial estimate of +3%. On a weekly basis, the S&P500 index strengthened by +2.07%, the US Dollar Index (DXY) was relatively flat (-0.82%), while the 10-year US government bond yield fell -12 basis points to 4.2% as of Thursday (8/28). This movement followed the statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last Friday (8/22) which signaled that the central bank is opening the possibility of a US interest rate cut at the September 2025 meeting in line with increased labor market risks. Following the revision of US economic growth data, the probability of a US interest rate cut at the September 2025 meeting remained stable weekly at ~85% as of Friday (8/29), based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. Amid the rise in the S&P500, the IHSG fell -1.53% to the 7,830 level today, Friday (8/29), in line with negative sentiment from a series of demonstrations since the beginning of this week.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "In the near future, the market awaits the US core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index data to be released on Friday (8/29) local time, US labor data release on Friday (9/5) next week, and the US inflation data release on September 11, 2025. These three data points have the potential to influence the Fed's decision on interest rates at the September 16-17, 2025 meeting. Jeff Roach from LPL Financial stated that weaker US labor data could suppress economic growth momentum from the previous quarter, thus opening further opportunities for an interest rate cut.",

      "content": "1. AADI: Adaro Andalan Indonesia recorded a net profit of 233 million US dollars in 2Q25 (+18.7% QoQ, -60% YoY). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 429 million US dollars (-50.1% YoY), exceeding expectations as it equates to 56.7% of the 2025F consensus estimate. The quarterly increase in net profit in 2Q25 was due to a revenue increase (+6.1% QoQ), a decrease in operating expenses (-3.4% QoQ), and a reversal of other losses from a loss of 5 million US dollars in 1Q25 to a profit of 28 million US dollars in 2Q25, causing the net profit margin to rise to 18.8% in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: 16.8%). Operationally, AADI recorded an operating profit of 292 million US dollars in 2Q25 (+0.9% QoQ, +2.5% YoY), resulting in an operating profit for 1H25 reaching 581 million US dollars (-9.5% YoY) and exceeding expectations (63.7% of the 2025F consensus estimate).
