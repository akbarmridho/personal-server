This projection increase is based on stronger than expected purchases ahead of the August 1, 2025 tariff deadline, as well as tariff reductions by the US for a number of key trading partners. The IMF also increased the projection for Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 and 2026 to +4.8% YoY from the projection downgraded in April 2025 at the +4.7% YoY level.",

      "content": "Reuters reported that the Indonesian Coal Miners Association (APBI) estimates coal demand from the smelter industry will peak at 84.2 million tons in 2026, before declining to 78.6 million tons in 2027. This projected decline in demand is based on overcapacity in the nickel sector and the potential implementation of stricter emission regulations. News regarding the prospect of slowing coal demand from the smelter industry emerges amid a contraction in Indonesian coal export volume by -12.6% YoY during 1H25, according to data from Kpler. The smelter industry in Indonesia itself - which mostly processes nickel - is one of the sources of Indonesian coal demand. According to Global Energy Monitor, the nickel smelter industry has pushed captive power plant capacity in Indonesia from 5.5 GW in 2019 to 16.6 GW in 2024.",
