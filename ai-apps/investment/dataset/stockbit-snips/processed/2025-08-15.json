      "title": "RAPBN 2026: Economy Targeted +5.4% via 8 Priority Programs",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto gave a state of the nation address on the 2026 budget target and program, released together with the RAPBN 2026 financial note (see table above). The government has eight priority programs for 2026: 1) food security; 2) energy security; 3) Free Nutritious Meals (MBG); 4) education; 5) health; 6) village, cooperative and MSME development; 7) defense; and 8) acceleration of investment and global trade. \n\n1. Food security – the budget for this program rises +32.6% YoY to IDR 164.6 trillion (vs. APBN 2025: +8.8% YoY). The allocation covers food distribution and reserves (IDR 29.9 trillion), production (IDR 114.1 trillion) and consumption (IDR 6.4 trillion). \n2. Education and MBG – the education budget is set at IDR 757.8 trillion (+4.8% YoY), the highest in Indonesian history. The budget includes the MBG program at IDR 335 trillion (vs. APBN 2025: IDR 171 trillion), according to the National Nutrition Agency’s proposal. The MBG program in 2026 is targeted to reach 82.9 million beneficiaries, up from the current level of about 20 million. \n3. Energy security – the energy-security budget is set at IDR 402.4 trillion, to be allocated to energy subsidies, tax incentives, renewable energy development (EBT), and village electricity supply. President Prabowo reiterated his hope that 100% of power generation will come from EBT within ten years, earlier than the global 2060 target. \n4. Village, cooperative and MSME development – total allocation is IDR 181.8 trillion, with the Red-White Village Cooperative (Kopdes) receiving IDR 83 trillion from the state budget, to be disbursed through Himbara. \n5. More centralized state spending – from a total state expenditure of IDR 3,787 trillion (+7.3% YoY), central-government spending will rise +17.8% YoY while transfers to regions fall –24.8% YoY. \n6. 3-million-house programme – about 770,000 houses will be supported by the budget with a total allocation of IDR 57.7 trillion, mainly through the Housing Liquidity Facility (FLPP). \n\nKey Takeaway: Overall, the priority programmes align with the narrative since the new administration took office, so there are no surprises. In terms of fiscal posture, we view the target of a +13% YoY tax-revenue increase in 2026 as challenging. The announced budget for the Red-White Village Cooperative of IDR 83 trillion gives a modest certainty for state-owned bank stocks. By comparison, with a loan ceiling of IDR 3 billion per cooperative, the roughly 80,000 cooperatives would need a total funding of about IDR 240 trillion.",

      "content": "The Constitutional Court on Thursday (14 August) rejected a material-law challenge to Law No. 7/2021 on tax-policy harmonisation. One of the lawsuits argued that the law fails to guarantee legal certainty and a decent standard of living because of difficulty in meeting basic-needs items. The Court held that the 5-15 % VAT range in the law is a flexible fiscal policy that allows the government to adjust the rate according to national economic conditions while still respecting the “no taxation without representation” principle. The Court also explained that the VAT rate can be set by the government after it is presented to the DPR for discussion and inclusion in the RAPBN, thus still meeting the principle.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. producer-price index rose 0.9 % month-on-month in July 2025 (vs. 0 % in June 2025), well above the 0.2 % consensus and the highest increase since June 2022.\n\nChina’s National Bureau of Statistics reported that retail sales grew +3.7 % YoY in July 2025 (vs. +4.8 % in June 2025), missing the consensus of +4.6 % YoY and marking the weakest growth since December 2024. In the same data set, China’s unemployment rose to 5.2 % in July 2025 (vs. 5.0 % in June 2025), above the 5.1 % consensus and the highest since March 2025.\n\nAmman Mineral International (AMMN) director David Alexander Gibbs sold about 3.5 million AMMN shares at an average of IDR 8,635 per share on 8 August 2025. The transaction value was about IDR 30.5 billion. After the transaction, Gibbs’s direct holding fell from 0.016 % to 0.011 %.\n\nLippo Karawaci (LPKR) recorded marketing sales of IDR 2.47 trillion in 1H 2025 (-21.3 % YoY), equal to 40 % of the 2025 target of IDR 6.25 trillion.\n\nFutura Energi Global (FUTR) announced that PT Aurora Dhana Nusantara has signed a term sheet to acquire about 3.3 billion (49.325 %) shares of FUTR from existing controller PT Digital Futurama Global. The transaction value and closing date were not disclosed. The term-sheet signing does not yet constitute a change of control under POJK No. 9/2018 until the acquisition is completed.\n\nTwo largest shareholders of Impack Pratama Industri (IMPC), PT Harimas Tunggal Perkasa and PT Tunggal Jaya Investama, sold 600 million (1.11 %) and 800 million (1.47 %) shares respectively at an average of IDR 660 per share on 13-14 August 2025. The transactions valued at IDR 396 billion and IDR 528 billion respectively. After the deals, Harimas’ stake fell from 45.84 % to 44.73 % and Tunggal Jaya’s stake fell from 44.09 % to 42.62 %.",
