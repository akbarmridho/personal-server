      "title": "Important Developments During the Eid al-Fitr Holiday",
      "content": "During the 2024 Eid al-Fitr holiday period, several developments need attention from investors: 1. US Inflation Rebounds Beyond Expectations - The US recorded inflation of 3.5% YoY in March 2024 (vs. February 2024: inflation 3.2%), exceeding consensus expectations at 3.4%. This figure marks the third consecutive month of US inflation data coming higher than expected since January 2024, thereby strengthening the narrative of higher for longer rates. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the market currently expects the Fed will only start cutting interest rates in 3Q24, later than previous expectations which projected rate cuts would begin in June 2024. Here are some implications of the US inflation development as of Tuesday (16/4): - The yield on the 10-year US government bond continued to climb from the level of ~4.2% at the end of March 2024 to ~4.6%. - The US Dollar Index (DXY) rose from the 104 level at the end of March 2024 to the range of 106. - The S&P 500 stock index fell -3.7% MTD. - For Indonesia, the negative impact is already visible in the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, which weakened further from the level of 15,880 at the end of March 2024 to 16,176. 2. Increasing Geopolitical Tensions - On April 13, 2024, Iran launched an attack on Israel. This conflict escalation is further pushing up the prices of several commodities, such as crude oil, gold, and silver. 3. Rising Commodity Prices due to Supply Issues and/or Better Demand Outlook - Besides the geopolitical tension factor, numerous commodities also experienced price strengthening due to supply problems and a better demand outlook. - Crude Oil: Driven by expectations of a world oil deficit in 2024 alongside low supply due to OPEC+ production cuts and a higher-than-initially-forecasted demand outlook due to stronger-than-expected US and China economic data. - Tin: Driven by low supply due to uncertainty regarding Indonesian and Myanmar exports, better manufacturing activity in the US and China, and the prohibition of Russian metal mine production from being traded on the London Metal Exchange. - Copper: Potential for a supply shortage due to the closure of one of the worldâ€™s largest copper mines, The Cobre, located in Panama. Furthermore, price strengthening is also driven by the potential increase in copper demand for energy transition purposes. - Nickel: The US and UK governments issued trade ban sanctions against Russian commodities, namely nickel, copper, and aluminum. This impacted the increased volatility in the price movements of these commodities. - Pulp: Supply disruption from producers in Finland due to demonstrations at Finnish ports since the beginning of March 2024.",

      "content": "A series of negative sentiments above caused the IHSG to weaken by -1.68% on Tuesday (16/4), with interest rate-sensitive sectors - such as property (-3.25%), technology (-2.85%), and finance (-2.49%) - experiencing significant declines. However, we assess that this correction could be an opportunity for investors to buy banking stocks with more attractive valuations, because in our opinion the fundamentals and prospects are still good. Meanwhile, the rising trend in commodity prices and the strengthening of the US dollar potentially bring positive impacts for the commodity issuers above.",
