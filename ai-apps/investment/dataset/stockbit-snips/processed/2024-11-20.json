      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, Predicts Slower Fed Cuts",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (20 November 2024) decided to keep the BI Rate at 6%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5.25% and 6.75% respectively. The decision was in line with consensus expectations. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the decision aims to strengthen the stability of the rupiah amid geopolitical uncertainty and the global economy, especially as the U.S. dollar strengthens after former President Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Perry said the rupiah’s weakening against the dollar was mainly driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) due to the inflationary policy plan promoted by Trump.\n\nPerry also said that the Fed’s rate cuts will be limited as the U.S. economy is still expected to perform well in 2025. He noted that the central bank still expects a Fed cut of –25 basis points in December 2024. However, for 2025, Bank Indonesia now expects a Fed cut of –50 basis points, lower than the previous projection of –75 to –100 basis points. This latest Bank Indonesia projection aligns with market expectations from the CME FedWatch Tool.\n\nAs expectations for Fed cuts recede, Indonesia’s capital markets have experienced outflows. Since the start of November 2024, the Indonesian bond market has seen outflows of IDR 9 trillion as of 13 November 2024, while equity market outflows reached IDR 11 trillion as of 19 November 2024. The foreign outflow has also weakened the rupiah by –0.9% month‑to‑date to IDR 15,858 per US$ on 20 November 2024.\n\nKey Takeaway: To mitigate volatility risk from uncertain interest‑rate direction, investors can lock in high yields on FR bonds – especially short‑term series such as PBS032 – at attractive levels. In addition, the SBN Retail ST013, currently in its offering period, can be an alternative because it carries a floating‑with‑floor coupon.",
