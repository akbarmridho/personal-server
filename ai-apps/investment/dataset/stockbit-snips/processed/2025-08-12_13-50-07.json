      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on Monday (11/8) extended the pause on the implementation of tariffs on goods originating from China for 90 days until November 10, 2025, a move that could ease concerns over a tariff war and provide time for the two countries to negotiate further. Previously, in June 2025, China and the US had reached a trade framework agreement. Bloomberg reported that if Trump had not extended the pause, tariffs on goods originating from China to the US would have jumped to at least 54% by early Tuesday (12/8) local time.",

      "title": "Bel S.A. Acquires 22.5% Stake in KEJU worth Rp709 Billion",
      "content": "French Mitra Garudafood Putra Putri Jaya ($GOOD) associate, Bel S.A., purchased approximately 1.3 billion shares of Mulia Boga Raya ($KEJU) at an average price of 560 rupiah per share on August 8, 2025, which is 12.5% lower than KEJU's closing share price of 640 rupiah per share on the same trading day. Following this transaction worth approximately 709 billion rupiah, Bel S.A.'s ownership in KEJU increased from none to 22.5%. This transaction follows GOOD's announcement last week of a framework agreement to collaborate with Bel S.A. to jointly become the controller in KEJU. GOOD also explained that Bel S.A. will gain management rights to determine KEJU's financial and operational policies. Before this cooperation, GOOD held a 66.07% ownership stake in KEJU as of the end of July 2025. This collaboration aims to develop KEJU's business by leveraging Bel S.A.'s expertise in the cheese and cheese-based snack categories. Bel S.A. itself is a renowned global cheese producer, having been established for over 150 years and currently owning global brands such as The Laughing Cow and Kiri. During 1H25, KEJU recorded net profit growth of +37% YoY (vs. 1H24: +85% YoY) and revenue growth of +12% YoY (vs. 1H24: +28% YoY). KEJU's share price strengthened again by +16% on Tuesday (12/8) following the announcement of the transaction value today, after having corrected on Friday (7/8) when the framework agreement between GOOD and Bel S.A. was announced. Key Takeaway: As seen in the table, Bel S.A.'s acquisition of KEJU was done at a valuation generally considered premium compared to peers, although at a discount to KEJU's current valuation. Higher profitability (ROE) and better performance growth potentially justify the premium valuation. Furthermore, the synergy that can be generated - considering Bel S.A.'s expertise in related businesses - is another potential upside seen by Bel S.A., hence the company views attractive value in this transaction.",
