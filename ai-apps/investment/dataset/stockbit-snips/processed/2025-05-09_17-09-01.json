      "title": "RI Stops Rice Imports, Highest Stock in 57 Years",
      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, said on Thursday (8/5) that the government will no longer import rice in 2025, following a significant surge in domestic production and stock. Indonesia itself produced 8.61 million tons of rice in 1Q25 (+53% YoY). Meanwhile, Perum Bulog recorded that the government's rice reserve stock at the Bulog Warehouse as of early May 2025 reached 3.6 million tons, marking the highest level in the last 57 years. Besides BPS, the US Department of Agriculture in its report in April 2025 estimated that Indonesian rice production in the 2024/2025 planting season will increase +4.8% YoY to 34.6 million tons, marking the highest production volume projection in the Southeast Asian region. For context, the government targeted national rice production at 32.8 million tons for 2025. The increase in national rice production reflects the recovery post-El Nino during 2023, which impacted early 2024 when domestic rice prices surged around +20% YoY in March 2024. The abundance of national rice supply is also reflected in the decline of rice prices around 1-2% YoY in April 2025, continuing the decline of around 4-9% YoY in March 2025. Key Takeaway: The increase in domestic rice production and stocks has the potential to limit the possibility of rice price spikes like those that occurred in early 2024. Rice prices have tended to be stable since 2H24. If rice management can be done well - so that production increases can continue, but with stable prices (not significantly decreasing) - this has the potential to positively impact community purchasing power and also farmer income. Furthermore, the non-necessity of rice imports can reduce Indonesia's import value. During 10M24, BPS recorded that Indonesia imported 3.48 million tons of rice valued at US$2.2 billion or ~IDR 34.2 trillion.",
