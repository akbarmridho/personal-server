      "title": "US & China Reach Temporary Trade Agreement",
      "content": "The United States and China announced on Monday (May 14, 2025) a temporary trade agreement following the two-country meeting in Switzerland at the end of the previous weekend. This is the first US-China meeting since the United States announced reciprocal tariffs in April 2025. Under the agreement, both sides will reduce import tariffs by 115 percent for at least 90 days. China will cut tariffs on US products from 125 percent to 10 percent, while the United States will lower tariffs on Chinese products from 145 percent to 30 percent. Although not included in the joint statement, the two parties are also reported to reduce other trade barriers: Reuters reported that China will relax export restrictions to the United States for rare-earth and magnet commodities used in high-technology industries; Bloomberg reported that the Chinese government has lifted the ban on Boeing aircraft imports; the United States announced a reduction of the de-minimis tariff for China from 120 percent to 54 percent (the de-minimis tariff applies to low-value shipments up to US$800). Reuters further reported that the de-minimis cut now follows the general tariff reduction to 30 percent. The de-escalation of the trade war improves US economic prospects. Goldman Sachs on Monday (May 12) cut the probability of a US recession from 45 percent to 35 percent and raised the 2025 US growth forecast from 0.5 percent to 1 percent. Optimism is also supported by the US consumer price index (CPI) for April 2025, which was 2.3 percent year-on-year (versus 2.4 percent in March), below the consensus estimate of 2.4 percent and marking the lowest annual level since February 2021. As the outlook improves, the market consensus expects the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut pace to slow. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a rate cut larger than 50 basis points by the end of 2025 fell to 35.9 percent on Wednesday (May 14), down sharply from 75.7 percent a week earlier. Although the temporary agreement is in place, US President Donald Trump said that US import tariffs on China could rise significantly if negotiations during the 90-day period fail to reach a final deal, but he emphasized that the United States will not raise tariffs back to the previous 145 percent level. Following the US-China agreement, the US dollar index (DXY) rose 1.09 percent to 101.79 on Monday (May 12). On the same day, the Nasdaq gained 4.35 percent, the S&P 500 rose 3.26 percent and the DJIA increased 2.81 percent. Asian markets also rallied on Monday (May 12), with the Nikkei up 2.24 percent and the Hang Seng up 1.57 percent. Gold, a safe-haven asset, fell 2.66 percent on Monday (May 12) to US$3,236.4 per ounce. In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rose 2.15 percent to 6,979.8 on Wednesday (May 14), driven by a significant foreign inflow of 2.84 trillion rupiah, the highest daily inflow since the announcement of the US reciprocal tariffs. Key Takeaway: Although Indonesia has not yet reached a trade agreement with the United States, the improved global growth outlook resulting from the US-China de-escalation could positively affect Indonesia. Lower external risk and a risk-on sentiment may also stabilize the rupiah, giving Bank Indonesia room to cut rates and support domestic economic growth.",

      "content": "1. $ASII: Astra International recorded vehicle wholesales of 26,976 units in April 2025 (0 percent year-on-year, -29 percent month-on-month), lower than the industry average of +5 percent YoY and -28 percent MoM, causing ASII’s market share to fall to 52.7 percent (April 2024: 55.2 percent, March 2025: 53.2 percent). April wholesales were supported by Toyota and Lexus sales of 16,268 units (+5 percent YoY, -28 percent MoM), while Daihatsu sales fell to 8,884 units (-6 percent YoY, -32 percent MoM). Cumulatively, ASII’s vehicle wholesales for the first four months of 2025 declined to 137,788 units (-6 percent YoY), with market share dropping to 53.7 percent (4M24: 55.5 percent). 2. $ENRG: Energi Mega Persada announced the discovery of crude oil in the Bentu work area, Riau, with an initial estimate of 20 million barrels. The find could add 1,500-2,500 barrels of oil per day, representing 17.6-29.5 percent of ENRG’s gross production in 1Q25 (8,479 barrels per day). Bentu is primarily a gas asset with 375.6 billion cubic feet of gas reserves as of 1 January 2025 and is targeted to produce 93 million cubic feet per day in 2025.

This corporate action is separate from the existing buyback; as of April 2025, GOTO had already executed a buyback worth US$112.3 million (about IDR 1.8 trillion) out of a total maximum allocation of US$200 million.

The request follows a slow commissioning process due to stabilization and optimization phases, meaning the smelter’s operating capacity is not yet at full level. AMMN’s concentrate exports ended on 31 December 2024. 6. $BFIN: BFI Finance Indonesia will distribute a 2024 dividend of approximately IDR 902.4 billion, corresponding to a 58 percent dividend payout ratio, indicating a final dividend of IDR 32 per share and a dividend yield of 3.5 percent.

      "content": "1. MSCI announced a review of the Global Standard Index, Small Cap Index, and Micro Cap Index effective 2 June 2025 – 31 August 2025. $MTEL and $MBMA were added to the MSCI Indonesia Small Cap Index, while $HRUM, $INDY, $SMRA, and $WIKA were removed from that index. No changes were made to the MSCI Indonesia Global Standard or MSCI Indonesia Micro Cap indices. The next review will be announced on 12 August 2025 with an effective date of 1 September 2025. 2. Gaikindo reported that national vehicle wholesales in April 2025 reached 51,205 units (+5 percent YoY, -28 percent MoM). The 4-month total fell to 256,368 units (-3 percent YoY), aligning with expectations as it represents 28-34 percent of the 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 units (4M24: 30 percent of 2024 realization). Gaikindo chairman Jongkie Sugiarto explained that the monthly decline was caused by fewer working days due to the long Eid holiday. 3. Bank Indonesia projected a -2.2 percent YoY and -6.9 percent MoM contraction in Indonesian retail sales for April 2025, reflecting normalized consumer demand after Ramadan and Eid. Retail sales in March 2025 grew +5.5 percent YoY and +13.6 percent MoM, surpassing the Bank Indonesia forecast of +0.5 percent YoY and +8.3 percent MoM. 4. Commodity analysis firm Kpler reported that Indonesia’s thermal coal exports fell by 20 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes in 4M25 (-12 percent YoY), the lowest volume in three years and the worst annual percentage decline since early 2017. The drop was driven by reduced shipments to China (down 14 million tonnes, -20 percent YoY) and India (down 6 million tonnes, -15 percent YoY). 5. Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government raised the export levy on crude palm oil (CPO) from 7.5 percent to 10 percent effective 17 May 2025 to fund B40 programs and replanting. The levy on crude palm olein increased from 6 percent to 9.5 percent, refined bleached and deodorized palm olein from 4.5 percent to 7.5 percent, and biodiesel from 3 percent to 4.75 percent. 6. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that the US CPI for April 2025 was 2.3 percent YoY and 0.2 percent MoM (March: 2.4 percent YoY, -0.1 percent MoM), both below consensus expectations of 2.4 percent YoY and 0.3 percent MoM, marking the lowest annual CPI since February 2021. Core CPI remained unchanged at 2.8 percent YoY, matching consensus and representing the lowest level in four years. 7. The Democratic Republic of Congo is expected to tighten cobalt exports after a four-month ban that ended in February 2025, according to Minister Patrick Luabeya. The country plans to introduce export quotas and may partner with Indonesia to manage global cobalt supply and pricing. 8. Shareholder PT Autum Prima Indonesia sold approximately 24.1 million shares of $SINI at IDR 1,000 per share on 9 May 2025, totaling about IDR 24 billion, to increase the public float. The transaction reduced Autum’s ownership from 35 percent to 30 percent. 9. Intanwijaya International ($INCI) will distribute a 2024 dividend of approximately IDR 7.3 billion, or IDR 35 per share, representing a 28 percent payout ratio and a dividend yield of 5.8 percent. The cum-date is 30 June 2025 on the regular market, with payment on 17 July 2025.",
