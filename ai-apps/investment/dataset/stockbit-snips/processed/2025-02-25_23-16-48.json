      "title": "Government Reportedly to Immediately Lift iPhone 16 Sales Ban",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that the government and Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) have agreed on terms to lift the ban on the sale of the iPhone 16 series in Indonesia, ending five months of negotiations in which Apple increased its investment offer by 100 times fold to 1 billion US dollars. Bloomberg sources mentioned that the Ministry of Industry will sign a memorandum of understanding with Apple as soon as this week. Neither Apple nor the Ministry of Industry has commented on this report. In addition to the 1 billion US dollar investment, Bloomberg sources stated that Apple will commit to training local people in the company's research and development (R&D) of products. This R&D training will be conducted through programs other than the existing Apple Developer Academy. Bloomberg reported that in the agreement, Apple does not plan to immediately manufacture iPhones in Indonesia. Previously, Bloomberg reported in December 2024 that Apple's 1 billion US dollar investment offer included the construction of an AirTag factory in Batam, targeted to generate 20% of global AirTag production. News regarding the agreement between the government and Apple emerged nearly 2 months after the Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, met with Apple's Vice President of Global Policy, Nick Ammann, in early January 2025. Agus at that time stated that an investment value of 1 billion US dollars was not enough, and urged Apple to build an iPhone component factory in Indonesia to obtain the Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certificate, which is a requirement for sales permits. Last week, Agus said that Apple had paid an investment debt of 10 million US dollars, which was the remainder of the investment commitment for the 2020-2024 period.",

Debt monetization refers to the practice where the government borrows money from the central bank to finance public spending, rather than issuing bonds to private investors or by increasing taxes. Lionel Priyadi, Fixed Income and Macro Strategist at PT Mega Capital, told Bloomberg that the government must clarify the form of these housing bonds. Otherwise, Lionel mentioned that the market will interpret the issuance of these bonds as a potential widening of the budget deficit, which could drive up government bond yields.",
