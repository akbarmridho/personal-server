      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, announced a postponement of the implementation of a 25% import tariff for Canada and Mexico for 30 days while negotiations continue to increase law enforcement efforts at the borders of these countries with the US. Meanwhile, an additional 10% import tariff for China will apply as scheduled, effective Tuesday (4/2) local time. This agreement came just a few days after Trump last weekend announced he would impose a 25% import tariff for Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% import tariff on top of existing tariffs for China effective Tuesday (4/2). Trump previously stated that the imposition of these tariffs was in response to the flow of narcotics and immigrants entering the US from these countries. Following the effectivity of tariffs from the US, China also announced on Tuesday (4/2) afternoon that it would impose additional import tariffs on several commodities from the US effective February 10, 2025, consisting of: Additional tariff of 15% for coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG); Additional tariff of 10% for crude oil, agricultural machinery, large engine capacity cars, and pick-up trucks. Besides imposing additional tariffs, China also took several other actions, such as an investigation into alleged anti-monopoly violations by Google, imposing export restrictions on tungsten and other rare earth elements in technology products, and limiting the operations of several US companies such as Illumina and PVH Corp. Following these developments, the US dollar index (DXY) and US stock futures moved volatilesly on Tuesday (4/2). DXY strengthened up to above 109 but is now at the level of 108.5. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures fell -0.16% after having strengthened +0.78% in early trading. Commodity prices that will be subject to additional tariffs by China also decreased, with WTI oil prices in the futures market weakening -2.06% to the level of 71.7 US dollars per barrel and natural gas prices falling -3.98% to the level of 3.22 US dollars per MMBtu.",
