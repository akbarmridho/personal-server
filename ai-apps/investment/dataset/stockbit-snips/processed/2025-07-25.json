      "content": "1. CNN reported that Thailand and Cambodia were engaged in a firefight along their shared border for the second consecutive day on Friday (25 July), with more than a dozen people reported dead and over 100,000 civilians evacuated. Tensions between the two countries have escalated over the past several months, driven by a territorial dispute along the land border.\n2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Thursday (24 July) that the exemption from TKDN requirements in the trade framework agreement with the United States does not apply to all U.S. products. He explained that the TKDN exemption applies only to information and communication technology (ICT) products, data centers, and medical device components. He added that these products must still comply with import regulations set by the technical ministries and be certified by the relevant authorities, such as the Food and Drug Authority.\n3. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto also stated on Thursday (24 July) that there is no removal of the ban on the export of Indonesia's critical minerals in the detailed framework of the trade agreement with the United States. He noted that the export of Indonesian minerals must continue to follow existing regulations, i.e., they must be processed domestically. His comment came after the White House announced that Indonesia agreed to lift restrictions on the export of industrial commodities, including critical minerals, under the trade framework.\n4. The Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki) estimates that Indonesia's palm oil exports will decline by about 5.1 percent year-on-year in 2025 to 28 million tons, due to higher domestic consumption driven by increased biodiesel blending, according to a Bloomberg report. Gapki's chairman, Eddy Martono, said that domestic palm oil production is expected to grow by 3.7 percent year-on-year in 2025 to 50 million tons. Gapki also projects that Indonesia's palm oil exports to the United States could rise from 2.2 million tons in 2024 to between 2.3 and 2.4 million tons in 2025 if tariffs on the commodity are reduced from the current 19 percent.\n5. Subsidiary Sumber Global Energy (SGER) and Bintang Mitra Semestaraya (BSMR) signed an amendment to their syndicated loan agreement, increasing the facility from 160 billion rupiah to 350 billion rupiah, with an option to raise it to 600 billion rupiah. The loan is intended for the construction of Indonesia's second-largest hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plant, with an annual production capacity of 20,000 metric tons.\n6. Chief Commissioner of Nusa Raya Cipta (NRCA), Johannes Suriadjaja, sold approximately 1.8 million NRCA shares at an average price of 1,015 rupiah per share on 21 July 2025, totaling about 1.8 billion rupiah. After this transaction, his ownership in NRCA fell from 0.15 percent to 0.08 percent. On the same day, PT Persada Capital Investama purchased 4 million NRCA shares at an average price of 815 rupiah per share, totaling about 3.3 billion rupiah, raising its ownership from zero to 0.16 percent.",

      "title": "BBNI 1H25: Net Profit Down 6% YoY, Below Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) reported a net profit of 4.7 trillion rupiah for the second quarter of 2025, a decrease of 12 percent year-on-year and 12 percent quarter-on-quarter. This result makes the net profit for the first half of 2025 total 10.1 trillion rupiah, down 6 percent year-on-year, below expectations as it represents only 46 percent of the 2025 consensus estimate (versus an average of 50 percent annual realization over the past two years). Net profit was pressured by weak Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) and higher provisions. PPOP fell 5 percent year-on-year in Q2 and 2 percent year-on-year in the first half, as Non-Interest Income declined 2 percent year-on-year in Q2 and 3 percent year-on-year in the first half, while operating expenses rose 5 percent year-on-year in Q2 and 3 percent year-on-year in the first half. Net Interest Income was relatively stable, increasing 0 percent year-on-year in Q2 and 2 percent year-on-year in the first half, but far below credit growth of 7 percent year-on-year as of June 2025, highlighting margin pressure. Net Interest Margin (NIM) fell to 3.7 percent in Q2 2025 (versus 4.0 percent in Q2 2024 and 3.9 percent in Q1 2025) due to high cost of funds, leaving the first-half NIM at 3.8 percent (versus 4.0 percent in the first half of 2024). Provision expenses rose to 2 trillion rupiah in Q2 2025, up 15 percent year-on-year and 15 percent quarter-on-quarter, resulting in total provisions of 3.8 trillion rupiah for the first half, up 8 percent year-on-year. The Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio stood at 1.9 percent in Q2 2025 (versus 2.0 percent in Q2 2024 and 2.0 percent in Q1 2025). The consumer segment saw NPL increase to 2.1 percent (versus 1.6 percent in Q2 2024 and 2.0 percent in Q1 2025), mainly driven by mortgage and auto financing, which management attributes to weakened purchasing power. Management did not provide a full explanation of the involvement in the Merah Putih Village Cooperative, but said discussions with the government consider all stakeholders. In credit granting, the bank will conduct borrower assessments and expects the credit allocation to remain manageable. Key takeaway: the weakness in Q2 aligns with earlier notes. After releasing the first-half results, BBNI lowered its 2025 NIM guidance from a range of 4.0-4.2 percent to a minimum of 3.8 percent, despite expecting banking liquidity to improve in the second half of 2025 due to lower yields and SRBI holdings, a reduction in the BI rate, and accelerated government spending. The credit growth guidance of 8-10 percent year-on-year and Cost of Credit around 1 percent remain unchanged.",

The profit increase was driven by a 41 percent year-on-year reduction in provision expenses in Q2 and a 42 percent year-on-year reduction over the first half, with Cost of Credit falling to 7.8 percent in Q2 2025 (versus 12.7 percent in Q2 2024 and 8.5 percent in Q1 2025) and 8.2 percent for the first half (versus 13.3 percent in the first half of 2024).
