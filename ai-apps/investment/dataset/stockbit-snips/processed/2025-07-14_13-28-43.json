      "content": "MSCI on Friday (11/7) announced that Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN), Petrindo Jaya Kreasi ($CUAN), and Petrosea ($PTRO) will no longer be subject to exceptional treatment and will be evaluated according to the applicable methodology (including its changes) for the August 2025 index review and thereafter. This decision follows the cancellation of the plan to implement the 'unusual market activity (UMA) and/or Special Monitoring Board (FCA) related to criterion 10' mechanism over the last 12 months as an MSCI review criterion. The plan was cancelled after MSCI received input from market participants, who considered the mechanism too strict. Market participants also provided input that the application of regulations related to the special monitoring board should be consistent with other stock markets, such as the Taiwan stock market. Instead, MSCI announced that stocks listed on the Special Monitoring Board (FCA) related to criterion 10 in the last ~4 months - namely, from the previous index review price cutoff until 3 working days before the nearest index review effective date - will not be included in the index and/or migrated between Standard and Small Cap. Key Takeaway: Based on our understanding, here are some scenarios related to UMA, suspension, FCA, and their connection to the MSCI review: 1. UMA 1st time: will still be reviewed and potentially included in the index. 2. UMA 2nd time resulting in a 1-day suspension: will still be reviewed and potentially included in the index. 3. Suspension for more than 1 day resulting in listing on the Special Monitoring Board (FCA): will not be reviewed and must wait for the next review period.",

Nevertheless, Tajani stated that he is confident that progress can be achieved in negotiations between the two parties.
