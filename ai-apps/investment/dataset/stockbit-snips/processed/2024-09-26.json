      "title": "Minor IHSG Evaluation: AMMN Weight Increases, BBRI Decreases",
      "content": "On 24 September 2024 the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) announced the results of a minor evaluation of the IHSG index for the effective period 1 October to 31 December 2024. The evaluation includes changes in the weight of several stocks in the index, with Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN) experiencing the most significant increase of +1.41 percentage points to reach a weight of 5.42%. On the other hand, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) suffered the largest decrease of -0.96 percentage points, bringing its weight down to 9.00%. To determine a stock's weight in the IHSG, BEI uses a free‑float adjusted index and applies a maximum cap of 9%. In the previous evaluation in June 2024, BBRI's weight rose from 6.75% to 9%. However, the share price increase of BBRI over the past three months caused its weight to rise to 9.96% before the September 2024 evaluation. The weight reduction for BBRI in the September evaluation was driven by the application of the 9% cap. Previously, the free‑float share count for BBRI used in the June evaluation was 60 billion shares, which corresponded to the 9% cap at that time. In the September evaluation the free‑float share count fell to 54.6 billion shares, reaching the 9% cap. Besides AMMN, the issuers with the largest weight increases in the September 2024 evaluation were AMRT (+0.20 percentage points) and BNLI (+0.12 percentage points). The issuers with the largest weight decreases after BBRI were BMRI (-0.10 percentage points) and TLKM (-0.06 percentage points). The next IHSG index evaluation will be carried out in December 2024, covering the effective period 1 January to 31 March 2024. Key Takeaway: This re‑weighting can affect investors, especially institutional investors who use the IHSG as a benchmark or passive index‑tracking funds. Since the announcement of the new index weighting on 24 September 2024, BBRI's share price has fallen about -9% as of 26 September 2024, with foreign outflows reaching 4.1 trillion rupiah. Note that some of BBRI's free‑float shares have not yet been accounted for in the IHSG weighting. Therefore, if BBRI's weight declines further due to price drops, the weighting could rise again.",

The move aims to boost the banks' capacity to support China's struggling economy.
