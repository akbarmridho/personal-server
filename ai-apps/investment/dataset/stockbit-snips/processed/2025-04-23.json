      "content": "1. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday (22 April) that he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump said he wants Powell to be more proactive in lowering interest rates. The rumor about Trump planning to dismiss Powell arose after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said last week that Trump was studying whether he could fire Powell.\n2. Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (23 April) decided to keep the BI Rate at 5.75%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5% and 6.5% respectively. The decision was in line with consensus expectations.\n3. Bank Indonesia reported that bank credit growth slowed to 9.16% year-on-year in 1Q25 (versus 10.3% YoY in the first two months of 2025), below the 2025 target range of 11-13% YoY. Investment credit grew 13.36% YoY, consumer credit 9.32% YoY, and working-capital credit 6.51% YoY. Sharia financing grew 9.18% YoY and MSME credit grew 1.95% YoY.\n4. The IMF cut its global growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 to 2.8% and 3.0% respectively, down from 3.3% for both years in the January 2025 outlook. The IMF also lowered Indonesia’s 2025-2026 growth projections to 4.7% from the previous 5.1%.\n5. President Trump said on Tuesday (22 April) that the United States will set its own terms if China does not agree to a trade deal, though he gave no further details. He added that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would be significantly reduced after a deal, but not to zero.\n6. The Malaysian Palm Oil Council said on Tuesday (22 April) that demand for crude palm oil from China and India is expected to rise because current CPO prices of 3,900 ringgit per ton are relatively reasonable compared with competing commodities. On Wednesday (23 April), Indian CPO traders told Reuters that India is increasing CPO purchases as prices are cheaper than soybean oil.\n7. Indonesia’s Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia claimed on Wednesday (23 April) that Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt will replace LG Energy Solution as the strategic investor in the joint electric-vehicle battery project with the Indonesian government. He said the project’s groundbreaking is planned for the end of 2025 and that there will be no change to the basic plan.\n8. National Economic Council member Agus Puji Prasetyono said on Tuesday (22 April) that Indonesia’s first nuclear power plant is designed with an initial capacity of two units of 250 MW each, with priority locations in West Kalimantan, Bangka-Belitung, Southeast Sulawesi and Halmahera. The plant will be directly controlled by the government with a government-to-government international partnership. The minister previously said the plant is targeted to start operating in 2030-2032.\n9. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday (22 April) that he will start reducing his involvement with the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in May 2025. The comment came as Tesla’s 1Q25 operations deteriorated, with vehicle sales down 20% YoY and net profit falling 71% YoY. BBC reported that Musk’s political involvement has triggered protests and a boycott of Tesla cars.",

      "title": "Bank Central Asia reports 1Q25 net profit up 9.8% YoY, in line with expectations",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded a net profit of 14.1 trillion rupiah in 1Q25, up 9.8% year-on-year (YoY) and 2.8% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), roughly in line with expectations (24% of the 2025 consensus estimate). Net profit growth was driven by solid operational performance: Net Interest Income (NII) rose 7% YoY and operating expenses grew only 3% YoY, resulting in Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) increasing 10% YoY. Asset quality deteriorated, raising concerns.\n\n1. Credit growth begins to moderate. Total credit grew 13% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 14% YoY in 2024), largely due to a surge in short-term money-market loans. Excluding these, credit grew about 10% YoY, approaching management’s 2025 guidance of 6-8% YoY. CASA grew 8% YoY, supporting NII growth of 7% YoY with a NIM of 5.8%, matching guidance. CASA ratio reached 82.9% in 1Q25, up both annually and quarterly. Management indicated a more cautious lending stance, expecting credit growth to moderate through 2025, offset by higher loan yields and potential loan repricing.\n\n2. Asset quality deteriorates. Non-performing loans (NPL) rose to 2% in 1Q25 (vs. 1.9% in 1Q24 and 1.8% in 4Q24). Loan-at-risk (LAR) increased to 6% quarterly (vs. 6.6% in 1Q24 and 5.3% in 4Q24). Cost of credit (CoC) reached 0.5% (vs. 0.4% in 1Q24 and -0.1% in 4Q24), above the 2025 guidance of 0.3%. The NPL rise is linked to borrowers in the textile sector, while LAR growth stems from restructuring of mineral-sector borrowers, expected to complete by 2Q25. Management considers asset quality still manageable and does not plan to raise the CoC guidance for the year.\n\n3. Planned collaboration with BP Tapera in a public-housing program. Management said the partnership will be executed cautiously and gradually. The program offers decent margins after accounting for BP Tapera subsidies, but BBCA will be selective, focusing on housing projects with good ecosystem/infrastructure. BBCA is also open to a bullion-banking program, pending careful calculation due to gold price volatility and technical readiness.\n\nKey Takeaway: BBCA’s 1Q25 performance remains solid. Investors should watch (i) the success of loan repricing to offset slower credit growth and (ii) asset-quality developments amid heightened uncertainty. Direct exposure to sectors exporting to the United States represents about 2% of total credit.",

This implies a net-profit growth of at least 84% YoY and 192% QoQ for 1Q25. The clarification followed LPPF’s plan to distribute a 2024 dividend of approximately 677.5 billion rupiah at the end of April 2025, even though cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2024 were only 399 billion rupiah. LPPF also stated that after dividend distribution, it expects to maintain positive equity in 2Q25.
