      "content": "Bank Indonesia's residential property price survey indicated that primary market residential property prices in Q3 2024 grew only +1.46% year-on-year, the slowest growth since Q4 2021. The slowdown was observed across all residential categories and was driven by higher building material costs, permitting issues, high down-payment requirements, and taxation. Sales of primary-market residential properties in Q3 2024 fell -7.14% year-on-year, also across all categories. The Minister of Manpower, Yassierli, said that the regulation on provincial minimum wages (UMP) will be released by the end of November 2024 or, at the latest, early December 2024. The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that the government will manage natural resources more wisely, including nickel, and that production growth will no longer be the benchmark for the mining industry. This comment came days after Eramet Indonesia CEO Jerome Baudelet said the company received a 2024 sales quota that was 29% lower than forecast, a measure intended to protect local miners from falling global prices. Bahlil also cited US Geological Survey data showing Indonesia's share of global nickel reserves rising from 25% in 2022-2023 to 42% in March-April 2024. Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he would impose a 25% import tariff on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% tariff on China on his first day in office, aiming to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, a move that could heighten tensions with the three largest U.S. trading partners. The Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, said Apple Inc.'s proposal to invest USD 100 million in Indonesia does not meet fairness principles, indicating that further negotiations are needed before lifting the ban on iPhone 16 sales. He compared Appleâ€™s investment of more than IDR 244 trillion in Vietnam, which supports about 1.5 million units, to the roughly IDR 1.5 trillion invested in Indonesia for about 2.5 million units. Israeli media Haaretz reported that the Israeli cabinet will meet to discuss a 60-day cease-fire agreement with Hezbollah, which would include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon and the pull-back of Hezbollah militias from the Israel-Lebanon border.",

      "title": "UNVR sells ice-cream business for IDR 7 trillion",
      "content": "Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) announced that it has signed an agreement on 22 November 2024 with PT Magnum Ice Cream Indonesia to sell its ice-cream business for IDR 7 trillion, excluding VAT. The transaction value includes a fixed-asset market value of IDR 2.55 trillion, a net book value as of September 2024 of IDR 1.99 trillion, and inventory value as of September 2024 of IDR 172.8 billion. At the signing date, the buyer had an affiliate relationship with UNVR because both ultimate parent companies are Unilever plc. However, at the time of execution and settlement, the buyer will no longer have an affiliate relationship with UNVR. UNVR stated that the divestiture is part of Unilever's global plan to separate its ice-cream business. The sale allows UNVR to realize the value of its Indonesian ice-cream assets and return that value to shareholders in the short term, while refocusing on its remaining core businesses to enhance long-term shareholder value. The transaction will be discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPS) and the Independent RUPS, although dates have not yet been announced. Further details will be disclosed together with the RUPS announcements. Key Takeaway: We view the divestiture positively. Valuation-wise, the deal reflects a premium with a price-to-book (P/BV) multiple of 3.2x, well above Campina Ice Cream's (CAMP) P/BV of 1.75x. The implied price-to-earnings (P/E) range is about 22-35x, higher than UNVR's overall FY23 P/E of 15x and the annualized 9M24 P/E of 18.2x. The divestiture could enable UNVR to focus on its core operations and generate efficiency gains, especially given recent weaker performance. UNVR may also issue a special dividend from the pre-tax profit of approximately IDR 4.8 trillion from the sale. On the downside, UNVR risks losing a business with good growth potential, but limited information on the ice-cream segment's track record prevents further comment.",

      "content": "General Manager of the Geomin Unit of Aneka Tambang (ANTM), Abdul Bari, said that the company is evaluating opportunities to acquire new gold mines both domestically and abroad. He also stated that ANTM will increase its exploration activities for nickel, gold, and bauxite over the next five years with an exploration budget of USD 723 million (approximately IDR 11.2 trillion) through 2029. The expansion is driven by a request from MIND ID to raise the company's National Resources Ownership (NRO) to 15-20% for nickel, gold, and bauxite reserves. Currently, ANTM's NRO for gold is only 0.2% of the national resource potential, while NRO for nickel and bauxite are 10% and 4% respectively.",
