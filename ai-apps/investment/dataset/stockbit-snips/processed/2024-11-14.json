      "title": "US Dollar Index Strengthens to One-Year High",
      "content": "The US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by 2.3% week-over-week to 106.9 on Thursday 14 November, marking the highest level in the past year. This caused the Indonesian rupiah to fall to 15,889 per US dollar before closing weaker by 0.76% week-over-week at 15,855 on Thursday, the weakest level since mid-August 2024. In addition to the rupiah, several other emerging-market currencies also weakened, including the Malaysian ringgit (-1.84% WoW), Thai baht (-2.32% WoW), and Philippine peso (-0.09% WoW).\n\nThe rupiah’s depreciation and that of its peers over the past week were mainly pressured by inflationary policy discourse promoted by the newly elected US President Donald Trump. As previously reported in Stockbit Snips, Trump is advocating protectionist policies. The sentiment from Trump’s victory was reinforced by the Republican trifecta win in the 2024 US elections, where the Trump-supporting party secured majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This outcome could reduce the Democratic Party’s ability to limit Trump’s policy implementation.\n\nBesides the Trump-related sentiment, the DXY rise was also influenced by a resurgence in US inflation. In October 2024, the US consumer price index rose 0.2% month-over-month and 2.6% year-over-year (September 2024: 0.2% MoM and 2.4% YoY), in line with consensus expectations. Core inflation in October 2024 remained at 0.3% MoM and 3.3% YoY, also matching consensus. These figures remain above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.\n\nThe market has begun to expect a smaller rate-cut trajectory in 2025. According to the CME FedWatch Tool on Thursday 14 November, the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 75 basis points or more by June 2025 fell from 62.7% before Trump’s win to 45.9% now. Conversely, the probability of a cut of less than 75 basis points by June 2025 rose from 37.2% to 54.1%.\n\nAlongside the rupiah’s weakness, the Indonesian capital market experienced significant foreign outflows in the past week. The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell 0.4% week-over-week to 7,215, with foreign outflows of 5.23 trillion rupiah over the last week as of Thursday 14 November. Government bond yields for the 10-year tenor rose 17 basis points week-over-week to 6.96% on Thursday, with foreign outflows of 5.83 trillion rupiah over the past week as of Tuesday 12 November.\n\nKey Takeaway: Although the market is reducing optimism for large rate cuts in 2025, we assess that clearer direction of interest-rate movement still requires waiting for the magnitude and pace of implementation and potential impact of policies advocated by Trump. The strong US dollar could limit Bank Indonesia’s room to continue cutting the BI Rate.\n\nTo mitigate volatility risk from uncertain rate-cut direction, investors may lock in yields on government bonds – especially short-term series such as PBS032 – at high and attractive levels. Additionally, the SBN Retail ST013, currently in its offering period, can be an alternative as it features a floating-rate coupon with a floor.",

However, he doubts the program can achieve a chicken meat absorption target of 1.2 million tonnes per year, as stated by the expert council of the National Campaign Team of Prabowo-Gibran. According to JPFA’s projection, absorption of chicken meat in the free nutritious meals program is likely only around 900,000 tonnes per year, and Achmad mentioned that an absorption of 400,000 tonnes already has a good impact for the company.",
