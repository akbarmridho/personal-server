      "title": "Mid-October 2025 Rotation Strategy",
      "content": "In mid-October 2025, we wrote that investors could rotate or rebalance from conglomerate stocks to blue-chip stocks - especially in the consumer and banking sectors - to manage portfolio risk-reward, considering the massive price increase of conglomerate stocks and signs of profit-taking. From the market close on October 16, 2025, until the market close on November 3, 2025, blue-chip stocks experienced a quite significant price increase, reflected in the strengthening of the LQ45 index by +8% compared to the IHSG by +2%. The Top 10 contributors to the rise in the LQ45 index during this period, along with their valuations and projected net profit growth based on consensus estimates, can be seen in the table above. We see that the price increase in blue-chip stocks is still in the early phase and has the potential to continue strengthening at least until the end of 2025, based on the following factors: The Peak of Pessimism Has Passed - In general, we see that the performance of issuers in 3Q25 was not as bad as the performance in 2Q25 from the perspective of comparison against expectations. Although some issuers still reported performance below expectations, this time the number was not as large as when the 2Q25 performance was released. We assess that this was caused by expectations already being lowered since the release of the relatively weak 2Q25 performance. As an illustration, since the release of the 2Q25 performance, consensus has cut the 2025F net profit estimates for big banks by around 1-10%. In the 3Q25 earnings call, big bank management sees better growth prospects starting from 4Q25, along with accelerating credit growth and the continuing decrease in Cost of Fund. Therefore, we see the risk of performance estimate cuts post-3Q25 tending to be limited and even potentially revised upward along with expectations of economic recovery. Signs of Economic Improvement Starting to Emerge - Several macroeconomic data released monthly are beginning to show signs of economic acceleration, such as: 1) increase in money supply (M2) and credit growth; and 2) Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI). M2 and credit - In September 2025, M2 growth reached +8% YoY, marking a growth increase for 4 consecutive months. Meanwhile, credit growth in September 2025 also increased to +7.2% YoY, marking a growth increase for 2 consecutive months. Indonesia's manufacturing PMI - S&P Global noted that the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Indonesian manufacturing in October 2025 rose to 51.2 (vs. September 2025: 50.4), marking expansion of factory activity for 3 consecutive months. According to S&P Global, the main factor for the increase in October 2025 was accelerated demand growth. BCA Business and Consumer Index - In the 3Q25 earnings call, Bank Central Asia management estimated that working capital facility utilization would increase in 4Q25, in line with expectations of economic acceleration in 4Q25 and/or preparation for Eid al-Fitr which will fall in 1Q26. Meanwhile, BCA Business Transaction Index and BCA Consumer Index data began to rise in September 2025. Return of Foreign Inflow - On October 17-November 3, 2025, the IHSG recorded a net foreign inflow of 7.2 trillion rupiah in the regular market, with only 2 out of 12 IHSG trading days recording an outflow. As a conclusion, we assess that the price increase of blue-chip stocks is still in its early phase. With the ongoing trend of economic improvement - driven by acceleration in government spending at year-end and the downward trend in interest rates - we assess that foreign inflow still has the potential to continue, which will drive further price strengthening.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated on Monday (3/11) that the central bank still sees room for further cuts in the BI Rate considering inflation and economic growth, but the timing and magnitude will be based on rupiah stability and monetary policy transmission. Regarding US interest rates, Bank Indonesia estimates The Fed will cut US interest rates 1 more time this year and 1 time in 1Q26. Bank Indonesia also projects that economic growth in 3Q25 will be higher than the previous quarter. Economists' consensus estimates Indonesia's economic growth in 3Q25 to grow stably at +5% YoY (vs. 2Q25: +5.12% YoY), based on a survey compiled by Reuters. Quarterly, economic growth is expected to slow to +1.4% QoQ (vs. 2Q25: +4.04% QoQ). This projection is based on expectations of strengthening household spending and investment supported by government policies, while exports receive a temporary boost from goods shipments before US tariffs take effect. Official data regarding Indonesia's 3Q25 economic growth will be released by BPS on Wednesday (5/11). Danantara announced on Monday (3/11) that 24 foreign companies have qualified to participate in the tender for 7 waste-to-energy projects to be held on November 6, 2025, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Environmental & Chemical Engineering, ITOCHU Corporation, Veolia Environmental Services Asia, China Everbright Environment Group, up to Chongqing Sanfeng Environment Group. Danantara's Managing Director of Investment, Stefanus Ade Hadiwidjaja, stated that the companies on the list are foreign companies. Stefanus mentioned that they prefer foreign companies to participate in the first batch of tenders because Danantara wants to find experienced operators, considering that waste-to-energy power plant (PLTSa) technology domestically is still based on gasification and not incineration. Stefanus also added that they target the winning company in the tender to cooperate with local companies, State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN), or Regional-Owned Enterprises (BUMD). Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that a special excise tariff policy for illegal cigarette producers domestically will be issued in December 2025, although he did not detail further regarding the magnitude. Previously, Purbaya stated in October 2025 that his ministry planned to create a special excise tariff for illegal cigarette producers, aimed at opening opportunities for small businesses to operate legally and pay taxes. Malaysia's palm oil stock in October 2025 is projected to increase to its highest level in the last 2 years at 2.44 million tons (+3.4% MoM, +29.1% YoY), based on a median survey of traders and analysts compiled by Bloomberg. This estimate is based on the projection of a surge in Malaysian crude palm oil production in October 2025 to 1.95 million tons (+6% MoM, +8.3% YoY), which would mark the highest production level in the last 7 years. Meanwhile, Malaysian palm oil exports in October 2025 are expected to reach only 1.47 million tons (+2.8% MoM, -15.5% YoY). Official data on production, exports, and stock of Malaysian palm oil for October 2025 will only be released by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board on November 10, 2025. OJK Chief Executive, Inarno Djajadi, stated on Monday (3/11) that they target the launch of an exchange-traded fund (ETF) for gold by the end of 2025. Inarno mentioned that gold ETFs are fundamentally no different from other ETF products, but this instrument requires the presence of a gold provider and gold custody. In this regard, OJK is discussing with Bank Syariah Indonesia ($BRIS) and PT Pegadaian. Previously, PT Pegadaian revealed its readiness as a gold provider and gold custodian for the gold ETF instrument to be launched by the IDX. Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, stated on Monday (3/11) that the government is opening the option of using the State Budget (APBN) to resolve the Whoosh high-speed train polemic regarding debt payment or operational financing. This plan is not final, as the government is still coordinating with Danantara regarding the operational financing and debt of the high-speed train. Previously, Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, stated in mid-October 2025 that his company was in discussions with stakeholders to restructure the Whoosh high-speed train project debt, with a study on the debt settlement plan targeted for completion by the end of 2025.",
