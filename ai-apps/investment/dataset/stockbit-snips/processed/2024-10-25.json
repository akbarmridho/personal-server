      "content": "AKR Corporindo (AKRA) recorded a sharp decline in net profit to 466 billion rupiah (down 31% year‑on‑year, up 14% quarter‑on‑quarter) in 3Q24. This resulted in a 9M24 net profit of only 1.5 trillion rupiah (down 14% YoY), representing just 52% of the FY24 consensus estimate. The weak net profit in 3Q24 was caused by lower revenue and weak margins. • Low recovery in the Trading and Distribution segment: Pre‑tax profit (PBT) of the Trading and Distribution segment, which contributes about 65‑75% of total AKRA PBT, fell 20% YoY over 9M24. The decline was driven by a 5% YoY drop in fuel sales volume due to RKAB permit issues in 1H24 and heavy rainfall at customer mining sites in 3Q24. Weak sales to mining customers, which normally have higher margins than manufacturing or transportation customers, led to a significant margin contraction in the segment. • Sale of 70 ha of JIIPE land in 4Q24 and downgrade of sales guidance: Management revised the 2024 JIIPE land sales guidance down from 115 ha to 100 ha after land sales reached only 32 ha in 9M24, equal to 32% of the new target and 28% of the old target. Previously, in 2Q24 AKRA had revised the guidance from 130 ha to 115 ha. Although JIIPE land sales grew 8% YoY to 32 ha in 9M24, PBT from the Industrial Estate segment fell 15% YoY. Management explained that the PBT decline was due to a fair‑value adjustment on trade receivables because of longer payment terms from clients. • No interim dividend: Management confirmed that there will be no second interim dividend for FY2024. Previously, AKRA paid an interim dividend of IDR 50 per share in August 2024. In FY2023, AKRA paid two interim dividends of IDR 50 per share in August 2023 and IDR 25 per share in November 2023. Key Takeaway: With the weak results, AKRA again lowered its FY2024 net profit guidance from a range of +4‑7% YoY to -14% YoY, or about IDR 2.4 trillion, comparable to FY2022. Consensus is expected to cut AKRA performance estimates further. Over the past three months, consensus has reduced the FY24 net profit estimate by 8% to IDR 2.8 trillion. The net profit decline is expected to lower the FY2024 dividend payout ratio below the FY2023 level of 90%, as AKRA still needs capex for a tank terminal in Morowali and development of the JIIPE industrial zone.",
