      "title": "BBNI FY24: Net Income +2.7% YoY, Below Expectation",
      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) recorded a net income of 5.2 trillion rupiah in 4Q24 (-8.2% QoQ, -0% YoY). This result brought the net income for FY24 to grow to 21.5 trillion rupiah (+2.7% YoY), slightly below expectations as it reached 97.2% of the FY24F consensus estimate. BBNI's positive performance in FY24 was driven by: 1) Solid Net Interest Margin (NIM); 2) Maintained credit cost (CoC) and asset quality; and 3) Strong credit growth amidst liquidity challenges. NIM Solid, FY25 NIM Target Around 4-4.2%. Bank-only NIM in 4Q24 increased to the level of 4.5%, so FY24 NIM was at the level of 4.2% and exceeded management's FY24 guidance aiming for >4%. Management explained that the strong NIM in 4Q24 was mainly supported by the distribution of People's Business Credit (KUR). Excluding KUR, the company's core NIM was at the level of 4.2% in 4Q24. The achievement of NIM in 4Q24 was driven by a bank-only loan yield increase of about +20 bps QoQ, while the bank-only cost of fund (CoF) rose by +5 bps QoQ along with the increase in CASA and deposit CoF. BBNI management targets FY25 NIM around 4-4.2%, with expectations that NIM will tend to weaken during 1H25 before strengthening in 2H25. This expectation is based on tight liquidity projections in 1H25, before improving in 2H25. CoC and Asset Quality Maintained, FY25 CoC Target at ±1%. Bank-only CoC in 4Q24 swelled to the level of 1.5%, although CoC remained maintained at 1.1% during FY24 and in line with management's FY24 guidance aiming for ±1%. The swelling of CoC in 4Q24 was caused by: 1) additional provisions booked for the Sri Rejeki Isman (SRIL) group; and 2) conservative strategy by management for the MSME segment buffer. On the other hand, there was an improvement in bank-only asset quality, with Loan at Risk (LAR) decreasing to 10.3% and Gross Non-Performing Loan (NPL) maintained at the level of 2%. BBNI management targets CoC at the level of ±1% in FY25. Strong Credit Growth During 2024 Amidst Liquidity Challenges. Credit growth in FY24 reached +11.6% YoY (vs. FY23: +7.6% YoY), in accordance with management's FY24 guidance of +10-12%. BBNI management explained that the strengthening credit growth was driven by the corporate segment (+17.6% YoY), amidst the contraction of the KUR segment (-25% YoY). On the other hand, BBNI's liquidity continued to tighten, with bank-only Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) rising to 96.1% in FY24 (vs. FY23: 85.8%). BBNI management acknowledged the heavy liquidity challenge due to high SRBI yields and outstanding balances. Management explained that even with the Bank Indonesia interest rate cuts, liquidity will still be challenging. However, management believes that liquidity can be maintained through: 1) CASA growth via the Wondr application; 2) the latest revision of DHE SDA; and 3) increased minimum obligatory giro incentives. BBNI management targets credit growth in FY25 in the range of +8-10%, lower than Bank Indonesia's banking credit growth target of +11-13%. Key Takeaway. We assess BBNI's performance in FY24 as neutral. We view the NIM performance exceeding guidance as a positive aspect of BBNI's performance in 4Q24, considering NIM was a concern in BBNI's 1H24 performance. Looking ahead, the challenge in FY25 is focused more on the liquidity aspect, which can affect CoF and NIM. The upside catalysts for liquidity going forward can be driven by: 1) increased policy incentives, such as lowering minimum obligatory giro or DHE SDA; 2) lowering the benchmark interest rate; and 3) a decrease in SRBI yield and outstanding balances. For additional information, BBNI management also plans to propose a dividend payout ratio (DPR) for the 2024 fiscal year in the range of 50-60% (vs. 2023: 50%), indicating a dividend yield of about 6-7.2% based on the stock price on Wednesday (22/1) at the level of 4,790 rupiah per share.",
