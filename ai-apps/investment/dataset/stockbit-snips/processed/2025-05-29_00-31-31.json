      "content": "Entering mid-May 2025, more issuers have held their EGMs and set dividend distributions for the 2024 fiscal year. Stockbit has summarized a list of issuers that will distribute dividends, with the criteria that the cum date is yet to come and the yield is a minimum of 4% as of the market close today, Wednesday (28/5). Here is the detail:Based on the table above, generally issuers set the dividend payout ratio (DPR) for the 2024 fiscal year which is relatively stable compared to the 2023 fiscal year. However, we see a tendency for an increase in DPR from state-owned issuers, such as TLKM and the group of state-owned banks like BMRI (2024: 78%, 2023: 60%), BBRI (2024: 86%, 2023: 80%), BBNI (2024: 65%, 2023: 50%) and BBTN (2024: 25%, 2023: 20%) along with the formation and transfer of State-Owned Enterprises to BPI Danantara. PTBA becomes an attractive SOE issuer whose dividend is awaited soon, as the company will hold its EGM on June 12, 2025.",

      "content": "1. Bloomberg reported that the founder of Bridgewater Associates, Ray Dalio, chose not to become an advisory member of BPI Danantara for unknown reasons. This Bloomberg report came only 2 months after several government officials announced plans for Dalio's involvement in the BPI Danantara advisory board. Meanwhile, the CEO of BPI Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, denied this news. 2. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, claimed that Indonesia's gas lifting reached 1,206 mboepd in 1Q25, equivalent to 120% of the 2025 State Budget target. Meanwhile, oil lifting reached 580,000 bpd in 1Q25, equivalent to 96% of the 2025 State Budget target. 3. The Consumer Confidence Index (IKK) in the US rose 12.3 points to level 98 in May 2025, exceeding the consensus expectation of 87 points. This result marks the first IKK increase in the US after falling consecutively for the last 5 months due to the escalation of the trade war between the US and China. 4. German Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, opened the possibility that the German government might not export weapons to Israel if Israel continues to attack Palestine. Reuters reported that Johann's statement marks a significant shift in tone for Germany towards Israel, which is known as one of Israel's supporters through its Staatsraison commitment. Besides Germany, the European Union is also reviewing its policy towards Israel, while the UK, France, and Canada threaten concrete actions over the ongoing Israeli attacks on Palestine. 5. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday (27/5) condemned US President Donald Trump's tariff plan because it created uncertainty in trade and highlighted the urgency of trade diversification. The US is the largest export customer in Southeast Asia. ASEAN stated it will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the US and is committed to not imposing retaliatory measures against the US. Bloomberg also reported that ASEAN implied concerns regarding the risk of their markets being flooded by Chinese goods originally intended for export to the US. 6. The House of Representatives (DPR) has received proposed names for Deputy Governor candidates of Bank Indonesia for the 2025-2030 period, with President Prabowo Subianto proposing Dicky Kartikoyono and Ricky Perdana Gozali. Currently, Dicky serves as the Head of Bank Indonesia's Payment System Policy Department, while Ricky serves as the Head of Bank Indonesia's DKI Jakarta Representative Office. The Vice Chairman of Commission XI DPR, Fauzi Amro, said that the discussion on these two candidates will take place after the DPR recess period ends, which is estimated to be in July 2025. 7. Minister of Housing and Settlement Areas, Maruarar Sirait, said on Tuesday (27/5) that the government has approved the addition of the subsidized mortgage (KPR) quota for 2025 from 220,000 units to 350,000 units. The regulation regarding this quota upgrade will be issued soon. Maruarar added that the state-owned bank group (Himbara) has committed to channeling 85% of this total quota. BP Tapera Commissioner, Heru Pudyo Nugroho, stated that the addition of the subsidized mortgage quota increases managed funds by 16.4 trillion rupiah to around 34.4 trillion rupiah.",
