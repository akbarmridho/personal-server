      "title": "MSCI: Barito Renewables Energy, Petrindo Jaya Kreasi, and Petrosea Not Included in May 2025 Review",
      "content": "MSCI on Friday (April 11) announced that Barito Renewables Energy (BREN), Petrindo Jaya Kreasi (CUAN), and Petrosea (PTRO) will remain excluded from the inclusion list in the May 2025 index review. The announcement is an update after MSCI opened a consultation period for market participants and investors regarding the investability of the three stocks. Previously, MSCI had decided that BREN, CUAN, and PTRO would not be added to the MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index in the February 2025 review due to potential investability constraints. In the Friday announcement, MSCI also explained that it is examining the addition of a rule whereby stocks listed on the IDX that have been subject to an Unusual Market Activity (UMA) announcement or placed on a monitoring board within the past 12 months because of abnormal price movements would not be considered for inclusion in the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. MSCI will accept input on the rule change until June 20, 2025, with an update to be released on July 11, 2025. For reference, the last dates that BREN, CUAN, and PTRO received a UMA or were placed on a monitoring board are: BREN – June 20, 2024 (last trading day on a special monitoring board); CUAN – January 8, 2025 (UMA); PTRO – September 4, 2024 (UMA). Following MSCI's announcement, the closing prices on Monday (April 14) were up +9.71% for BREN, +7.5% for CUAN, and +4% for PTRO. The precedent set by these three stocks, together with the potential new rule on UMA and special monitoring boards, could make it more difficult for a stock to qualify for inclusion in MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. If implemented, the rule would increase regulator influence – specifically the IDX – in determining a stock's eligibility for MSCI indices.",
