The result lifted full-year 2024 net profit to IDR 54.8 trillion, a 12.7% year-on-year increase and exactly 100% of the FY24 consensus estimate. The performance was supported by: (1) Net Interest Margin (NIM) in the upper part of the guidance range; (2) credit cost (CoC) in line with guidance as asset quality remained sound; and (3) credit growth that exceeded guidance. NIM for the bank-only segment rose to 6% in 4Q24, putting FY24 NIM at 5.8% within the upper guidance range of 5.7-5.8% after an upgrade. Management targets FY25 NIM of 5.7-5.8%. CoC for the bank-only segment was –0.1% in 4Q24, resulting in a FY24 CoC of 0.3% in line with the 0.3-0.4% guidance; asset quality stayed strong with gross NPL at 1.8% and loan-at-risk at 5.3%. Management targets FY25 CoC to remain at 0.3%. Credit growth in FY24 was stable at +13.8% year-on-year (versus +13.9% in FY23) and beat the upgraded guidance of +10-12%. Credit growth was driven by corporate-segment loans that rose 15.7% year-on-year, mainly from investment-grade loans. Management targets a moderate credit-growth pace of +6-8% in FY25.",
