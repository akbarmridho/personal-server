      "title": "The Fed Indicates Delay in US Rate Cuts, Rupiah Weakens",
      "content": "The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that the start of U.S. interest rate cuts will take longer than expected as inflation remains above forecasts and the labor market stays strong. Powell also said that if inflation pressure continues, the Fed may keep rates unchanged for as long as needed.\n\nIn March 2024, the United States recorded inflation of 3.5% year-over-year (versus February 2024: 3.2%), exceeding the consensus expectation of 3.4%. This marks the third consecutive month that inflation has been higher than expected.\n\nThe inflation pressure reinforces the narrative that U.S. rates will stay at a high level for a longer period (“higher for longer”). According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a Fed rate cut at the June 2024 meeting fell sharply from 61.1% on 2 April 2024 to 15.2% on 17 April 2024.\n\nThe market currently expects the Fed to begin cutting rates only in Q3 2024, with only one to two cuts throughout the year. Previously, the Fed projected three rate cuts in 2024.\n\nThe “higher for longer” narrative also affected Indonesia, with the rupiah weakening to as low as 16,300 per US dollar on the morning of Wednesday 17 April. Bank Indonesia intervened in the spot and non-deliverable forward markets to maintain exchange-rate stability.\n\nIn October 2023, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly raised the BI Rate by 25 basis points after the rupiah fell to 15,860, the weakest level since April 2020.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe Fed’s signal to postpone U.S. rate cuts could lower expectations for a BI Rate cut. Bloomberg-surveyed economists still project that Bank Indonesia will start cutting its policy rate in Q3 2024.\n\nThe “higher for longer” narrative may negatively impact interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as banking, property, and technology. Conversely, a stronger US dollar could benefit exporters such as ITMG, ADRO, INKP, TKIM, MYOR, and ICBP.\n\nIndonesian government bond yields also rose as expectations of sustained high rates persisted, with the 10-year sovereign yield up 58 basis points year-to-date. Investors may lock in more attractive yields on FR bonds held to maturity, for example FR0097 which yielded 7.05% per annum as of 17 April 2024. FR bonds can be purchased via Bibit.",
