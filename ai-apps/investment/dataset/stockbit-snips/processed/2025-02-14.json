US Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick said all studies related to the retaliatory tariffs will be completed by 1 April 2025, allowing Trump to act immediately thereafter. Bloomberg reported that the retaliatory tariffs will be adjusted for each country to offset tariffs imposed by those partners on US exports. The consideration also covers non‑tariff barriers such as unfair subsidies, regulations, value‑added tax, exchange rates, and lax intellectual‑property protection. Trump also said he would levy higher import duties on automobiles, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals.",

      "content": "Unilever Indonesia ($UNVR) recorded a net profit of IDR 359 billion in 4Q24 (‑41% YoY, ‑34% QoQ), lower than the net profit in 4Q23 when boycott sentiment peaked. This resulted in a full‑year 2024 net profit of IDR 3.4 trillion (‑30% YoY), below expectations as it met only 90% of the consensus estimate. The ongoing restructuring program remains the main factor pressuring short‑term performance. Sales were hit by a decision to reduce stock at the distributor level, while profitability fell due to transformation costs. Gross margin stayed low at around 45% in the last two quarters (versus the normal 49‑50%) because of lower sales and transformation expenses. In 4Q24, UNVR also recorded one‑off costs related to employee reductions, causing operating salary expenses to surge, with 'Selling & Marketing' up +110% YoY (+67% QoQ) and 'General & Administrative' up +55% YoY (+170% QoQ). Management expects the restructuring program to continue into 1H25, so performance will still be weighed down, though the impact will be less severe than in 4Q24. Positive results from the program are expected to become visible in 2H25. With UNVR share price strengthening by +2.91% on Thursday (13/2) and +3.53% on Friday (14/2), the market responded positively to management's view that the worst performance has passed and future outlook is improving. Progress of the restructuring program should be closely monitored as it will be a key factor in UNVR stock recovery.",
