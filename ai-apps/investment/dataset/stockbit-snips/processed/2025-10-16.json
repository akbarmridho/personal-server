      "title": "Government Releases New Waste-to-Energy Regulation",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto has issued Presidential Regulation No. 109/2025 concerning the processing of waste into electricity (PSEL or waste-to-energy) on 10 October 2025. The new regulation has several important changes compared to the previous regulation, Presidential Regulation No. 35/2018. Key differences include: Increase in the electricity purchase price by PLN. The new regulation sets the purchase price for electricity from PSEL operators to PLN at 20 US cents per kWh for all capacities, up from the previous range of approximately 13 US cents per kWh depending on PSEL capacity. Contract duration of 30 years. The new regulation defines a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) period for electricity sales from PSEL operators to PLN, starting when the PSEL reaches commercial operation. Previously, no contract duration was stipulated. Elimination of the tipping fee. The higher electricity purchase price is accompanied by the removal of the waste management fee (tipping fee). Previously, operators received a maximum tipping fee of IDR 500,000 per ton of waste as compensation for waste processing services. The regulation also defines the role of Danantara in PSEL projects: selecting the business entity that will develop and manage the PSEL, and investing in the commercial, financial, and risk-management aspects of the PSEL. PSEL operators can be formed through cooperation between local governments and state-owned enterprises (BUMN), regional-owned enterprises (BUMD), or private parties. Danantara CEO Rosan Perkasa Roeslani claimed on Thursday (16/10) that there are already 107 prospective waste-to-energy investors in Indonesia, with 53 domestic and 54 foreign investors. According to analysis by the Ministry of Environment, ten cities are ready to implement the projects: Jakarta, Tangerang, Bekasi, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Bali and Makassar. Key Takeaway: The new revenue scheme – higher purchase price from PLN but no tipping fee – together with a long-term electricity sales contract provides greater business certainty and improves the financial viability of PSEL projects. On the Indonesia Stock Exchange, several issuers already have or plan exposure to the waste-to-energy industry or its ecosystem, such as $TOBA, $OASA, $MHKI, $HGII, and $BIPI.",

      "content": "Indonesian government bond yields for the 10-year tenor fell by 6.6 basis points to 5.956% on Thursday (16/10), marking the lowest level since January 2021. The yield decline was driven by expectations of interest-rate cuts and strong domestic demand for sovereign bonds. President Prabowo Subianto said on Wednesday (15/10) that he has instructed Danantara to reduce the number of state-owned enterprises (BUMN) from around 1,000 to about 200. He also noted that regulations have been changed to allow expatriates and non-Indonesians to lead BUMN.
