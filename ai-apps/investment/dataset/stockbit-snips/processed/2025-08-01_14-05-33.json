      "title": "Poultry 2Q25: Pressured by Broiler and DOC Prices",
      "content": "Japfa Comfeed Indonesia ($JPFA), Charoen Pokphand Indonesia ($CPIN), and Malindo Feedmill ($MAIN) recorded pressured performance throughout 2Q25, alongside a sharp decline in broiler and DOC prices amid demand that had not yet recovered. JPFA emerged as the best performer this quarter, while CPIN and MAIN experienced significant corrections, even recording operational losses in several lines. These results align with our previous outlook that the absence of the festive season (Eid) and the historical effect of the month of Suro potentially suppressed poultry prices. 1. JPFA: Net profit dropped in 2Q25 (-18% QoQ, -32% YoY), resulting in a 1H25 year-over-year decline of -16% and below expectations (43%/40% of 2025F Stockbit/Consensus estimates). 2. CPIN: Net profit plummeted in 2Q25 (-76% QoQ, -66% YoY), making the 1H25 realization grow +7% YoY and below expectations (42%/45% of 2025F Stockbit/Consensus estimates). 3. MAIN: Recorded its first quarterly loss since 1Q23 and a net profit decline of -91% YoY in 1H25. Here are some key highlights of the 2Q25 performance for the three issuers: 'Broiler' Segment: Only JPFA Remained Profitable JPFA recorded operating profit in the 'Broiler' segment of 292 billion Rupiah in 2Q25 (+14% QoQ), despite broiler prices plunging to 16,326 Rupiah per kg (-15% QoQ). Meanwhile, CPIN - historically the strongest - actually recorded an operating loss of 130 billion Rupiah, while MAIN recorded a loss of 77 billion Rupiah. 'DOC' Segment Weakened Simultaneously DOC prices fell to 4,196 Rupiah per head (-24% QoQ), causing all three issuers to record operating losses in this segment in 2Q25. JPFA remained the most resilient with a loss of 13 billion Rupiah, followed by MAIN with a loss of 45 billion Rupiah, while CPIN experienced the deepest loss of 197 billion Rupiah. Pressure Spreads to the 'Processed Chicken' Segment The 'Processed Chicken' segment was also pressured. Although JPFA and MAIN recorded year-over-year revenue growth in 2Q25, JPFA's operating profit weakened to 79 billion Rupiah (-36% YoY) and MAIN recorded another loss of 12 billion Rupiah (vs. 2Q24: loss of 14 billion Rupiah). Meanwhile, CPIN recorded a revenue decline of -17% QoQ and operating profit fell drastically to 46 billion Rupiah, after having posted a profit of 331 billion Rupiah in 1Q25. Key Takeaway With poultry price trends not yet recovering significantly amid still weak demand, we assess that acceleration of government spending is needed to boost demand and drive further price recovery in 2H25. In the medium to long term, the implementation of the Free Nutritious Meal program has the potential to structurally increase demand, if chicken products are included as part of the program. Since the release of CPIN and JPFA results on Thursday (31/7) afternoon, JPFA's stock price rose +5.31% and CPIN fell -3.25% on Friday (1/8). MAIN - which released its results on Thursday (31/7) morning - had already experienced a stock price decline of -8.8% until Friday (1/8). JPFA's stock outperformance can be attributed to its relatively most resilient performance compared to peers. MAIN itself will hold an earnings call on Friday (8/8) morning.",

The decrease in the cost of revenue was primarily driven by inventory value movements, resulting in lower average selling costs in 2Q25.
