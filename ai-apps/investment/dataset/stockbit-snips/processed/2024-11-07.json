      "content": "XL Axiata (EXCL) recorded net profit of 292 billion rupiah (-16% YoY, -40% QoQ) in 3Q24. This makes net profit for 9M24 1.3 trillion rupiah (+32% YoY), below expectations as only 70% of FY24F consensus estimate. The decline in EXCL performance in 3Q24 is very weak, given consensus did not raise FY24F net profit expectations significantly and EXCL recorded performance exceeding consensus (57% of FY24F estimate) in 1H24. Operationally, EXCL operating profit in 3Q24 reached 1.3 trillion rupiah (+11% YoY, -9% QoQ), so operating profit for 9M24 became 4.1 trillion rupiah (+26% YoY) and slightly above expectations at 76% of FY24F consensus estimate. Net profit decline in 3Q24 was pressured by other expenses rising sharply to 132 billion rupiah (vs 2Q24: 11 billion, 3Q23: 19 billion). Management explained increase came from one-off costs related to integration of fixed broadband business from Link Net (LINK) completed on 29 Sep 2024 about 100 billion rupiah. Additionally, JV loss in 3Q24 increased to 124 billion rupiah (vs 2Q24 loss 51 billion, 3Q23 loss 37 billion) caused by higher losses from LINK and Princeton Digital Group Data Center. Mobile subscriber count in 3Q24 slightly increased (+2% YoY, +0.2% QoQ), but ARPU fell significantly (-2% YoY, -7% QoQ) to 41,000 rupiah. ARPU decline aligns with industry trend: Telkom Indonesia (TLKM) ARPU 43.1k rupiah (-11% YoY, -4% QoQ) and Indosat (ISAT) ARPU 37.2k rupiah (+2% YoY, -3% QoQ). EXCL ARPU remains second largest in Indonesia in 3Q24. Management says ARPU decline due to weakening purchasing power and tighter competition as rivals sell cheaper packages. Also dual SIM usage increased, with users buying cheaper provider packages. Integration of LINK completed end of 3Q24, additional impact on net profit will be fully felt in 4Q24. Management cannot yet quantify additional profit from fixed broadband. They will develop fixed broadband via cross conversion strategy: selling XL mobile packages to First Media customers and First Media content packages to XL Home customers. Due diligence on merger with Smartfren Telecom (FREN) near completion; finalization depends on regulator approval. Key Takeaway: Need signs of bottoming in ARPU driven by price increases before positive stock trend. Investors should watch merger progress with FREN and additional income from LINK fixed broadband.",
