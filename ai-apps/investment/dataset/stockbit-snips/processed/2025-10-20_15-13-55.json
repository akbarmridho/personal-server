      "content": "Bank Central Asia ($BBCA) recorded net profit of 14.4 trillion rupiah in 3Q25 (+1% YoY, -3% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 9M25 to 43.4 trillion rupiah (+6% YoY), in line with expectations as it equals 75% of the consensus 2025F estimate (vs. 9M24: 75% realization in 2024). In general, BBCA's performance in 3Q25 was relatively in line with the monthly performance during the July-August 2025 period which we have written about, where the company was more cautious in extending credit and increasing provisions as a proactive measure. However, in the 3Q25 earnings call, we assessed that BBCA management tended to be more optimistic entering 4Q25 and 2026 generally, along with the prospect of macroeconomic improvement driven by increased government spending and the trend of declining interest rates.",

Cost of Credit (CoC) is expected to be at the level of 0.5% by the end of 2025, which implies that CoC in 4Q25 will be lower than the position in 3Q25 which was at the level of 0.6%. The potential for lower CoC in 4Q25 is possible when looking at the trend of quarterly declining NPL in 3Q25, after rising sequentially in 1Q25 and 2Q25. For 2026, although no official guidance has been provided, BBCA management indicated that credit growth has the potential to be faster, possibly in the range of +8-10%. The potential for stronger loan volume growth and CASA, along with better asset quality, is expected to outweigh the impact of potential loan yield decline due to falling interest rates. BBCA management itself sees Bank Indonesia potentially cutting interest rates 1x until the end of 2025 and 3x during 2026.",

In addition, BBCA management mentioned that they are still discussing the dividend distribution portion for the 2025 fiscal year.
