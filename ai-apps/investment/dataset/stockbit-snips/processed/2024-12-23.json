      "title": "Export Tariff on Crude Palm Oil Increases to 10% Starting 2025",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said the government will raise the export levy on crude palm oil (CPO) from 7.5% to 10% starting January 2025. The increase is intended to support the B40 program, which aims to use 40% biofuel (BBN) for biodiesel and is also planned to start in early 2025. Meanwhile, the export levy for other palm oil products will be set at a minimum of 4.5%, previously ranging between 3% and 6%.\n\nThe decision comes only three months after the government lowered and simplified the CPO export levy scheme from a progressive system to a single tariff of 7.5%.\n\nThe government targets biodiesel distribution of 15.6 million kiloliters (KL) in 2025, up from the 2024 target of 13.4 million KL, due to increased BBN blending. According to Eddy Abdurrachman, President Director of the Palm Oil Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS), the estimated subsidy fund needed for biodiesel is projected to reach 47 trillion rupiah in 2025. This estimate was given in early November 2024 when CPO prices were around 4,900 Malaysian ringgit per ton.\n\nEddy disclosed that the funds managed by BPDPKS remain sufficient to support the B40 program next year if supplemented by projected revenues in 2025. By the end of 2024, the BPDPKS fund balance was estimated at 31.8 trillion rupiah, while projected palm oil export revenue for 2025 was 20.3 trillion rupiah under the existing tariff. Using the new tariff, palm oil export revenue could reach 27.1 trillion rupiah.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe biodiesel subsidy fund requirement will depend on how quickly the full B40 program is implemented and on movements in CPO and diesel prices. A higher export levy will increase certainty for the B40 program in the coming years. However, given the current revenue and expenditure run-rate, the biodiesel program could become unsustainable in the long term, especially if the government seeks to raise blending to 50% (B50). On the other hand, the higher CPO export levy could reduce CPO competitiveness compared with other vegetable oils, potentially lowering demand.\n\nOn Monday trading (23/12), CPO prices rose 2.6% to 4,548 Malaysian ringgit per ton.",
