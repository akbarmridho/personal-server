      "title": "Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariff, China Responds",
      "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump announced on 2 April 2025 a reciprocal tariff policy with a minimum rate of 10% on all imports into the United States. In addition, higher tariffs will be applied to 57 countries that are the sources of the U.S. trade deficit. The minimum 10% reciprocal tariff will take effect on 5 April 2025, while the higher tariffs for the 57 countries will start on 9 April 2025. The reciprocal tariff is added on top of any existing import duties. For example, the total tariff on China as of 9 April 2025 will be 54%, consisting of a 34% reciprocal tariff plus an existing 20% duty. Mexico and Canada are exempt from the reciprocal tariff. Certain commodities are also exempt, including semiconductors, copper, medical goods and pharmaceuticals. Two days later, on 4 April 2025, China announced it would impose an additional 34% tariff on all U.S. products, effective 10 April 2025, and would restrict rare-earth exports to the United States starting 4 April 2025. In response, President Trump warned that the United States would impose an additional 50% tariff on China if Beijing does not cancel its reciprocal measures. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said it would fight to the end to protect national interests. The European Union has also proposed a 25% counter-tariff on certain U.S. imports, scheduled to take effect on 16 May 2025. The Indonesian government said it will not take retaliatory steps and will pursue diplomatic negotiations. Indonesia will send a delegation, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani, to trade talks in the United States next week. The United States is Indonesia’s second-largest export destination after China, with exports worth USD 26.3 billion in 2024 (about 10 % of total exports and roughly 2 % of Indonesia’s GDP). The top five U.S. imports from Indonesia in 2024 were: 1) electrical machinery and equipment (e.g., cables and modems); 2) apparel and accessories (knit and non-knit); 3) footwear; 4) animal and vegetable oils (e.g., palm oil); and 5) rubber and rubber products (e.g., tires). On Tuesday, 8 April, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell 7.9 %, the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose about 8 basis points to 7.08 %, and the rupiah weakened 1.9 % to IDR 16,865 per USD, marking a historic low. From 2-7 April 2025, the S&P 500 dropped 10.7 %, the Nasdaq fell 11.4 % and the EIDO fell 7.2 %. Asian markets also declined from 2-8 April: the Nikkei 225 fell 7.6 %, the Shanghai Composite fell 6.1 % and the Hang Seng Index fell 13.3 %.",
