      "title": "U.S. House Passes Tax and Spending Bill for Trump Cabinet, Dollar Weakens",
      "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives, controlled by the Republican Party on Thursday (May 22), passed the tax and spending bill for President Donald Trump's cabinet. The bill will fulfill many of Trump's populist campaign promises, such as tax cuts for individuals and corporations, increased military spending, border law enforcement, and ending clean-energy incentives from the Biden era. After being approved by the House, the tax and spending bill will be sent to the U.S. Senate – also controlled by the Republican Party – for final enactment. The bill is expected to add about $3.8 trillion to U.S. government debt over the next decade, raising investor concerns about U.S. solvency. Last week, Moody's downgraded the United States' sovereign credit rating from Aaa with a negative outlook to Aa1 with a stable outlook, marking the first Moody's downgrade of the U.S. since 1917. Prior to Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's also downgraded U.S. debt in 2023 and 2021 respectively. Currently, U.S. government debt stands at 36.2 trillion rupiah. Interest payments on U.S. debt accounted for 12.5% of total U.S. expenditures in 2024 and are projected to rise to 16.7% within the next ten years. Concerns about U.S. debt again pressured the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which fell 0.6% to 99.36 in today’s trade on Friday (May 23). Since the start of the year, the DXY has weakened 8.4% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield remained flat at 4.528% today. Domestically, the Indonesian rupiah strengthened 0.67% to 16,217 per USD and the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rose 0.66% to 7,214.16, supported by a foreign inflow of 589 billion rupiah today. The 10-year Indonesian government bond yield fell 2 basis points to 6.828%. Key Takeaway: The weakening trend of the U.S. dollar is projected to push the rupiah stronger, potentially below 16,000 by Q4 2025, which could be followed by continued foreign inflows into the IHSG. An IHSG rise driven by foreign inflows is expected to benefit the Big 4 banks – BBCA, BMRI, BBNI, BBRI. A stronger rupiah will also positively affect issuers with large import or U.S. dollar-denominated debt exposure, such as ICBP, KLBF, and MAPI.",
