      "title": "Gold Price All-Time High, Breaks US$3,500/oz",
      "content": "The gold price in the spot market hit a new all-time high record of 3,508.73 US dollars per troy ounce in intraday trading today, Tuesday (2/9), although it later weakened to the level of 3,483.76 US dollars per troy ounce as of Tuesday afternoon. This marks a +2.56% increase in gold prices over the last 1 week and +32.7% since the beginning of the year (YTD), simultaneously surpassing the previous all-time high record recorded in April 2025. This gold price rally is driven by several factors, namely: 1) strengthening expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut; 2) the continuation of the de-dollarization trend; and 3) still high geopolitical and macro-economic uncertainty. Based on analysis from CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of an AS interest rate cut at the September 2025 meeting reached 91.8% as of today, up from the level of 87.8% a week ago. Investor concerns regarding the independence of the Fed - following pressure from President Trump on the Fed head and the issue of firing Fed official, Lisa Cook - are also eroding investor confidence in the US dollar. Investors are also concerned that inflation may rise if US interest rate cuts are made due to political pressure. According to the Senior Commodity Strategist at ANZ, Daniel Hynes, current gold demand is increasing, driven by investor concerns over the risk of rising inflation due to interest rate cuts. Amidst the strengthening gold price, the US Dollar Index (DXY) has weakened by -9.3% YTD to the level of 98.37 as of Tuesday (2/9).",

      "title": "KLBF Plans Share Buyback Up to IDR250 Billion",
      "content": "1. KLBF: Kalbe Farma plans to execute a share buyback with an allocation of funds up to 250 billion rupiah in the period of September 4 - December 3, 2025. The company did not specify the number of shares to be repurchased or the execution price. This plan does not require AGM approval, in line with the relief granted by the OJK to support capital market stability. 2. BBCA: The President Commissioner of Bank Central Asia, Jahja Setiaatmadja, purchased 62,500 BBCA shares at an average price of 7,975 rupiah per share on September 1, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 498 million rupiah. After this transaction, Jahja Setiaatmadja's direct ownership portion in BBCA did not change significantly and remains around 0.03%. 3. BNGA: Bank CIMB Niaga recorded bank-only net profit of 443 billion rupiah in July 2025 (-22% YoY, -28% MoM). This result caused the bank-only net profit for 7M25 to decrease to 3.8 trillion rupiah (-2% YoY), equivalent to 54% of the consensus 2025F consolidation estimate (vs. 7M24: 57% realization of annual consolidated net profit). The decline in net profit in July 2025 was caused by the weakening of Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) by -4% YoY and a surge in provision expenses by +236% YoY. PPOP also fell -7% YoY during 7M25, even though net profit during 7M25 only dropped slightly (-2% YoY) thanks to a decrease in provision expenses by -25% YoY. Meanwhile, credit growth slowed to +4% YoY as of July 2025 (vs. June 2025: +6% YoY, March 2025: +7% YoY). 4. CITA: Cita Mineral Investindo announced that its business entity, PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry, has issued new shares worth approximately 1.9 trillion rupiah, aimed at supporting the development of the aluminum smelter project. In this corporate action, CITA injected capital of approximately 237 billion rupiah and its ownership stake in PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry remained unchanged at 12.5%. Besides CITA, the existing shareholders of PT Kalimantan Aluminium Industry consist of the subsidiary of Alamtri Minerals Indonesia (ADMR), PT Alamtri Indo Aluminium, with an ownership of 65%, and Aumay Mining Pte. Ltd. with an ownership of 22.5%. CITA stated that PT Alamtri Indo Aluminium and Aumay Mining Pte. Ltd. also participated in subscribing to the new shares according to their respective ownership portions. 5. NISP: Bank OCBC NISP recorded bank-only net profit of 445 billion rupiah in July 2025 (-49% YoY, +2% MoM), resulting in the bank-only net profit for 7M25 dropping -8% YoY to 3 trillion rupiah (vs. 1H25: +7% YoY). The decline in net profit in July 2025 was caused by weakening Non-Interest Income by -71% YoY due to a high-base effect from investment gains (2 billion rupiah vs. July 2024: 527 billion rupiah). Meanwhile, net profit during 7M25 was suppressed by provision expenses recorded at 66 billion rupiah (vs. 7M24 provision expense reversal: 491 billion rupiah). Furthermore, the Net Interest Margin (NIM) contracted to 4.1% in 7M25 (vs. 7M24: 4.6%).",
