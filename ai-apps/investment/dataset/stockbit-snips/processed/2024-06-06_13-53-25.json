      "title": "Rupiah Exchange Rate Weakens Since Early June 2024, Approaching 16,300 Level",
      "content": "The rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened intraday to penetrate the 16,300 level on Thursday (6/6), marking the weakest level since April 2020, before finally closing slightly stronger by +0.02% at the 16,279 level. Since the beginning of June 2024, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar has decreased by -0.3% MTD as of Thursday (6/6). The weakening of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar occurred alongside the weakening of Indonesia's trade balance surplus due to the normalization of commodity prices, fund outflows during the Hajj season, and dividend repatriation by foreign investors investing in Indonesian companies. Since the beginning of June 2024 alone, the Indonesian capital market experienced net foreign outflow, with a net outflow in the bond market reaching 43 billion rupiah as of Tuesday (4/6) and in the stock market reaching 53 billion rupiah as of Wednesday (5/6). Although the rupiah exchange rate weakened against the US dollar since the beginning of this month, the US dollar index (DXY) actually dropped -0.6% MTD to the 104 level as of Thursday (6/6). The weakening of the DXY occurred after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job openings in the US in April 2024 reached only ~8.06 million (vs. March 2024: 8.36 million), lower than the consensus expectation of 8.36 million and marking the lowest level since February 2021. Additionally, ADP reported that the number of private company hirings in the US in May 2024 reached only 152,000 (vs. April 2024: 188,000), lower than the consensus expectation of 175,000. In line with weak US employment data, the market is now beginning to expect the Fed to start cutting US interest rates in September 2024. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed starting interest rate cuts in September 2024 reached 78.3% as of Thursday (6/6), up from 59.6% on Monday (3/6). Key Takeaway: The weakening of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar when the DXY is also weakening indicates that the rupiah's depreciation in June 2024 is not caused by a strengthening US dollar. Furthermore, even though market expectations for the start of US interest rate cuts strengthened, the weakening of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar makes the direction of the BI Rate policy uncertain, even risking an increase again. The current consensus still predicts a cut in the BI Rate in 4Q24. We assess that Bank Indonesia can implement a cut if inflation remains controlled and the rupiah exchange rate remains stable.",
