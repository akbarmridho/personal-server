      "title": "ADRO: Analysis of Spin-off AADI Scenario",
      "content": "Ahead of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPSLB) of Adaro Energy Indonesia (ticker ADRO) scheduled for 18 November 2024 and the public offering by shareholders (PUPS) of Adaro Andalan Indonesia (ticker AADI) in December 2024, we attempt to analyze the optimal option for ADRO investors regarding the corporate spin-off of AADI. There are two options for ADRO investors: 1) Participate in the AADI PUPS, which we further split into three scenarios: • Base-case scenario: implies a price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of 5x for AADI and 6.6x PE for ADRO. • Bull-case scenario: implies 5x PE for AADI and 8.9x PE for ADRO. • Bear-case scenario: implies 5x PE for AADI and 3.8x PE for ADRO. 2) Do not participate in the AADI PUPS. Option 1 – Participation in the AADI PUPS: Based on our calculations, ADRO investors who use their dividend to participate in the AADI PUPS are likely to be more advantaged because: • ADRO share price is expected to fall after the AADI spin-off and dividend distribution as net profit potential declines after the spin-off. If ADRO share price does not decline after the spin-off, ADRO could trade at a valuation of 13.3x PE. • AADI share price could be re-rated to a level of 5x PE, which we consider a more reasonable and conservative level. This 5x PE level is still below the five-year historical mean for ADRO of 6.9x PE, as well as below valuations of other coal issuers such as PTBA (7.7x PE FY24F annualized) and ITMG (6.87x PE FY24F annualized). In the long term, ADRO valuation will be influenced by market sentiment and net profit from the development of an aluminium smelter project and a hydro-electric power plant (PLTA), which are expected to become operational in 2025 and 2030 respectively.",

      "content": "Option 2 – Not participating in the AADI IPO: We see that investors who only take the dividend and do not participate in the AADI PUPS may obtain a lower return or even risk a loss compared with investors who participate in the PUPS. This is because investors who do not participate in the AADI PUPS will face a potential decline in ADRO share price without gaining the upside from a rise in AADI share price. The redemption rights for the AADI PUPS cannot be sold. Investors taking this option may lose the thermal coal business of ADRO at a valuation of 2.7x PE 1H24 annualized, lower than the five-year historical mean for ADRO and its peers. Assumptions used: • ADRO purchase price uses the Tuesday (12/11) closing price of IDR 3,820 per share. • ADRO dividend paid at the maximum level of IDR 1,352 per share. • Dividend payment is executed simultaneously with the PUPS. • AADI PUPS price equals the upper limit of the IPO price range at IDR 5,900 per share, which is also the maximum of the PUPS price range. • Allocation ratio is 100:23 (for every 100 ADRO shares, the holder receives the right to order 23 AADI shares in the PUPS). • Exchange rate IDR to USD is 15,811.",
