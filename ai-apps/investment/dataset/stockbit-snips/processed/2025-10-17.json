      "title": "IHSG Plummets -2.57% Amid Continued Correction of Conglomerate Stocks",
      "content": "The Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell 2.57% on Friday (17/10) to a level of 7,916, driven by further weakness in conglomerate stocks, with five stocks contributing to the decline: DSSA (-13.8%), BREN (-5.10%), BRPT (-7.12%), CUAN (-9.66%) and MLPT (-15%). This drop caused the IHSG to decline 4.14% over the past week.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the IHSG has still posted a gain of +11.8% year-to-date, mainly propelled by the rise in conglomerate stocks. This is reflected in the performance gap between the IHSG and indices dominated by blue-chip stocks, such as the LQ45. While the IHSG has strengthened since the start of the year, the LQ45 index has actually fallen -6.57% YTD, and the performance gap between the two indices has widened since mid-2025. However, in the past week, blue-chip stocks have begun to outperform conglomerates, with the LQ45 index declining only -2.68% compared with the IHSG's -4.14%, as profit-taking pressure on conglomerate stocks increased.\n\nRegarding the decline in bank stock prices since the start of the year, Edwin Ridwan, Director of Investment Development at BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, told Kontan that the institution has increased its equity allocation in the stock market to 10% of total assets under management (versus 6.81% in March 2025), with one of the target sectors being banking. Edwin added that the fund invests in large-cap bank stocks and is not limited to the state-owned bank consortium (Himbara).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAs we noted in the Stockbit Commentary, with the massive rise in conglomerate stock prices, we believe investors can rotate or rebalance into several blue-chip stocks to manage portfolio risk-reward. We see consumer and banking sectors as attractive choices for investors, given that both sectors are currently valued at historically low levels. Generally, consumer stocks are discounted more than one standard deviation below their historical average, while banking stocks are almost two standard deviations below their historical average. We assess that the risk of further declines in these two sectors is relatively limited, with continued foreign outflows being a primary risk. Conversely, if profit-taking in conglomerate stocks persists, the upside potential offered by the consumer and banking sectors remains appealing. The table above shows valuations for several consumer and big-bank stocks, together with potential upside calculations based on a recovery to certain valuation levels.\n\nFundamentally, the consumer sector has relatively better net-profit growth prospects for 2025-2026F compared with big banks, with ICBP, INDF and KLBF standing out. Meanwhile, big banks—except BBCA—may see profit declines in 2025F before recovering in 2026F, but this is offset by higher dividend yields relative to the consumer sector. In the short term, we expect 3Q25 earnings to be the lowest (bottom) and to start recovering in 4Q25.",

      "content": "Coordinator of Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said on Friday (17/10) that the government will distribute an additional cash assistance totaling IDR 30 trillion to more than 35 million families during the October-December 2025 period. The government will also fund internships for 100,000 new university graduates. Previously, the government released a stimulus package worth IDR 61 trillion in the first half of 2025 to support weakening domestic demand.\n\nSpot gold prices briefly surged +1.23% to USD 4,379.93 per troy ounce on Friday (17/10), marking a new all-time high, before easing to around USD 4,343 per troy ounce. The gold price rally continued from a +2.83% rise to USD 4,326.58 per troy ounce on Thursday (16/10). The recent gold price increase was supported by higher safe-haven demand amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and concerns over deteriorating US-China trade relations.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment and Downstream Development reported that investment realization in Indonesia reached IDR 491.4 trillion in 3Q25 (+13.9% YoY, +2.9% QoQ). This brings the 9-month cumulative investment to IDR 1,434.3 trillion (+13.7% YoY), about 75% of the 2025 target of IDR 1,905.6 trillion, with labor absorption of 1.96 million people. Domestic investment grew +40.5% YoY to IDR 279.4 trillion, while foreign investment contracted -8.9% YoY to IDR 212 trillion, marking a second consecutive quarterly decline and a sharper drop than in 2Q25 (-6.9% YoY). Over the 9-month period, foreign investment contracted -1.5% YoY. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani cited geopolitical tensions and trade wars as factors hindering foreign investment, and said Indonesia will focus on attracting foreign capital to the maritime, forestry, and plantation sectors next year.\n\nOJK Chief Executive Inarno Djajadi said on Friday (17/10) that the regulator will strengthen supervision functions and improve early detection of abnormal or potentially illegal transactions. He added that OJK will enhance synergy with self-regulatory organizations and market participants, and coordinate closely with law-enforcement agencies to ensure market discipline, eradicate manipulative practices, and protect investors. His remarks followed Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa's statement that the government will not tolerate market manipulation or \"gorengan\" stocks, and urged that violators be subject to legal sanctions.\n\nInternational Financing Review reported that PT Anugrah Neo Energy Materials plans to start pre-marketing for an IPO on the IDX, targeting fund-raising of USD 400-700 million, with a listing target in December 2025.\n\nNational Nutrition Agency head Dadan Hindayana told Reuters on Thursday (16/10) that the free nutritious meals program is expected to reach only 70 million beneficiaries by the end of 2025 due to limited public kitchens, about 15% below the 2025 target of 83 million. Previously, the agency estimated that the program's budget absorption would reach IDR 99 trillion by the end of 2025, lower than the revised ceiling of IDR 171 trillion. The low absorption led the agency to return IDR 70 trillion to the government. In 2026, the allocation for the free nutritious meals program will rise to IDR 335 trillion, according to Reuters.\n\nDanantara CEO Rosan Roeslani said the company is currently discussing with stakeholders—including PT Kereta Api Indonesia (KAI), relevant ministries, and China's National Development and Reform Commission—to restructure the debt of the Whoosh high-speed rail project. The debt-resolution study is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025.",
