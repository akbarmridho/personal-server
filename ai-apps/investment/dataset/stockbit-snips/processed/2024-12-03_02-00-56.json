      "title": "Average Minimum Wage Rises +6.5% in 2025",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto announced that the average minimum wage increase in 2025 is +6.5%. Generally, this increase tends to align with the upper bound estimates we previously wrote about in Stockbit Snips, which implies a larger alpha variable value. However, the government has not yet released regulations regarding the formula used to calculate this minimum wage increase. The Minister of Manpower, Yassierli, stated that the Minister of Manpower regulation regarding the new minimum wage will be released on Wednesday (4/12). This regulation will replace Government Regulation No. 51/2023 concerning wages, which was annulled by the Constitutional Court in October 2024 following the revocation of the employment cluster from the Omnibus Law. Yassierli hopes that regional governments (pemda) can immediately release wage adjustment rules for their respective regions, targeting the announcement of provincial minimum wage (UMP) and regency/city minimum wage (UMK) adjustments for 2025 before Christmas 2024. Following the news of this minimum wage increase, the Chairperson of the Indonesian Employers Association, Shinta Kamdani, assessed that a minimum wage adjustment of +6.5% is too large an increase, which could trigger layoffs (PHK) and hinder new job creation. On the other hand, the President of KSPI and President of the Labor Party, Said Iqbal, said that the laborers will cancel the plan for a national strike because a meeting point regarding the minimum wage increase has been reached. The realization of the minimum wage increase at the regional level may have a deviation compared to the increase rate set by the central government. Here are the details: Key Takeaway: The +6.5% figure will serve as a reference for each region later. Compared to the average realization of minimum wage increases across all regions in Indonesia in recent years, this magnitude of increase is higher than in 2024 and is considered a relatively high increase in the last 3 years, although not as high as in 2023. A higher minimum wage increase has the potential to increase purchasing power and have a positive impact on consumer issuers, such as ICBP and MYOR. On the other hand, this increase can suppress profitability for issuers with a high proportion of opex from employee salaries, such as ACES and MAPI.",

The Director of Economics at S&P Global, Paul Smith, stated that the Indonesian manufacturing PMI in November 2024 was a mixed result, with output growing for the first time in the last five months, although sales continued the downward trend of the last five months.
