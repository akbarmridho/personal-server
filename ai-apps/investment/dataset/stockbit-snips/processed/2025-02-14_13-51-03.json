      "title": "UNVR FY24: Net Income -30% YoY, Below Expectations",
      "content": "Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) only recorded net income of 359 billion Rupiah in 4Q24 (-41% YoY, -34% QoQ), lower compared to the net income in 4Q23 when the boycott sentiment was at its peak. This result caused the net income for 2024 to reach only 3.4 trillion Rupiah (-30% YoY), below expectations because it only met 90% of the consensus estimate. The restructuring program currently being carried out by the company remains the main factor significantly suppressing short-term performance. Sales were impacted by the decision to reduce inventory at the distributor level, while profitability/margins plummeted due to transformation costs. Gross profit margin has been hovering at a low level of ~45% in the last 2 quarters (vs. previous normal: 49-50%) due to declining sales and transformation costs. Specifically in 4Q24, UNVR also booked one-off costs related to employee reductions, causing operating expenses for 'Salary' to surge, both in the 'Selling & Marketing' category (+110% YoY, +67% QoQ) and the 'General & Administrative' category (+55% YoY, +170% QoQ). UNVR management expects the restructuring program to continue in 1H25, so the company's performance will still be burdened, although with a smaller impact than what was felt in 4Q24. Positive results from this restructuring are expected to start showing in 2H25. Key Takeaway: With the strengthening of UNVR's stock price by +2.91% on Thursday (13/2) and +3.53% on Friday (14/2), we see the market responding positively to management's expectation that the company's worst performance has been passed in 4Q24 and will improve going forward. Progress from this restructuring program is something investors need to observe and monitor, as it will be the key factor determining the recovery of UNVR's stock price, in our view. *This article was previously released in Stockbit Commentary on Friday (14/2) morning.",

US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, stated that all studies related to reciprocal tariffs will be completed by April 1, 2025, allowing Trump to act immediately afterward. Bloomberg reported that these reciprocal tariffs will be adjusted for each country to offset the tariffs imposed by trading partners on the US. Furthermore, the consideration for imposing reciprocal tariffs includes not only the tariffs imposed by partner countries on US exports but also non-tariff barriers implemented by those countries such as unfair subsidies, regulations, value-added tax, exchange rates, lax intellectual property protection, and other factors deemed capable of restricting US trade. Trump also stated that he will impose import levies on cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals at higher rates than the reciprocal tariffs.",
