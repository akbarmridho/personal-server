      "title": "BBRI 4M25: Bank Only Net Profit -16% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded a net profit (bank only) of 3.9 trillion rupiah in April 2025 (-3% YoY, -13% MoM). This result caused the bank only net profit for 4M25 to fall by -16% YoY to 15 trillion rupiah, lower than the 2025 consolidated growth estimate from consensus at -2.8% YoY. Credit Growth Remains Challenging. BBRI bank-only credit disbursement was still relatively low at +4.2% YoY during 4M25 (vs. 3M25: +3.8% YoY, 4M24: +12% YoY), below management's consolidated 2025 growth guidance in the range of +7-9% YoY. As we previously wrote, the ongoing overhaul of the micro segment has impacted micro-credit disbursement rates, which fell -3% YoY in 1Q25. Net Interest Income Stagnant, Credit Cost Still High. On the top-line, Net Interest Income (NII) growth was relatively flat at -1% YoY during 4M25. The +4% YoY credit growth was not reflected in interest income growth due to lower yields offset by the weakening micro segment. Meanwhile, Non-Interest Income (Non-II) rose +5% YoY amidst soaring opex of +21% YoY. This resulted in Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) dropping -8% YoY during 4M25. Meanwhile, provision expenses decreased -28% YoY in April 2025 due to a high-base effect, but still rose +2% YoY during 4M25 due to the management provision overlay in January 2025. This realization placed the Cost of Credit (CoC) at 3.52% per 4M25 (vs. 4M24: 3.61%), which is higher than management's consolidated 2025 guidance. Key Takeaway: Overall, BBRI's performance trend during 4M25 is not much different from its 1Q25 performance, where challenges in the micro segment impacted NII stagnation and high CoC. In addition, the surge in opex is also a concern for us.",

      "title": "BUMI: Quasi Reorganization Awaits Regulator Approval",
      "content": "1. BUMI: Bumi Resources shareholders approved the quasi reorganization plan in the GMSLB on Monday (2/6). BUMI management stated that this corporate action will be submitted to regulators in approximately 2 working days after receiving shareholder approval. BUMI previously stated that the impact of the planned quasi reorganization will be reflected in the 2Q25 financial statements. 2. MEDC: Medco Energi Internasional recorded a net profit of 18 million US dollars in 1Q25 (-81% QoQ, -76% YoY), below expectations (5%/5% of 2025F Stockbit estimate/consensus). The decline in net profit was mainly pressured by an association entity loss of 20 million US dollars (vs. 4Q24: profit of 230 thousand US dollars) due to swelling losses from Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN) to 138.8 million US dollars (vs. 4Q24: loss of 80 million US dollars). Operationally, MEDC's operating profit still grew +1.2% QoQ to 182 million US dollars, in line with consensus expectations (24.9% of consensus 2025F estimate) and exceeding our expectations (27.6% of Stockbit 2025F estimate). MEDC recorded a decrease in oil and gas production by -2.5% QoQ and -4.6% QoQ, respectively, with oil ASP at 72 US dollars per barrel (-0.2% QoQ) and gas ASP at 7.1 US dollars per MMBtu (+0.0% QoQ). 3. ADMR: Adaro Minerals Indonesia shareholders approved the dividend distribution plan for the 2024 fiscal year amounting to 120 million US dollars, equivalent to 48 rupiah per share assuming the Rupiah to US Dollar exchange rate is 16,500. This amount indicates a dividend yield of 4.6% as of Monday (2/6). Cum date and payment date have not been announced. 4. INCO: Vale Indonesia awarded mining services contracts to PT Pamapersada Nusantara and PT Antareja Mahada Makmur with undisclosed transaction values. PT Pamapersada Nusantara will act as the contractor in the Pomalaa Block, while PT Antareja Mahada Makmur will operate in the Bahodopi 1 Block. 5. INET: Kontan reported that Sinergi Inti Andalan Prima secured an international bandwidth sales contract of 10 Tbps to Solusi Sinergi Digital (WIFI) for a period of 10 years. The President Director of INET, Muhammad Arif, stated that this contract will have a positive impact on INET's performance because the company will gain recurring income, although he did not detail the total value of this cooperation. 6. CFIN: Clipan Finance Indonesia will distribute dividends for the 2024 fiscal year of approximately 200 billion rupiah or 50 rupiah per share. This amount is equivalent to ~93% dividend payout ratio (vs. 2023: 0%) and indicates a dividend yield of 12.7% as of Monday (2/6). The cum date for the regular and negotiation markets is June 10, 2025, while payment is on June 27, 2025. 7. MTEL: The Director of Dayamitra Telekomunikasi, Hendra Purnama, stated that the company plans to allocate capex of 5.3 trillion rupiah throughout 2025 (vs. 2024 capex allocation: 5.6 trillion rupiah). Hendra mentioned that 2 trillion rupiah of this budget will be used for inorganic expansion such as towers, fiber optics, or other assets related to the tower ecosystem, while the remainder is for organic expansion. MTEL targets an additional 2,500 tenants and 10,000 kilometers of fiber optic cable during 2025. In 1Q25, MTEL had 60,259 tenants, 39,593 towers, and 53,544 km of fiber optic cable length. 8. IOTF: Sumber Sinergi Makmur announced that PT Gaia Artha Dinamic plans to acquire 49.38% of the company's shares from Alamsyah and Gracia Puspita Suciono. Alamsyah is the President Director and controller of the company. The value of this planned transaction has not been announced. After this transaction is completed, PT Gaia Artha Dinamic will become the new controller of IOTF and will execute a mandatory tender offer.",

      "content": "1. US President, Donald Trump, said on Friday (30/5) that he plans to double steel and aluminum import tariffs to 50%. This discussion was announced just hours after Trump accused China of violating agreements with the US to mutually lift tariffs and restrictions on critical mineral trade. 2. BPS recorded that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in Indonesia moderated to 1.6% YoY in May 2025 (vs. Apr 2025: 1.95% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation of 1.94% YoY. On a monthly basis, Indonesia experienced deflation of 0.37% MoM (vs. Apr 2025: 1.17% MoM inflation), lower than the consensus expectation which predicted deflation of 0.01% MoM. Core inflation moderated to the lowest level in the last 4 months at 2.4% YoY (vs. Apr 2025: 2.5% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation of 2.5% YoY. 3. S&P Global recorded that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 47.4 in May 2025 (vs. Apr 2025: 46.7), marking the second consecutive month of factory activity contraction. New orders shrunk the most since August 2021 and foreign sales dropped significantly, especially to the US. 4. China's national statistics bureau recorded that China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 49.5 in May 2025 (vs. Apr 2025: 49), in line with consensus expectations while also marking the second consecutive month of factory activity contraction. Output recovered following the de-escalation of the trade war and ongoing efforts by the Chinese government to boost domestic demand. Business confidence improved to 52.5 after hitting a 7-month low of 52.1 in April 2025. 5. Indonesia's trade balance surplus shrank significantly to 0.15 billion US dollars in April 2025 (vs. Apr 2024: surplus of 2.72 billion US dollars, Mar 2025: surplus of 4.33 billion US dollars). This result was pressured by non-oil and gas imports and marked the lowest surplus since April 2020, which was the last month Indonesia experienced a trade balance deficit. Imports surged +21.84% YoY (vs. expectation of +7.75% YoY) and marked the highest growth since September 2022, while exports only grew +5.76% YoY though in line with expectations. During 4M25, Indonesia's trade balance showed a surplus of 11.07 billion US dollars (vs. 4M24: surplus of 10.97 billion US dollars). 6. Commodity trade analysis firm, Kpler, noted that Indonesian thermal coal exports during 5M25 fell -12% YoY to 188 million tons, marking the lowest level since 5M22. Indonesian thermal coal sales to China dropped -23% YoY or 20 million tons lower during 5M25, while exports to India fell -14% YoY or 6.5 million tons lower. The decline in sales to these two countries—which historically account for two-thirds of all Indonesian coal exports—was pressured by increased domestic production in each country, resulting in lower import demand. Additionally, Kpler also noted that Indonesia experienced a decline in thermal coal sales to 8 out of its top 10 importing countries due to weakening consumer demand and global manufacturing activity. 7. Bloomberg reported that Tsingshan Holding Group Co. Ltd. reduced its stainless steel production volume since early May 2025 at the Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP), Sulawesi. Bloomberg mentioned that this move is likely to support stainless steel prices, although it may suppress nickel prices. The prices of both commodities reached their lowest levels in the last 5 years in April 2025. Tsingshan has not commented on this issue. Tsingshan's production accounted for almost one-third of the world's stainless steel production in 2024, according to Macquarie Group. 8. The Central Statistics Agency recorded that foreign tourist arrivals to Indonesia reached 4.33 million during 4M25 (+5.6% YoY), equivalent to 27-31% of the government's 2025 target in the range of 14-16 million.",
