      "content": "Minister of Coordinating Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto said on Saturday (24/5) that the government is preparing six economic stimulus packages to maintain consumer purchasing power, especially during the school holiday period in June-July 2025. The six stimulus packages – currently being finalized and scheduled to be launched on 5 June 2025 – focus on boosting activity in the transportation, energy, and social assistance sectors. The details are: 1) Discount on train, airline and sea transport tickets during the school holidays; 2) Toll road tariff reduction in June-July 2025 for 110 million users; 3) Electricity tariff discount of 50 % in June-July 2025, targeted at 79.3 million households with electricity capacity up to 1,300 VA; 4) Food card and food assistance to 18.3 million beneficiary families (KPM); 5) Wage subsidy (BSU) for workers earning below IDR 3.5 million or the provincial minimum wage; 6) Discount on occupational accident insurance (JKK) premiums for workers in labor-intensive sectors. The government also urges regional governments to actively create local tourism and entertainment activities to stimulate domestic movement during the school holidays. This is the second stimulus package of the year; the first was released in January-February 2025. Core Indonesia researcher Yusuf Rendy Manilet said the stimulus appears as an emergency measure to prevent a deeper economic slowdown. He explained that household consumption could slow in 2Q25, given the absence of seasonal peaks such as Ramadan or Lebaran. In 1Q25, Indonesia’s economy grew only +4.87 % YoY (vs. 1Q24: +5.11 % YoY, 4Q24: +5.02 % YoY), below the 2025 government target of +5.2 % YoY, with household consumption easing to +4.89 % YoY (vs. 1Q24: +4.91 % YoY).",
