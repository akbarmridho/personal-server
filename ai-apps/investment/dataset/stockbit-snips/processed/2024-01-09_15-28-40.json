      "content": "Build Your Dream (BYD), an electric vehicle manufacturer from China, announced it will launch its products in Indonesia on January 18, 2024. CNN Indonesia reported that BYD will release 3 electric car models in Indonesia, namely Dolphin, Atto 3, and Seal. Head of Marketing of PT BYD Motor Indonesia, Luther Panjaitan, told Tempo that the Seal and Atto 3 models have arrived in Indonesia. Luther also mentioned that these two models are ready for marketing in Indonesia in 1H24, but the price details have not yet been announced. Before Indonesia, the Dolphin, Seal, and Atto 3 models have been marketed in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Here are the price ranges: Thailand (assuming an exchange rate of 1 baht = 444 rupiah): Dolphin: 311-382 million rupiah. Atto 3: 488-533 million rupiah. Seal: 578-711 million rupiah. Malaysia (assuming an exchange rate of 1 ringgit = 3.344 rupiah): Dolphin: 335-420 million rupiah. Atto 3: 501-561 million rupiah. The announcement of BYD's launch in Indonesia came less than a month after the ratification of Presidential Regulation No. 79 of 2023 which details incentives for imported CBU electric vehicles, including duty exemption and luxury goods sales tax (PPnBM) exemption. Previously, since 2018 BYD has been a supplier for Transjakarta electric buses and Blue Bird electric taxis ($BIRD).",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "With the assumption that the selling price in Indonesia will not be significantly different from that in Thailand and Malaysia, BYD's products have the potential to become more attractive to electric vehicle consumers in Indonesia because they offer higher value-for-money. This is because, in terms of pricing, BYD's products will be positioned in the middle ground between the Wuling Air EV (250-300 million rupiah) and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 (750-900 million rupiah). In November 2023, Wuling EV and Hyundai Ioniq dominated electric vehicle sales in Indonesia, contributing 40.7% and 37.9% respectively to total electric vehicle sales. Furthermore, the presence of products with good value-for-money has the potential to accelerate the penetration of electric vehicles in Indonesia. In November 2023, electric vehicle sales reached 2.25% of total vehicle sales in November 2023, up from 0.32% in January 2023.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia announced that the Consumer Confidence Index in December 2023 rose to 123.8 (vs. November 2023: 123.6). The Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing is reviewing a Housing Ownership Loan (KPR) scheme with a term of 35 years. This scheme is adapted from Japan, which has been successful with its housing system. Chief Economist of Bank Tabungan Negara ($BBTN), Winang Budoyo, proposed that the KPR scheme use a tiered interest rate, with gradual increases over a 10-year period. The Ministry of Industry cut the quota for electric motorcycle subsidies for 2024 from 600,000 units to 50,000 units. This cut was due to low realization of electric motorcycle sales during 2023, which only reached 11,532 units as of December 26, 2023, equivalent to 5.76% of the FY23 target of 200,000 units. Brent crude oil prices fell -3.26% on Monday (8/1), driven by a price cut of 2 US dollars per barrel for Arab Light oil sold to Asian customers and an OPEC production increase of 70,000 barrels month-on-month in December 2023. On Tuesday (9/1), Brent crude oil prices stabilized with a strengthening of +0.75% intraday, following the continuation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.",
