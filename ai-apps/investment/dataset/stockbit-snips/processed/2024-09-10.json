      "title": "TPMA Forms New Joint Venture, Potential Net Profit Increase up to +15%",
      "content": "Trans Power Marine (TPMA) announced a cooperation with PT Samudra Investama Maju to establish a joint venture named PT Trans Ocean Permata (TOP) that will operate in coal transportation and logistics services in South Sumatra. TPMA explained that TOP has an initial capital of 20 billion rupiah, with the company holding a 51 percent ownership. Within the next two to three years, TOP plans to acquire 20 tugboats and barges and two floating cranes with a capital expenditure of 90 million US dollars. The expansion will be financed 20 percent by internal cash and the remaining 80 percent through bank loans. This is not TPMA's first expansion via joint venture. Previously, in 2021 the company formed a joint venture called PT Trans Logistik Perkasa (TLP) together with T&J Industrial Holding Limited (TJI), an entity of Tsingshan Holding Group, and Pacific Pelayaran Indonesia. TLP was created to transport Tsingshan nickel output in Maluku. The company had 41 tugboats and barges as of the first half of 2024, with a target fleet of 60 tugboats and barges by 2025. Key Takeaway: The formation of this joint venture could become a growth catalyst for TPMA's financial performance. Based on our conservative estimate, TOP could generate revenue of 4.9 to 10.9 million US dollars in its first year of operation, equivalent to 5.4 to 12.1 percent of our FY24 forecast for TPMA's post‑consolidation revenue with PT Bahtera Energi Samudra Tuah (BEST). We also estimate TOP's first‑year net profit at 752.6 thousand to 1.7 million US dollars, representing 2.7 to 6 percent of our FY24 net profit forecast for TPMA. Assumptions used: - Acquisition of 20 tugboats and barges and 2 floating cranes over a three‑year period. - Revenue per tugboat/barge assumed at 1.1 billion rupiah per month, based on TLP's lowest per‑asset revenue among TPMA and BEST. - Revenue per floating crane assumed at 7 billion rupiah per month, matching TPMA's floating crane per‑asset revenue. - Net profit margin assumed at 30 percent, after reducing non‑controlling interest by 49 percent. If TOP completes the full fleet acquisition, we estimate TPMA's revenue and net profit could increase by 26.8 million and 4.1 million US dollars respectively, equivalent to 29.5 percent and 14.7 percent of our FY24 revenue and net profit forecasts for TPMA.",
