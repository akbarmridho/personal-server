      "content": "Gaikindo noted that car wholesales in June 2025 only reached 57,760 units (-23% YoY, -5% MoM). This is the lowest monthly sales figure this year, excluding the sales in April 2025 which were affected by Eid al-Fitr. This realization brings sales throughout 1H25 to 374,741 units (-9% YoY), only equivalent to 42-50% of Gaikindo's 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 (vs. 1H24: 47% realization for 2024). Japanese brands generally continued to record weak sales, both for Astra International's brands ($ASII) and non-ASII brands. Among Japanese brands, only Suzuki recorded positive annual sales growth in June 2025. Meanwhile, sales of Chinese brands - excluding Wuling - continued to show positive momentum in June 2025, especially Chery which managed to record monthly car sales above 2,000 units for the first time. In June 2025, BYD (including Denza) and Chery each became the 6th and 7th highest-selling brands, up from the 9th and 10th positions as of December 2024. With the June 2025 realization, the combined market share of ASII's two mainstay brands - namely, Toyota and Daihatsu - only reached 50.2% during 1H25 (vs. 1H24: 52.5%). Honda became the brand experiencing the largest market share decline during 1H25 to the level of 8.7% (vs. 1H24: 11.6%). Meanwhile, the market share of BYD (including Denza) and Chery are at levels of 5.3% (vs. 1H24: 0.4%) and 2.7% (vs. 1H24: 1%) respectively. The Chairman of Gaikindo, Yohannes Nangoi, said in June 2025 that his party, along with the government, is currently discussing finding new breakthroughs to boost car sales in Indonesia. Yohannes mentioned that these breakthroughs could be in the form of fiscal incentives or tax reforms, which will be announced if agreed upon.",

      "content": "Although market expectations for the automotive sector appear low, we assess that the worsening of the car sales trend in the last 2 months means that the potential for significant recovery in automotive stocks - such as $ASII, $AUTO, and $DRMA - will not yet be visible, unless significant incentives are launched by the government. Meanwhile, the strong sales of BYD are one of the driving factors for the growth in completely built-up car loading and unloading volume throughput for $IPCC, which for 5M25 reached 348.5 thousand units (+9% YoY).",

      "content": "1. US President, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday (8/7) that the US will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, and will soon implement tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Trump also repeated his threat to impose a 10% tariff on products from BRICS member countries. Furthermore, Trump emphasized that there will be \"no change\" to the tariff implementation deadline schedule on August 1, 2025. This statement came a day after Trump said the August 1, 2025 deadline was \"not 100% certain.\" Trump also said that trade negotiations with the European Union and China were going well, but he would send tariff determination letters for the European Union in the coming days. 2. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, told Reuters on Tuesday (8/7) that PT Pertamina has signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase LPG, gasoline, and crude oil from the US. Airlangga also mentioned that FKS Group and Sorini Agro Asia Corporindo have signed an agreement to purchase corn from Cargill. On the same day, the Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, told national media that the decision to import energy from the US would be postponed until the final negotiation results. Previously, the government offered a package worth US$34 billion for investment and goods imports from the US as part of the tariff negotiation. This package includes energy purchases worth US$15.5 billion and agricultural goods purchases. 3. Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, said that the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is opening up the option of direct appointment for the management of oil and gas working areas. Currently, the management of oil and gas working areas is done through auction or tender. Yuliot explained that the idea of direct appointment is the government's effort for process simplification. The direct appointment option for oil and gas working areas will be pushed through the revision of Law No. 22/2001. 4. Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, said that the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is still discussing regulations related to export duty tariffs on coal and gold products. Yuliot explained that his party is still considering the prices of gold and coal and considering the competitive level of the commodities on the international market. Yuliot mentioned that his party would hold a meeting with the Ministry of Finance regarding the decision on export duty levies for both commodities. Yuliot's statement emerged after the government and the DPR opened the possibility of imposing export duties on coal and gold products starting in 2026. 5. Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara has appointed DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis SA, and Standard Chartered Plc as coordinators for a multicurrency loan facility up to US$10 billion. Bloomberg previously reported that the loan facility has a tenor of 3-5 years, intended for general corporate purposes. Bloomberg also reported that the loan will be unsecured and will not be accompanied by any guarantee, and will not be accompanied by any letter of support or statement from the government. 6. Bank Indonesia estimates that retail sales in June 2025 will grow +2% YoY and +0.5% MoM. In May 2025, retail sales recorded growth of +1.9% YoY and -1.3% MoM (vs. April 2025: -0.3% YoY, -5.1% MoM), lower than Bank Indonesia's expectation of +2.6% YoY and -0.6% MoM growth. The annual growth of retail sales in May 2025 was supported by sustained demand due to the joint leave days for Vesak and Ascension Day.",
