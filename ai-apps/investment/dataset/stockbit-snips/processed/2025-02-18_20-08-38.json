      "title": "DHE SDA Revised, Government Provides Flexibility",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto on Monday (17/2) officially issued Government Regulation No. 8/2025 which mandates the deposit of 100 percent of foreign exchange from natural resource exports (DHE SDA) domestically for 1 year. This policy takes effect starting March 1, 2025. This new regulation does not apply to the oil and gas sector, where the implementation of DHE SDA placement for this sector will still refer to Government Regulation No. 36/2023 with a placement of 30% for 3 months. President Prabowo estimates that the revision of this regulation will cause foreign exchange from exports held in domestic banks to potentially increase by 80 billion US dollars by the end of 2025 or more than 100 billion US dollars in the next 12 months since its implementation. The revision of the DHE SDA placement rule itself is intended to increase the supply of state foreign exchange to ease pressure on the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar recently. Although the portion and tenor have increased, the revision of the DHE SDA rule provides room for exporters to use foreign exchange from exports placed in special accounts for several purposes, namely: Exchange to Rupiah in the same bank for business operations Payment of tax obligations, state revenues, and other obligations to the government Payment of dividends in foreign currency Payment for the procurement of goods and services that are not yet available domestically Repayment of loans for capital goods procurement in foreign currency. Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated that the government will ensure the DHE SDA policy does not cause disruption to companies. Several association representatives also indicated that they do not object to the new regulation. According to the Executive Director of the Indonesia Mining Association, Hendra Sinadia, the revision of this regulation provides room for exporters to maintain company cash flow. Key Takeaway: The revision of the DHE SDA placement rule has the potential to provide a positive sentiment towards banking issuers along with the addition of foreign exchange liquidity. With the flexibility that allows the use of export foreign exchange for operational and financial needs, we assess that the regulation revision does not provide too significant an influence on the sustainability of natural resource exporters' businesses.",
