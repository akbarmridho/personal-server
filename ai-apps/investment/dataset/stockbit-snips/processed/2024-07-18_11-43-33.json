      "title": "Prabowo's Nephew Inaugurated as Deputy Minister of Finance",
      "content": "President Joko Widodo officially inaugurated Thomas Djiwandono, Prabowo Subianto's nephew and the treasurer of the Gerindra Party, as the deputy minister of finance on Thursday (18/7). The head of the Prabowo-Gibran Synchronization Task Force, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, told Reuters that this inauguration was intended to smooth the transition of government from the administration of Mr. Jokowi to Mr. Prabowo. Based on a report from Harian Kompas, Thomas's career began as an intern journalist at Tempo Magazine in 1993 and at Indonesia Business Weekly in 1994. Additionally, Thomas worked as a financial analyst at Whetlock NatWest Securities, Hong Kong. He also helped his uncle, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, manage the Arsari Group by serving as Deputy CEO. Thomas is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University with a degree in International Relations and International Economics. Thomas was previously rumored to hold the next finance minister position after joining the Prabowo-Gibran Synchronization Task Force in the economic and financial sector. In a statement to Reuters, Thomas said that he would not serve as finance minister in the Prabowo-Gibran administration. Thomas mentioned that Prabowo is still considering professional candidates to fill the finance minister position. In February 2024, Bloomberg reported that Prabowo was considering a number of former bankers as candidates for finance minister. According to Bloomberg sources, some names considered included Minister of Health Budi Gunadi Sadikin, Deputy Minister of State-Owned Enterprises Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, Head of the OJK Supervisory Board Mahendra Siregar, and President Director of Bank Negara Indonesia Royke Tumilaar. Meanwhile, in April 2024, Reuters reported that former finance minister, Chatib Basri, was also one of the candidates considered by Prabowo. Key Takeaway: The selection of the finance minister for the next administration potentially influences foreign investor perception of Indonesia. This week, the fixed-income strategist for Asia at asset management firm Robeco, Philip McNicholas, told Bloomberg that the market is likely to impose a larger risk premium on Indonesian debt if the next finance minister is considered too subservient to Prabowo, instead of continuing to push for fiscal reform.",

This figure implies an acquisition valuation of BEST at 3.6x P/E for FY23, lower than our previous estimate at 3.8x. However, if using the annualized 1Q24 figure, the acquisition P/E rises to 6x due to weak performance in 1Q24. TPMA informed Stockbit that BEST's performance in 1Q24 was affected by force majeure at one of its main clients' mines, but this issue was resolved in 2Q24, so performance is expected to recover in the coming quarters.",
