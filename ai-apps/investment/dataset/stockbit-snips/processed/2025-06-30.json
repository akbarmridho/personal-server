With this decision, future elections will be held in two stages. The national election to choose members of the DPR, DPD, as well as the president and vice-president will be held first. After a gap of 2 to 2.5 years, the local election will be held to choose members of the DPRD, governors, and regents and mayors. 2. Reuters reported that the Indonesian government will relax import restrictions and regulations, including the removal of import licence requirements for certain goods and the exemption of several industrial raw materials from the import restriction list. Reuters noted that although government officials did not explicitly link this plan to the tariff negotiations with the United States, the discussion appears ahead of the US-Indonesia tariff negotiation deadline on 9 July 2025. The import facilitation will affect ten commodity groups, including fertilizer products, forestry products, and plastics, and is planned to take effect within two months. 3. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said that the Indonesian government has offered the United States an opportunity to invest in critical mineral projects as part of the tariff negotiations. Airlangga mentioned that BPI Danantara will also be involved in the offered projects. 4. Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia claimed that the Cepu oil block recorded an additional oil production of 30,000 barrels per day, reaching 180,000 barrels per day. The government targets total oil lifting in 2025 to reach 605,000 barrels per day, although the actual production during the first five months of 2025 (5M25) was 567,900 barrels per day (versus 579,700 barrels per day in 2024). 5. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) officially postponed the implementation of the co-payment policy on health insurance products, which had been scheduled to take effect on 1 January 2026. The decision was taken following a joint meeting with Commission XI of the House of Representatives on Monday (30/6).",

      "title": "BBRI 5M25: Net Profit Bank Only Down 15% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded net profit for bank-only operations of 3.6 trillion rupiah in May 2025 (down 11% year-over-year, down 7% month-over-month). This result makes the net profit for bank-only over the five months to May 2025 (5M25) equal to 18.6 trillion rupiah (down 15% YoY), which is lower than the consensus expectation that projected consolidated net profit for 2025F to fall 3% YoY.\n\nNet Interest Income (NII) fell slightly by 1% YoY during 5M25. This improvement compared with the 3M25 realization at a -5% YoY level, driven by improvements in both Interest Income and Interest Expense. Both were relatively flat (-1% YoY) during 5M25, compared with the 3M25 realization that fell around 3-4% YoY. The improvement in Interest Income trend occurred together with credit growth that reached +5% YoY in May 2025, compared with +4% YoY in March 2025, although still below the management's consolidated 2025 target of +7-9% (after adjustment for bank-only versus consolidated).\n\nNet Interest Margin (NIM) remained weak in May 2025 at 6.17%, so the NIM for 5M25 was at 6.38% (versus 6.48% in 5M24), which we assess as still in line with the management's consolidated 2025 target (after adjustment for bank-only versus consolidated).\n\nNon-Interest Income (Non-II) and Provisions Worsened\nThe improving NII trend was not reflected in Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP), which fell 9% YoY during 5M25, compared with a 6% YoY decline in 3M25. This was caused by weakening Non-Interest Income in April-May 2025. Non-II in the last two months reached only 3.8 trillion rupiah and 3.6 trillion rupiah, smaller than the January-March 2025 level of around 4.1-4.2 trillion rupiah per month, due to lower trading gains and other income.\n\nMeanwhile, provision expenses and Cost of Credit (CoC) rose to 3.4 trillion rupiah and 3.24% in May 2025, marking a second consecutive month increase since March 2025. This realization made provision expenses for 5M25 total 17.7 trillion rupiah (down 1% YoY), with CoC at 3.46%, which we assess as still above the management's consolidated 2025 target range of 3-3.2% (after adjustment for bank-only versus consolidated).\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe assess BBRI's net profit performance relative to consensus expectations requires a significant recovery in the second half of 2025, although we still see potential for further downward revision of the 2025F net profit estimate from consensus after the recent 2-12% cuts in the last three to six months. From a valuation perspective, BBRI trades at 1.7x 1-Year Forward P/BV on Monday (30/6), almost reaching -2 standard deviations (1.6x) below the five-year historical average. We also see BBRI offering a potential dividend yield minimum of 7.5%.",
