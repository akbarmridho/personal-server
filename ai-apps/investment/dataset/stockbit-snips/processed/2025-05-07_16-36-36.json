      "title": "Oil Rises +3%, Indication of Oversold & Increased Demand",
      "content": "Brent crude futures for July 2025 contracts rose +3.1% to the level of 62.15 US dollars per barrel at the close of yesterday's trading, Tuesday (6/5). This increase occurred after massive selling due to oversupply concerns from increased OPEC+ production per June 2025, which caused Brent crude oil prices in the futures market to drop to 60.23 US dollars per barrel on Monday (5/5) and marked its lowest level since February 2021. The rise in oil prices yesterday was likely triggered by trader buying action, as prices had technically entered oversold territory. Furthermore, the increase in oil prices was supported by indications of increased demand from China and Europe, a decrease in US crude oil stocks, and the escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the Israeli attack on Yemen's main airport. Reuters reported that positive sentiment towards the Chinese economy strengthened after consumer spending during the May Day holiday grew +8% YoY. May Day itself is one of the longest holidays in China and is often used as an indicator of consumer confidence in that country. Meanwhile, data from LSEG I/B/E/S expects European companies to record net profit growth of +0.4% YoY in 1Q25, up from last week's estimate of -1.7% YoY and the post-Trump tariff announcement estimate of -3.5% YoY. Regarding supply, analyst consensus compiled by Reuters estimates that US crude oil stocks for the week ending May 2, 2025, will fall by 800,000 barrels. If this expectation is met, it will be the first consecutive two-week decline in US crude oil stocks since January 2025.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "Despite strengthening, the price movement of this oil is likely only a technical rebound after the sharp correction on Monday (5/5). Looking ahead, we are of the opinion that Brent oil prices throughout 2025 will tend to stabilize in the range of 60-70 US dollars per barrel as a base case, considering that global uncertainty remains high and there is a potential for growth slowdown in various regions. Confirmation of increased demand from China and Europe, as well as the decline in US crude oil stocks scheduled for release Wednesday night (7/5), can be an additional catalyst for rising oil prices going forward. However, oil price movements will also be influenced by developments in the trade war. The US and China are reportedly meeting in Switzerland this weekend, where Bloomberg reports the talks will focus on de-escalating the trade war.",

      "content": "1. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will travel to Switzerland this weekend for trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. This will be the first trade talk officially confirmed by both countries. Bloomberg reports that talks between the US and China will focus on de-escalating the trade war. 2. India attacked Pakistan on Wednesday (7/5) and Pakistan claimed to have shot down 5 Indian fighter jets, marking the worst fighting in over 2 decades between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. Pakistan stated that India triggered the conflict and asserted its intention to retaliate. Meanwhile, India claimed its attack was in retaliation for a militant attack on tourists that killed 26 people in Indian Kashmir last month. 3. China's central bank announced on Wednesday (7/5) that it will cut the 7-day reverse repo rate from 1.5% to 1.4% on Thursday (8/5) and will lower the minimum reserve requirement ratio by -50 bps next week. 4. Director of the Monetary Policy and Economic Policy Department of Bank Indonesia, Juli Budi Winantya, stated on Wednesday (7/5) that Bank Indonesia's current policy is finding the \"optimal balance\" between inflation stability and economic growth. Juli's statement came 2 days after BPS announced that Indonesia's economic growth during 1Q25 only reached +4.87% YoY, marking the weakest growth since 3Q21 although it is in line with Bank Indonesia's projection targeting the range of +4.7-5.5% YoY during 2025. Previously, the latest survey from Reuters and Bloomberg indicated that the consensus among economists expected Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by another 2x down to the level of 5.25% by the end of 2025. 5. Director General of Minerals and Coal of the Ministry of ESDM, Tri Winarno, stated on Tuesday (6/5) that there are 7 coal mining companies holding first-generation PKP2B permits that are required to carry out coal downstreaming projects, namely PT Arutmin Indonesia and PT Kaltim Prima Coal (a subsidiary of Bumi Resources ($BUMI)), Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI), PT Kideco Jaya Agung (a subsidiary of Indika Energy ($INDY)), PT Multi Harapan Utama, PT Tanito Harum (a subsidiary of Harum Energy ($HRUM)), and PT Berau Coal. Tri mentioned that the total coal downstreaming investment from these 7 mines reaches approximately 11.5 billion US dollars or approximately 188.7 trillion rupiah. 6. Reuters reported on Tuesday (6/5) that seaborne thermal coal prices in Asia reached a 4-year low as imports from major importing countries—namely China, India, and Japan—waned. Imports from China in April 2025 specifically dropped -4.7% MoM to 22.72 million tons, causing China's coal imports over 4M25 to fall -13.1% YoY to 91.56 million tons. The decline in coal imports from China was pressured by reduced utilization of PLTU and increased coal production in China. 7. President Prabowo Subianto has issued Presidential Regulation No. 46/2025 which permits the government to procure goods with a minimum Domestic Component Level (TKDN) of 25%, lower than the previous provision of a minimum of 40%. This regulation also allows the government to purchase goods with less than 25% local content if facing supply constraints and needing to import the goods if they are unavailable domestically. This regulation was released amidst the Indonesian government's efforts to negotiate tariffs with the US. 8. Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Rosan Roeslani, claimed on Tuesday (6/5) that 7 electric vehicle manufacturers have committed to investing in Indonesia: BYD, Citroen, AION, Maxus, Geely, VinFast, and VW. Rosan claimed that the total investment value from these 7 companies reached 15.4 trillion rupiah, with a planned electric vehicle production of 281,000 units per year. 9. President Prabowo Subianto received a visit from Bill Gates at the Merdeka Palace, Jakarta, on Wednesday (7/5). The meeting discussed strategic cooperation in the health sector in efforts to tackle infectious diseases, such as polio, tuberculosis (TBC), and malaria. Gates stated that his foundation, the Gates Foundation, plans to launch new anemia drugs and TBC vaccines in Indonesia in the coming years. 10. CEO of BPI Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, stated on Wednesday (7/5) that his party will establish a trust fund that could potentially cooperate with the Gates Foundation in various fields, ranging from education, health, to poverty alleviation. He stated that Danantara will contribute up to 1 billion US dollars to the fund over the next 5-6 years.",
