      "title": "US Inflation Above Expectations, Higher-for-Longer Narrative Strengthens",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (12 February) announced that core inflation in the United States rose year-on-year in January 2025 and exceeded expectations. Details are as follows: Inflation YoY: 3% (consensus: 2.9%, December 2024: 2.9%). Inflation MoM: 0.5% (consensus: 0.3%, December 2024: 0.4%). Core inflation YoY: 3.3% (consensus: 3.1%, December 2024: 3.2%). Core inflation MoM: 0.4% (consensus: 0.3%, December 2024: 0.2%). This development reinforces the higher-for-longer narrative, especially with the risk of an escalation in trade wars. Prior to the inflation release, U.S. President Donald Trump said there would be retaliatory tariffs for all countries that impose tariffs on the United States and announced a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports to the United States. The inflation data release came only one day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the U.S. Senate that the Fed is not in a rush to cut interest rates, citing a strong economy, low unemployment and inflation still above the 2% target. Powell also warned that reducing rates too quickly or too much could hinder disinflation progress, reaffirming the Fedâ€™s stance of holding rates steady at the January 2025 meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool on Thursday (13 February), the probability that the Fed will cut rates by more than 25 basis points in 2025 fell to 35.2% from 58.1% on 6 February 2025. Following the inflation release, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) briefly rose 0.05% to 107.97 before closing down 0.39% at 107.55. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also rose 9 basis points to 4.62%. U.S. equity indices closed mixed: Dow Jones -0.50%, S&P 500 -0.27% and Nasdaq +0.12%. In Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed weaker by 0.48% on Thursday (13 February). The 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose 1 basis point to 6.63% and the rupiah strengthened 0.17% to 16,368 per U.S. dollar. Key Takeaway: Although expectations for a U.S. rate cut have declined, Bloomberg consensus still expects Bank Indonesia to cut rates by another 50 basis points to 5.25% by the end of 2025. Previously, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% in January 2025 amid a weakening rupiah, a move aimed at supporting economic growth as consumption, employment, investment and exports slowed. This development underscores that volatility from economic data will persist. With the outlook for rate cuts and forward uncertainty, investors can lock in short-term government bond yields that offer attractive risk-reward with lower volatility than long-term bonds. Short-term FR bonds such as PBS032 and PBS003, yielding around 6.3-6.45% with maturities of about 1.5-2 years, are suggested.",
