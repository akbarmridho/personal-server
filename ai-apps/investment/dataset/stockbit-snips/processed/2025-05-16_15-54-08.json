      "title": "Indonesian Coal Exports Decline, Pressed by China's Demand",
      "content": "Commodity analysis firm Kpler noted that thermal coal exports from Indonesia decreased by 20 million tons to 150 million tons during 4M25 (-12% YoY), marking the lowest export volume in the last 3 years and the worst year-on-year percentage decline since early 2017. Indonesia's export decline during 4M25 was pressed by weakening demand from China and India, both of which are currently experiencing increases in domestic coal production. Exports to China reduced by 14 million tons or equivalent to -20% YoY during 4M25, while exports to India reduced by 6 million tons or equivalent to -15% YoY. Meanwhile, data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources actually shows a lower figure, with Indonesian coal exports since the beginning of the year reaching ~131 million tons as of May 16, 2025. This amount only fulfills ~26.2% of the 2025 export target set at ~500 million tons. For context, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources recorded that Indonesian coal exports during 2024 reached ~441 million tons, only fulfilling ~90% of the 2024 target of 490 million tons. The decline in Indonesian coal exports also occurs amidst a decrease in coal-fired electricity demand. The think tank Ember noted that coal-fired power generation across Asia decreased by -3% YoY during 1Q25 coinciding with the shift to clean energy sources and weak Chinese industrial conditions. The shrinking volume of Indonesian coal exports was likely pressured by the decline in sales volume of several coal issuers during 1Q25, such as United Tractors ($UNTR), Bumi Resources ($BUMI), and Harum Energy ($HRUM) [see table]. Nevertheless, several issuers - such as Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI), Bukit Asam ($PTBA), and Indo Tambangraya Megah ($ITMG) - still recorded annual increases in exports and sales volume. On the supply side, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources noted that Indonesian coal production reached only 171 million tons during 1Q25 (-16.1% YoY), fulfilling only ~23.1% of the 2025 target set at ~740 million tons. Based on the explanation from ITMG management during the 1Q25 earnings call, Asia-Pacific coal demand is expected to decrease by 71 million metric tons during 2025, mainly pressed by China. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific coal supply is projected to decrease by 27 million metric tons during 2025 along with production declines from Indonesia. Key Takeaway: We see that national coal production and exports may miss the 2025 target, judging by the data since the beginning of the year. This is in line with the potential for several issuers' production targets not being met due to weak production in 1Q25. We predict coal prices have the potential to trade flat in the range of 90-100 US dollars per ton during 2025, assuming: 1) weak industrial activity in Asia - especially India and China - due to US tariff policies; and 2) high coal inventories in China.",

      "content": "1. A survey conducted by Bloomberg indicated that the consensus among analysts and investors expects the US will maintain a 30% tariff on China until the end of 2025. Although this tariff is much lower than before, a 30% tariff could eliminate 70% of exports from China to the US in the medium term, according to projections from Bloomberg Economics. 2. Bloomberg reported that since the beginning of May 2025, the IHSG has recorded a net foreign inflow of 83.8 million US dollars as of May 15, 2025. If this trend continues, the IHSG has the potential to end the 7-month net foreign outflow trend. Bloomberg reports that the inflow trend since the beginning of May 2025 could indicate that foreign investor interest in the IHSG has returned after investor confidence in recent months was eroded by concerns regarding economic growth slowdown, government fiscal policy, and global trade tensions. 3. Reuters reported that SKK Migas on Thursday (15/5) approved Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC) to develop the Anambas block, Riau Islands. KUFPEC will invest approximately 1.54 billion US dollars to develop the Anambas block to produce 55 million standard cubic feet per day of gas, with an estimated total gas sales volume of 185 billion cubic feet. KUFPEC plans to reach a final investment decision in early 2026, with production expected to start in 2028. KUFPEC CEO, Eisa Al-Maraghi, stated that they view Indonesia as a strategic location for expansion. 4. Malaysia and Indonesia plan to increase LNG import capacity, according to Takuya Tanabe, Head of Asian LNG Origination at JERA Global Markets. Takuya said that this could create a shift in global LNG market dynamics, considering Malaysia and Indonesia were the 5th and 6th largest LNG exporters in the world in 2024, respectively. Previously, Bloomberg reported in January 2025 that the Indonesian government had asked domestic LNG exporters to postpone shipments this year due to increasing domestic energy demand. 5. Bloomberg reported that Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA) is in negotiations with BPI Danantara regarding a capital injection to improve the company's finances. Bloomberg sources stated that the discussions are still in the early stages and subject to change, and details regarding the amount of the capital injection are still under discussion. Representatives of GIAA and BPI Danantara have not commented on this issue. 6. Apexindo Pratama Duta ($APEX) secured a contract valued at 25 million US dollars from PT Pertamina Hulu Mahakam for offshore drilling in the Mahakam Delta area, East Kalimantan, for a period of 1 year. 7. The controller of PAM Mineral ($NICL), Christopher Sumasto Tjia, purchased approximately 1.3 million NICL shares at an average price of 1,047 rupiah per share on May 15, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 1.3 billion rupiah. Following this transaction, Christopher's direct ownership in NICL increased from 0.259% to 0.271%.",
