      "content": "Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI) officially listed on the IDX today, Thursday (5/12). Amidst the buzz regarding short-term trading opportunities from AADI's IPO, we assess that investors can also consider fundamental factors for long-term investment in AADI, especially regarding dividend yield. \n- Valuation has potential for Re-rating to 5-7x P/E. We estimate AADI's net profit in FY25F will decrease to the level of USD 934 million (-27.5% YoY) due to the loss of one-off gain from subsidiary sales, with core profit only decreasing by -3.2% YoY. However, considering its low IPO valuation (2.9x P/E FY25F), we see AADI having quite high upside potential with a re-rating opportunity to 5x P/E FY25F (9,650 rupiah per share, +74% from the IPO price). We consider the valuation of AADI at 5x P/E as reasonable and conservative because it is lower than the 5-year historical average P/E of its parent company, Alamtri Resources Indonesia ($ADRO), at 6.9x P/E. This valuation is also between Bukit Asam ($PTBA) at 7.3x P/E FY25F and Indo Tambangraya Megah ($ITMG) at 4.8x P/E FY25F. If AADI can re-rate to ADRO's 5-year historical average P/E (6.9x) and become similar to PTBA's valuation at ~7x PE, this implies a price of 13,525 rupiah per share (+144% from the IPO price).\n- Dividend Yield up to ~17% with 50% DPR Assumption. Besides the outlook for Newcastle coal prices which we expect will not significantly decrease, we see AADI's potential for re-rating will also be driven by prospects for the 2025 fiscal year dividend, which we estimate can reach ~966 rupiah per share. This amount indicates a dividend yield of approximately 17% based on AADI's IPO share price (5,550 rupiah per share). This dividend size assumes a dividend payout ratio (DPR) of 50%, which is the average DPR of ADRO over the last 3 years. This dividend yield is higher compared to other major coal companies, such as ITMG and PTBA. Although management stated in the prospectus that they plan to distribute dividends with a DPR of up to 45%, we consider the assumption of a 50% DPR not to be aggressive considering the company currently has no major capex plans in the near future. With a 50% DPR and the level of annual net profit generated by the company, we also assess that AADI still has adequate funds if at any time it decides to develop its 2 coal mines, namely Pari Coal and Ratah Coal.\n- Main Assumptions in Our Analysis:\n  - Average Newcastle coal price of USD 135 per ton in 2024 and USD 130 per ton in 2025, reflecting normalization from the current level of USD 134.8 per ton.\n  - Sales volume of 63 million tons in 2024 (-0.6% YoY) and 64 million tons in 2025 (+1.6% YoY).\n  - Cash costs of USD 56.2 per ton in 2024 (-12% YoY) and USD 57.8 per ton in 2025 (+2.9% YoY).\n  - Non-operating income decreased significantly in 2025 (-89.4% YoY) along with the loss of one-off gain from the disposal of investment assets.\nKey Takeaway: Although it seems many investors bought AADI based on short-term trading opportunities, we see AADI can be a good fundamental investment opportunity, especially with a relatively stable coal outlook and significant, routine dividend yield. Starting Friday (6/12) until Tuesday (10/12) at 10:00 AM WIB, investors who have the right to exercise AADI's PUPS ([$ADRO-H](-H)) can perform the exercise on the Stockbit application. Dividends eligible for exercising ADRO-H will be credited on Friday (6/12).\nWith AADI's increase of +19.8% to the level of 6,650 rupiah per share today (5/12), the exercise price is 5,971 rupiah per share (including the 0.18% transaction fee imposed based on the PUPS prospectus).\nHere is how to exercise ADRO-H on Stockbit:\n1. Swipe right on ADRO-H on the Portfolio page, then click Exercise.\n2. Enter the amount of ADRO-H you want to exercise. Then click Exercise.",
