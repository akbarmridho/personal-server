      "content": "Mastersystem Infotama (MSTI) posted a strong net profit of 149 billion rupiah in 3Q24 (+79% YoY, +155% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 9M24 to 312 billion rupiah (+63% YoY), equivalent to 59% of Stockbit's FY24 projected net profit. We assess this 9M24 realization as exceeding expectations, considering that MSTI's net profit in 9M23 was only equivalent to 43% of the FY23 realization. In general, the rapid net profit growth was driven by: 1) strong revenue; and 2) efficient operating expenses (opex). MSTI recorded revenue of 1.6 trillion rupiah in 3Q24 (+83% YoY, +119% QoQ), resulting in 9M24 revenue growing +52% YoY to 3.5 trillion rupiah. As we wrote in the 2Q24 performance highlights note, MSTI still has a new contract backlog of 2.4 trillion rupiah that had not been booked as revenue as of 1H24 and began to be booked in 3Q24. MSTI management itself provided a revenue growth guidance of +19-24% during FY24. On the other hand, the gross profit margin decreased to 15.8% in 3Q24 (vs. 3Q23: 21%, 2Q24: 19.1%). We expect this lower margin to possibly be caused by large projects with relatively smaller margins. However, we assess that the large contract value has a positive aspect from the opex side, reflected in overall opex efficiency. Opex in 3Q24 was recorded at only 78 billion rupiah (+17% YoY, +6% QoQ), growing much slower compared to the increase in revenue. As a bonus, MSTI also booked other income of 21 billion rupiah in 3Q24 (3Q23: 1 billion rupiah, 2Q24: 4 billion rupiah), which we estimate is related to the reversal of impairment provision expense for receivables. MSTI will hold an earnings call soon, where we will confirm the dynamics of the gross margin and opex mentioned above, as well as the progress of new contracts obtained by the company. Key Takeaway As we wrote in the 3Q24 Stock Ideas, MSTI's performance is expected to accelerate in 2H24, which is reflected in the 3Q24 performance realization. Although it is difficult to predict the specific 4Q24 net profit realization due to seasonality in the company's business, we are confident that our net profit estimate of 531 billion rupiah will be achieved or even exceeded. Based on our FY24 net profit estimate, MSTI is trading at a P/E valuation of 9.1x, a level that we consider attractive.",

At the operational level, operating profit in 3Q24 reached US$6 million (+99% QoQ, +119% YoY). The quarterly decline in net profit in 3Q24 was due to a high-base effect resulting from a US$17.4 million one-off gain from the sale of 3 vessels in 2Q24.
