This result caused the PBT from the 'trade and distribution' segment to grow +30% YoY in 1H25, mainly supported by the low-base effect in 1H24 due to RKAB permit issues for customers in the mining segment. Moving forward, AKRA management sees potential weakening of fuel demand volume from mining clients due to weakening mining commodity prices. To address this issue, management will optimize fuel volume sales to existing industrial clients (non-mining) and the retail segment (bp AKR). Management explained that fuel sales volume from the industrial segment stabilized at a high level, after new clients acquired by the company in 1H24 started becoming repeat customers. Regarding the change in RKAB duration from once every 3 years to once every 1 year, AKRA management stated that the company is accustomed to this system. Nevertheless, management is still awaiting official regulations from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources regarding implementation technicalities.",
