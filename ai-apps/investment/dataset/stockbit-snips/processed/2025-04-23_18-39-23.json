      "content": "1. US President, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday (22/4) that he has no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome Powell. Trump stated that he only wants to see Powell be more proactive in the 'idea of lowering interest rates.' Rumors that Trump planned to fire Powell emerged after the Director of the US National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, said last week that Trump was studying whether he was able to fire Powell. 2. Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (23/4) decided to maintain the BI Rate at 5.75%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5% and 6.5% respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations. 3. Bank Indonesia noted that credit growth slowed to +9.16% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 2M25: +10.3% YoY), below Bank Indonesia's 2025 target range of +11-13% YoY. Based on use, investment credit grew +13.36% YoY, consumption credit +9.32% YoY, and working capital +6.51% YoY. Meanwhile, Sharia financing in 1Q25 grew +9.18% YoY and MSME credit growth reached +1.95% YoY. 4. The IMF cut its global growth projections for 2025 and 2026 to +2.8% YoY and +3% YoY respectively, following the escalation of the global trade war. These projections are lower compared to the outlook in January 2025, where the IMF projected global economic growth of +3.3% YoY for both 2025 and 2026. The IMF also cut its projection for Indonesia's economic growth in 2025 and 2026 to +4.7% YoY, lower than the January 2025 outlook which projected growth of +5.1% YoY for both years. 5. US President, Donald Trump, said on Tuesday (22/4) that the US will set its own terms if China does not agree to a trade deal, although he did not elaborate further. Trump also said he would be very kind in negotiations with the Chinese government. Trump added that Chinese import tariffs would drop significantly after the deal is finalized, but not to zero. 6. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on Tuesday (22/4) that CPO demand from China and India is expected to increase because CPO prices currently at 3,900 ringgit per ton are relatively reasonable compared to competing commodities. China and India are major importers of CPO. On Wednesday (23/4), CPO traders in India also told Reuters that India began increasing CPO purchases as their prices are currently cheaper than soybean oil. 7. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, claimed on Wednesday (23/4) that Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt will replace LG Energy Solution as the strategic investor in the electric vehicle battery project with the Indonesian government. Previously, the consortium led by LG announced its withdrawal from the project early this week. Bahlil claimed there would be no change to the basic plan of the project, with groundbreaking planned for the end of 2025. Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt has not yet responded to Bahlil's claim. 8. National Economic Council member, Agus Puji Prasetyono, said on Tuesday (22/4) that the first nuclear power plant (PLTN) in Indonesia is designed to have an initial capacity of 2x250 MW. Priority locations for construction are spread across several provinces: West Kalimantan, Bangka Belitung, Southeast Sulawesi, and Halmahera Island. The PLTN project itself will be controlled directly by the government, with international cooperation prioritized in the form of government-to-government arrangements. Last week, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, claimed that the government targets the first PLTN to begin operating in 2030 or 2032. 9. Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said on Tuesday (22/4) that he will begin reducing his time at the US Government Efficiency Department (DOGE) starting in May 2025. Musk's statement came amid worsening operational performance for Tesla in 1Q25, where car sales dropped -20% YoY and net profit plummeted -71% YoY. BBC reported that Musk's involvement in politics has caused protests and boycotts of Tesla cars.",

      "title": "BBCA 1Q25 Net Profit +9.8% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia ($BBCA) recorded a net profit of 14.1 trillion rupiah in 1Q25 (+9.8% YoY, +2.8% QoQ), relatively in line with expectations (24% of consensus 2025F estimates). Net profit growth was driven by solid operational performance, with: 1) Net Interest Income (NII) rising +7% YoY; and 2) opex contained, growing only +3% YoY, resulting in Pre-provision Operating Profit (PPOP) growing +10% YoY. On the other hand, asset quality deteriorated and is a concern for us. 1. Credit Growth Starting to Moderate. In headline terms, total credit still grew strongly by +13% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 2024: +14% YoY). However, BBCA management explained that this result was driven by a surge in short-term money market loans. Excluding these loans, total credit only grew around +10% YoY, starting to approach management's 2025 guidance in the range of +6-8% YoY. In addition to credit growth, solid CASA growth (+8% YoY) also contributed to NII growth of +7% YoY with NIM at the level of 5.8%, in line with guidance. The CASA Ratio is now at 82.9% as of 1Q25, increasing both annually and quarterly. BBCA management stated that the company will tend to be more cautious in disbursing financing, implying that credit growth will moderate until the end of 2025. The slowdown in credit growth is expected to be compensated by an increase in loan yield, where BBCA management sees room for loan repricing. 2. Asset Quality Deterioration. NPL rose to 2% in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: 1.9%, 4Q24: 1.8%) and LAR increased quarterly to 6% (vs. 1Q24: 6.6%, 4Q24: 5.3%). Cost of credit (CoC) was recorded at 0.5% (vs. 1Q24: 0.4%, 4Q24: -0.1%), higher than management's 2025 guidance of 0.3%. BBCA management explained that the NPL increase is related to debtors in the textile sector, while the LAR increase is due to the restructuring of debtors in the mineral sector. BBCA management explained that this restructuring will only be short-term, lasting a few months, and will be completed in 2Q25. Looking overall, BBCA management said that the asset quality condition is still quite manageable, so they have not decided to revise the CoC guidance upwards for this year. 3. Plans for Collaboration with BP Tapera in the People's Housing Program. Regarding reports of BBCA's plan to be involved in the people's housing program, BBCA management explained that the execution of this collaboration will be carried out carefully and gradually. From a business perspective, BBCA management said this program has a good margin, considering subsidies from BP Tapera. However, BBCA will be selective in participating, focusing only on housing that has a good ecosystem/infrastructure. Management is also open to a bullion bank program, although it still requires thorough calculation given the volatility of gold prices as the underlying asset and the necessary technical readiness. Key Takeaway. Overall, we assess BBCA's performance in 1Q25 is still solid. Matters that investors need to watch closely include: 1) the success of loan repricing to compensate for the slowdown in credit growth; and 2) asset quality developments amidst high uncertainty conditions. BBCA management stated that direct exposure to sectors/businesses exporting to the US is about 2% of total credit.",
