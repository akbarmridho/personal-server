      "content": "This is not the first time the Barito Group has sold a portion of its shares to increase the free float of shares outstanding in the market. Free float market cap (FFMC) itself is an important factor that can influence the weight, flow, and probability of a stock entering global indices such as the MSCI. Assuming ceteris paribus, stocks with larger free floats that have not yet entered a global index may have a greater probability of entering that index. Meanwhile, for stocks already in the index, higher free float can open up opportunities for the related stock to receive weight increases (upweighting). Stocks newly included in an index or experiencing a weight increase potentially receive foreign fund inflows (foreign inflow).",

      "content": "1. The IHSG closed stronger at +0.49% to the level of 7,931 in today's trading, Thursday (14/8), marking an all-time high closing level, driven by a net foreign inflow of 4.9 trillion rupiah in the last week. The Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar also strengthened by +0.52% today to the level of 16,110, marking the highest level since the beginning of 2025 and nearly erasing the year-to-date weakness (-0.05% YTD). 2. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its monthly report on Wednesday (13/8) projected that oil supply growth will reach 2.5 million barrels per day in 2025 and 1.9 million barrels per day in 2026, which is 370,000 barrels per day and 620,000 barrels per day higher, respectively, than the IEA's previous projections. The upward revision for oil supply projections is based on additional production from OPEC+ which decided to end part of its production cuts sooner than scheduled. On the demand side, the IEA projects world oil demand to increase by only 680,000 barrels per day in 2025 and 700,000 barrels per day in 2026, down 20,000 barrels per day from previous estimates due to persistently suppressed consumer confidence. 3. Reuters reported that the interest of Chinese companies in expanding or establishing businesses in Indonesia is increasing, driven by US import tariffs for Indonesia (19%) being lower compared to China (30%). Although not different from neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Thailand which are also subject to a 19% tariff, Reuters reported that Indonesia has a larger market share advantage compared to neighboring countries. VP Sales & Marketing of PT Suryacipta Swadaya, Abednego Purnomo, told Reuters that the Subang Smartpolitan area is flooded with inquiries from Chinese investors. PT Suryacipta Swadaya itself is the operator of the Subang Smartpolitan area and a subsidiary of Surya Semesta Internusa ($SSIA). 4. The industrial cement sales volume in Indonesia decreased annually to 5.8 million tons in July 2025 (-3.8% YoY, +18% MoM), according to data from Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa ($INTP) management. On a monthly basis, sales volume increased due to seasonality effects in the second half, mainly due to the growing number of working days in July 2025. This result causes the cement industry sales volume in Indonesia during 7M25 to decrease by -3.2% YoY (vs. 7M24 including Grobogan cement: +2.5% YoY), with weaknesses occurring both on the Java Island (-3.1% YoY) and outside Java Island (-3.3% YoY). INTP management expects that the industrial sales volume in 2025 may not exceed the realization in 2024, changing from the previous estimate which expected growth up to +2% YoY. In terms of segmentation, bagged cement sales volume was flat year-on-year during 7M25, with sales contribution increasing to 72% (vs. 7M24: 70%). On the other hand, bulk cement sales volume decreased by -10% YoY, with its contribution to total sales also decreasing to 28% (vs. 7M24: 30%). 5. Cikarang Listrindo ($POWR) announced that the company is currently experiencing a gas supply disruption from its suppliers, namely PT Pertamina EP and Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS). In response, POWR immediately took mitigation steps by utilizing other fuels to ensure the fulfillment of industrial customer energy needs without disruption until the gas supply from PT Pertamina EP and PGAS returns to normal. POWR is also assessing the potential impact of the gas supply disruption on the company's financial condition, and is coordinating with gas suppliers, regulators, and other stakeholders as a mitigation step to maintain the reliability of electricity supply operations.",
