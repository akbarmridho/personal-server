      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) recorded net profit of 4.7 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (-12% YoY, -12% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 10.1 trillion rupiah (-6% YoY), below expectations as it was only equivalent to 46% of the 2025F consensus estimate (vs. the average of the last 2 years: 50% annual realization). Net Profit Suppressed by Weak PPOP and Increased Provisions. Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) decreased by -5%/-2% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, along with Non-Interest Income which fell -2%/-3% YoY in 2Q25/1H25 amidst an opex increase of +5%/+3% YoY. Net Interest Income was relatively better, still up +0%/+2% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, although far below credit growth of +7% YoY as of June 2025, highlighting pressure on margins. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) in 2Q25 dropped to 3.7% (vs. 2Q24: 4%, 1Q25: 3.9%) due to high Cost of Fund, causing the NIM position in 1H25 to be at the level of 3.8% (vs. 1H24: 4%). Asset Quality. Provision expenses increased to 2 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (+15% YoY, +15% QoQ), resulting in total provision expenses for 1H25 reaching 3.8 trillion rupiah (+8% YoY). The NPL ratio itself stood at 1.9% in 2Q25 (vs. 2Q24: 2%, 1Q25: 2%), with the consumer segment experiencing an NPL increase to 2.1% (vs. 2Q24: 1.6%, 1Q25: 2%). This increase was mainly seen in the mortgage and auto financing sub-segments, which management attributed to weakened purchasing power. Involvement in Koperasi Desa Merah Putih. BBNI management did not provide a complete explanation regarding the company's involvement in Koperasi Desa Merah Putih. However, management stated that discussions with the government accommodated the interests of all stakeholders. In credit disbursement, the bank will carry out the assessment process for potential debtors, and the portion of credit disbursed is considered to still be manageable. Key Takeaway. The weakening performance in 2Q25 is in line with indications we wrote previously. Post-release of 1H25 performance, BBNI management lowered the NIM guidance for 2025 from the range of 4-4.2% to a minimum of 3.8%. This cut was made even though management forecasts that banking liquidity conditions will improve in 2H25 along with: 1) a decrease in SRBI yield and holdings; 2) a decrease in BI interest rates; and 3) acceleration of government spending. Meanwhile, guidance for credit growth (+8-10% YoY) and Cost of Credit (~1%) remained unchanged.",
