      "title": "US Labor Data Weak, Rate Cut Expectation Strengthens",
      "content": "The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded that non-farm payrolls in the United States increased by 73 thousand in July 2025, far below the consensus expectation of 110 thousand. The agency also significantly revised the non-farm payroll growth data for June 2025 from 147 thousand down to only 14 thousand, and the May 2025 data from 144 thousand to 19 thousand. Both revisions indicate that the labor market may be weakening faster than previously expected. In addition to the non-farm payroll data, the BLS also reported that the unemployment rate in the United States edged up to 4.2 % in July 2025 (versus 4.1 % in June 2025), in line with consensus expectations. The labor force participation rate fell by 0.1 percentage point to 62.2 %, marking the lowest level since November 2022, while the employment-to-population ratio also declined by 0.1 percentage point to 59.6 %, the weakest level since December 2021. In response to the labor-market release, market expectations for a U.S. interest-rate cut strengthened. According to analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability that the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points at the September 2025 meeting rose to 86 % as of today, Monday (4 / 8), compared with 63 % the previous week. Meanwhile, the probability of a rate cut of 50 basis points or more by the end of 2025 increased from 64 % to 91 % as of today. In addition, President Donald Trump fired the Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, following the labor-data announcement on Friday (1 / 8). Trump accused McEntarfer of manipulating the data, while Reuters reported that there is no evidence supporting Trump’s claim. A Trump administration official told Reuters that the administration is dissatisfied with inaccurate economic data—particularly the significant revisions to June and May 2025 non-farm payroll figures—and the declining response rate from respondents in the BLS surveys since the pandemic era. Besides the labor-data issue, surprising news came from Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler, who decided to resign on Friday (1 / 8). Kugler’s departure opens the possibility for Trump to place a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell on the Board of Governors earlier than expected. Previously, Trump was rumored to select and announce Powell’s successor in September or October 2025, aiming to weaken Powell’s position amid differing views on the direction of U.S. interest rates.",

Domestically, market participants will focus on government spending in the second half of 2025. Investors also need to monitor the presidential speech next week, which may highlight priority programs for 2026. The 2Q25 economic-growth data is scheduled for release on Tuesday (5 / 8).",

      "content": "Economists surveyed by Reuters estimate that Indonesia’s economic growth in 2Q25 will be only +4.8 % year-on-year (versus 4.87 % in 2Q25), marking the lowest growth in four years. On a quarterly basis, Indonesia’s economy is projected to grow +3.7 % quarter-on-quarter (versus -0.98 % QoQ in 1Q25). OPEC+ on Sunday (3 / 8) agreed to increase oil production by 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025, continuing the incremental production rise that started in April 2025 to regain market share. OPEC+ said the move was taken amid a healthy economy and low inventories. The latest step will complement the recovery from a voluntary output cut of 2.2 million barrels per day that eight members implemented in 2023. In addition, the United Arab Emirates will receive a gradual quota increase. OPEC+ still maintains another layer of voluntary cuts of about 1.66 million barrels and a cut of 2 million barrels per day, each scheduled to run until the end of 2026. OPEC+ will meet again on 7 September 2025. BPS recorded that Indonesia’s coal export value in the first half of 2025 reached approximately US$12 billion (-21.1 % year-on-year), with export volume falling to about 184.2 million tonnes (-6.33 % YoY) and the average price dropping to about US$65 per tonne (-15.9 % YoY). Malaysia’s palm-oil stock is expected to surge to 2.23 million tonnes in July 2025, according to a Bloomberg survey. The figure represents the highest level since December 2023, implying a month-on-month increase of +9.9 % and a year-on-year rise of +27.4 % compared with official data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board for June 2025 and July 2024. Official data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board will be released on 11 August 2025. The head of research at Sunvin Group, Anilkumar Bagani, told Bloomberg that Malaysia’s palm-oil stock is expected to rise in July 2025 due to a production surge and lower consumption that month. Bagani added that palm-oil stocks above 2 million tonnes during the peak production season are unlikely to heavily burden prices, given that Indonesia’s palm-oil supply will be limited by the mandatory B40 biodiesel.",
