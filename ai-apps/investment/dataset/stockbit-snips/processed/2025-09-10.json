      "title": "New Finance Minister Promises to Keep APBN Deficit Under 3% of GDP and Ease Liquidity",
      "content": "Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa assured that his ministry will keep the state budget deficit below 3% of GDP and emphasized that there is no need to impose new taxes, aligning with the stance of his predecessor Sri Mulyani. Purbaya also said that the government plans to inject about IDR 200 trillion of cash reserves held at Bank Indonesia into the banking system to improve liquidity and stimulate credit distribution, which is expected to create jobs. In a joint meeting with the House of Representatives on Wednesday (10/9), Purbaya noted that tight liquidity had caused Indonesia's economy to slow down over the past year. He highlighted that slow government spending had led to an increase in the government's cash reserve at Bank Indonesia to IDR 430 trillion. Purbaya stated that the liquidity injection plan had been discussed with senior Bank Indonesia deputies so that the funds would not be re-absorbed by the central bank but instead be utilized by commercial banks. The statement came amid foreign investor concerns about fiscal discipline after President Prabowo Subianto replaced Sri Mulyani as finance minister. Sri Mulyani had been seen as a symbol of fiscal credibility during the last three administrations, according to Bloomberg. Purbaya said he would not take unconventional steps and would focus on accelerating government programs and improving liquidity to boost economic growth without increasing the government's debt burden. Previously, Purbaya claimed that Indonesia's economy could grow above 6% year-on-year in the near term and could potentially reach the President's target of 8% year-on-year growth. The 2025 APBN outlook projects economic growth of 4.7-5% year-on-year, while the 2026 RAPBN targets 5.4% year-on-year growth.",

The gain was led by the Financials sector (+1.33%), driven by higher prices of big-bank stocks, likely also influenced by the positive sentiment from the government's liquidity-easing plan, a key issue for the banking sector. As an illustration, the Loan-to-Deposit (LDR) ratios for the big four banks as of June 2025 (excluding BMRI for May 2025) are: BMRI 93.1%, BBNI 86.2%, BBRI 85%, and BBCA 78%.",
