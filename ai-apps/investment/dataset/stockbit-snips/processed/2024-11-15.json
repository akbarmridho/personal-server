      "title": "Powell Signals Slower Rate Cut Pace",
      "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday (14 November) that the Fed does not need to rush to cut interest rates given the current economy which is 'very good'. Powell's statement came one day after the release of US October 2024 inflation data, which rose to 2.6% year‑on‑year (versus September 2024: 2.4% YoY), ending a six‑month downward trend. Powell emphasized that the Fed still considers inflation to be on a sustainable path toward the 2% target, allowing the central bank to move policy rates to a more neutral level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth. The exact neutral rate and the speed at which the Fed will reach it remain unknown. Meanwhile, US economic growth and inflation outlook face uncertainty from protectionist policies expected from President‑elect Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing Powell’s less dovish remarks, analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of a 25‑basis‑point Fed rate cut at the December 2024 meeting fell sharply, from 82.5% on 13 November to 58.9% on Friday (15 November). Likewise, the probability of a cut of 75 basis points or more by June 2025 dropped from 47% to 34% over the past week, while the probability of a cut of less than 75 basis points by June 2025 rose from 53% to 66%.\n\nOn Thursday (14 November) US equity markets fell together, with the S&P 500 down 0.60%, Nasdaq down 0.64%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.47%. The US dollar index (DXY) rose 0.09% on Thursday, although it weakened 0.1% to 106.56 by Friday afternoon (15 November).\n\nThe Indonesian composite index (IHSG) closed down 0.74% today, while the 10‑year Indonesian government bond yield fell 4 basis points to 6.92%. The rupiah weakened intraday by 0.6% before closing flat at 15,855 per US dollar, mainly supported by Bank Indonesia intervention. Bank Indonesia’s Head of Monetary Management and Securities Assets, Edi Susianto, told Bloomberg that the fundamental level of the rupiah is stronger than 16,000 per US dollar.\n\nKey Takeaway: A slower or smaller Fed rate‑cut trajectory in 2025 could reduce the space for Bank Indonesia to lower the BI Rate. Bloomberg consensus projects that Bank Indonesia will cut rates by a total of 100 basis points by the end of 2025. From a market perspective, although foreign outflows from the IHSG continue after Trump’s victory, the outflow value has shrunk to about IDR 517 billion, indicating that most selling pressure may already be priced in.",
