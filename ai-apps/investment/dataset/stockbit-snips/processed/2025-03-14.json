The target follows GoTo reporting adjusted EBITDA of positive Rp399 billion in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: positive Rp89 billion, 3Q24: positive Rp137 billion). This result brought 2024 adjusted EBITDA to positive Rp386 billion (vs. 2023: negative Rp2.3 trillion), surpassing the company's guidance that aimed for breakeven. At the bottom line, net loss narrowed to Rp1.1 trillion in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: net loss Rp80.4 trillion, 3Q24: net loss Rp655 billion), resulting in a 2024 net loss of Rp3.1 trillion (vs. 2023: net loss Rp87 trillion). ODS segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of positive Rp267 billion in 4Q24 (+12% YoY, +71% QoQ), the highest ever, driven by revenue growth and margin expansion. GoTo expects ODS growth in 2025 to align with the industry, projected to grow low‑mid teens. The company continues to innovate ODS through technology, such as a special delivery fleet that reduces costs and enables competitive pricing, and it boosted advertising revenue (+92% YoY in 4Q24). In the Fintech segment, financing volume rose to Rp5.2 trillion at the end of 2024 (vs. 9M24: Rp4.3 trillion, 2023: Rp1.9 trillion). GoTo aims for financing above Rp8 trillion by the end of 2025. Management said asset quality remains fairly good, though specific metrics were not disclosed. The loan tenor is generally short, averaging three months excluding vehicle financing, allowing rapid adaptation to changing conditions. Regarding share buyback, GoTo disclosed that it repurchased 23.6 billion shares worth about US$91 million or Rp1.5 trillion by the end of February 2025, implying an average purchase price of roughly Rp64 per share. The company has allocated a US$200 million buyback budget. On the rumored merger with Grab Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: GRAB), management said it could not comment and chose to stay focused on executing its strategy, given the still large market potential. Finally, the company said it will provide holiday allowance (THR) to productive, high‑performing partners and will manage the additional cost within its planned budget.",
