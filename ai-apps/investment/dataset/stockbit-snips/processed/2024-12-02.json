      "title": "Average Minimum Wage Increase +6.5% in 2025",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto announced that the average increase in the minimum wage for 2025 will be +6.5%. In general, this increase is in line with the upper bound estimate we previously wrote in Stockbit Snips, which implies a larger alpha variable. However, the government has not yet released the regulation regarding the formula used to calculate the minimum wage increase. Labour Minister Yassierli said that the new ministerial regulation on the minimum wage will be released on Wednesday (4/12). The regulation will replace Government Regulation No. 51/2023 on wages, which was annulled by the Constitutional Court in October 2024 after the labour cluster was removed from the Omnibus Law. Yassierli hopes that regional governments can quickly release adjustment rules for their respective regions, with the target that provincial minimum wages (UMP) and district/city minimum wages (UMK) for 2025 can be announced before Christmas 2024. Following the news of the minimum wage increase, the Chairman of the Indonesian Employers Association, Shinta Kamdani, assessed the +6.5% adjustment as too large, potentially triggering layoffs and hindering new job creation. On the other hand, the Chairman of the Indonesian Labour Union (KSPI) and the Labour Party, Said Iqbal, said that workers will cancel the planned national strike because an agreement on the minimum wage increase has been reached. Realisation of the minimum wage increase at the regional level can deviate from the central government’s set increase. The detailed breakdown is shown in the accompanying chart. Key Takeaway: The +6.5% figure will become a reference for each region. Compared with the average realised increase across all Indonesian regions in recent years, the increase is higher than in 2024 and is relatively high over the past three years, although not as high as in 2023.",
