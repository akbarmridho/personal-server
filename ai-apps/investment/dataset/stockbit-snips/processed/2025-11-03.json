Although some issuers still recorded performance below expectations, this time the number was not as high as when 2Q25 results were released. In fact, several issuers/sectors recorded results that exceeded expectations/showed solid recovery in 3Q25, such as $UNVR, tobacco ($HMSP and $GGRM), and dairy ($CMRY and $ULTJ). Meanwhile, $ACES, $MYOR, and $TLKM still recorded performance below consensus expectations. With the 3Q25 results, we generally see that the risk of downward revision of performance estimates tends to be limited and could even be revised upwards along with expectations for economic recovery starting in 4Q25.",

Nevertheless, companies tended to be cautious about passing on cost increases to customers, so selling prices only increased slightly as an effort to maintain price competitiveness.
