      "content": "Vale Indonesia ($INCO) recorded a net profit of 7 million US dollars in 4Q24 (-51.9% QoQ, -81.6% YoY). This result brings the net profit for 2024 to 58 million US dollars (-78.9% YoY), below expectations as it only met 87.7%/82.5% of Stockbit/consensus estimates. Although revenue in 4Q24 (+5.2% QoQ) managed to grow quarterly, net profit decreased primarily due to a rise in operating expenses (+111.4% QoQ) and other income reversing to a loss of 4 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24: profit of 12 million US dollars).\n\n- Rise in Operating Expenses and Reversal of Other Income\n\nThe increase in operating expenses was driven by rises in all operating expense lines, which we estimate are related to the opening of new pits in Pomalaa and Bahodopi. Meanwhile, the reversal of other income was mainly caused by a reversal of profit from the recognition of the fair value of derivative assets (related to additional participation rights in the HPAL smelter project) turning into a loss of 10 million US dollars (vs. 3Q24: profit of 9 million US dollars).\n\n- Potential Addition to Nickel Ore Production and Sales Volume\n\nINCO recorded nickel matte production of 18,528 tons in 4Q24 (+2.9% QoQ), bringing the total nickel matte production volume for 2024 to 71,311 tons (+0.8% YoY) and slightly higher than the target level of 70,805 tons. INCO has the potential to record higher nickel ore production and sales volumes in the coming years, following the opening of new pits in Pomalaa and Bahodopi. Based on guidance from management, INCO potentially records an additional sale of 1.7 million wmt of saprolite in 2025, consisting of 1.4 million wmt from Bahodopi and 300,000 wmt from Pomalaa. Previously, INCO did not sell saprolite nickel ore and only sold nickel in matte form.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe see the prospect of INCO's performance recovery going forward being influenced by: 1) the trend of nickel prices amid an oversupply condition; 2) the company's efforts in efficiency; and 3) sales volume growth from the contribution of nickel ore from new pits in Pomalaa and Bahodopi.",
