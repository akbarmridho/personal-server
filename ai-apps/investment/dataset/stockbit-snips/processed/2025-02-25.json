      "title": "Government Said to Soon Lift iPhone 16 Sales Ban",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government and Apple Inc. have agreed on terms to lift the ban on the sale of the iPhone 16 series in Indonesia, ending five months of negotiations that led Apple to increase its investment offer by 100 times to US$1 billion. Bloomberg cited that the Ministry of Industry will sign a memorandum of agreement with Apple this week. Neither Apple nor the Ministry has commented on the news. In addition to the US$1 billion investment, Bloomberg said Apple will commit to training local communities in research and development (R&D) through programs beyond the existing Apple Developer Academy. Bloomberg also reported that Apple does not plan to produce iPhones in Indonesia immediately. In December 2024 Bloomberg reported that the US$1 billion investment included building an AirTag factory in Batam targeting 20% of global AirTag production. The agreement news came almost two months after Minister of Industry Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita met Apple Vice President of Global Policy Nick Ammann in early January 2025, where the minister said the US$1 billion investment was insufficient and urged Apple to build an iPhone component factory in Indonesia to obtain a domestic component certificate (TKDN). Last week, Agus said Apple had paid an investment debt of US$10 million, the remaining commitment from the 2020-2024 period. Key Takeaway: The lifting of the iPhone 16 sales ban in Indonesia could boost sales of Apple product distributors such as ERAA and MAPI.",

Monetization refers to the government borrowing from the central bank instead of issuing bonds to private investors or raising taxes. Lionel Priyadi, Fixed Income and Macro Strategist at PT Mega Capital, told Bloomberg that the government should clarify the housing bond structure, otherwise the market may interpret the issuance as a potential widening of the fiscal deficit, which could push up government bond yields.",
