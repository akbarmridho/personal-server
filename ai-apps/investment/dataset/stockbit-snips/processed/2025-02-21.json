      "title": "One of Indonesia's Largest Nickel Smelters Reported Near Total Shutdown",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry – one of the largest nickel smelters in Indonesia – has cut production and is almost completely shut down. The news emerged only a few months after its Chinese parent, Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., went bankrupt. Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry is the third-largest stainless-steel producer in China. Bloomberg said PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry has delayed payments to local energy suppliers and cannot obtain nickel ore, and has shut almost all production lines since early 2025. Bloomberg noted that PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry has a total nickel pig iron (NPI) production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per year. In addition, Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry also owns other nickel smelters and stainless-steel plants in Indonesia, such as PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry and PT Obsidian Stainless Steel. A Reuters report from July 2024 said that a key factor behind Jiangsu Delong’s bankruptcy was the deteriorating performance of its Indonesian joint venture due to lower ferronickel prices and higher material costs at the end of 2023. The same Reuters report also said that some industry players expect the Chinese operations to be partially taken over by Chinese state-owned enterprises. CRU Group analyst Kevin Bai told Reuters that a company the size of Jiangsu Delong is “too big to fail” and that bankruptcy reorganisation is not new in China.\n\nKey Takeaway\nThe production cut at PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry could reduce Indonesia’s nickel pig iron supply, potentially pushing global nickel pig iron prices higher, given Indonesia’s status as the world’s largest nickel pig iron producer. PT Gunbuster’s smelter capacity represents roughly 20 % of Indonesia’s total nickel pig iron capacity of 9 million tonnes per year, based on 2022 data. Nickel pig iron prices have been gaining +4.5 % year-to-date.\n\nOn Friday (21 Feb), the stocks of nickel producers rose, with $NCKL up +7.26 % and $INCO up +4.45 %, while $MBMA rose +3.18 % to 390 IDR per share before closing flat.",
