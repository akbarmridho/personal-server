      "content": "The Ministry of Finance held another briefing (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKTy4NU0szw) on the realization of the 2025 State Budget (APBN) on Tuesday, 17 June. The main points are as follows: Revenue fell due to weaker tax receipts. State revenue for the first five months of 2025 (5M25) declined by 11.4% year-on-year, reaching only 33% of the 2025 APBN target (versus 40% in 5M24). The decline was mainly caused by tax revenue, which fell 10.1% YoY. Deputy Finance Minister Anggito Abimanyu attributed the drop in tax receipts to restitution factors, noting that gross tax revenue remains flat on an annual basis. At the end of May 2025 the government appointed a new Director General of Taxation, Bimo Wijayanto (link: https://news.ddtc.co.id/berita/nasional/1811040/baru-jadi-dirjen-pajak-ini-tugas-awal-bimo-wijayanto). Expenditure also started to rise in May 2025. Government spending for 5M25 also fell about 11% YoY, reaching only 28% of the 2025 APBN target (versus 34% in 5M24). The decline occurred amid efficiency initiatives ordered by President Prabowo Subianto since January 2025 (link: https://djpk.kemenkeu.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Inpres-1-Tahun-2025.pdf). Nevertheless, Deputy Finance Minister Suahasil Nazara said that spending surged in May 2025 as program reallocations within the budget became identified. In the next two months, spending is expected to be boosted by an economic stimulus of approximately IDR 24 trillion in June-July 2025 (link: https://setkab.go.id/presiden-prabowo-gulirkan-paket-stimulus-ekonomi-rp2444-triliun-untuk-jaga-momentum-pertumbuhan/). The realization of revenue and spending for 5M25 resulted in a deficit of IDR 21 trillion, equivalent to 0.09% of GDP, still far below the 2025 target of 2.53% of GDP. Sugar-sweetened beverage tax in packaged form (MBDK) was cancelled for this year. During the same briefing, Director General of Customs and Excise Djaka Budi Utama announced that the excise on packaged sweetened beverages will not be applied this year, although it may be introduced later (link: https://ekonomi.bisnis.com/read/20250617/259/1885747/resmi-cukai-minuman-manis-tidak-akan-berlaku-tahun-ini). Previously, at the beginning of 2025, the Director of Communication and User Guidance of Customs, Nirwala Dwi Heryanto, said the government planned to implement the MBDK tax in the second half of 2025, targeting revenue of IDR 3.8 trillion in the 2025 APBN. Key Takeaway: We assess that the accelerating trend in government spending will be a key factor to support economic growth in the second half of 2025, especially amid rising global uncertainty from US trade policy and geopolitical tensions. Low spending has been one of the reasons for the weak economic growth in 1Q25 (link: https://snips.stockbit.com/snips-terbaru/ekonomi-ri-487-yoy-pada-1q25-terlemah-sejak-3q21). At the same time, the postponement of the MBDK tax may provide temporary relief for several issuers, namely $MYOR, $SIDO, $ULTJ, $CMRY and $ICBP.",
