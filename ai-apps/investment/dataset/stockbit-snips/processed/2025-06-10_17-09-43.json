      "title": "Car Sales Worsen in May 2025",
      "content": "Gaikindo recorded that national car sales (wholesales) in May 2025 reached 60,613 units (-15% YoY, +18% MoM), resulting in 5M25 wholesales declining to 316,981 units (-5% YoY) or equivalent to 35-42% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 5M24: 38.7% realization in 2024). The sharp annual decline in May 2025 worsened the wholesales trend compared to the 4M25 realization which was at the level of -3% YoY. The Chairman of Gaikindo, Jongkie Sugiarto, attributed this decline to the weakening purchasing power of the community. By brand, the two main brands of Astra International ($ASII) - Toyota + Daihatsu - jointly recorded a wholesales decline of -16% YoY in May 2025, relatively in line with the industry decline (-15% YoY). Outside of ASII, other Japanese brands experienced a much sharper decline in May 2025, with Mitsubishi and Honda dropping around -30% YoY, while Honda dropped up to -57% YoY. On the other hand, sales of Chinese brands still grew strongly in May 2025, with Wuling up +72% YoY and Chery +106% YoY. With this May 2025 realization, Japanese brands experienced a market share decline during 5M25 along with a deeper wholesales decline compared to the industry decline. The market share of Japanese brands continues to be taken by Chinese brands which recorded a positive trend in wholesales growth during 5M25.",

      "content": "Although the market seems to already have low expectations for car sales, a worsening sales decline needs to be watched by investors. The factor of weakening purchasing power mentioned by Gaikindo is consistent with comments from Autopedia Sukses Lestari 's ($ASLC) management in the 1Q25 earnings call. ASLC management revealed that even though the trend of switching from new vehicle purchases to used vehicles is still occurring, the company sees some of the lowest sub-segments of the community choosing not to buy a vehicle even a used one, which emphasizes the purchasing power challenge. Furthermore, there is also a trend of tightening from the financing industry - such as higher down payment requirements - which negatively impacts car sales.",

      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, said on Friday (6/6) that the decision regarding the next Fed chair will be out soon. Reuters reported that former Fed governor, Kevin Warsh, is Trump's favorite candidate to fill the Fed chair position after Jerome Powell's term ends in 2026. Trump on Friday (6/6) also urged the Fed to cut interest rates by 100 bps, reiterating his view that Powell was too slow in lowering interest rates. Commodity analysis firm, Kpler, noted that thermal coal import volume in Asia reached ~74.1 million tons in May 2025, growing +8.1% MoM although still down -5.3% YoY. This result marks the highest monthly thermal coal import volume in the last 5 months amid increased coal production from major importing countries, such as China and India. Cumulatively during 5M25, Asian thermal coal import volume reached ~347 million tons (-7% YoY). Reuters reported that the recovery in Asian coal import volume in May 2025 occurred amidst weak coal prices from Indonesia and Australia to a four-year low, pressured by increased domestic supply from China and India. China's national statistics bureau recorded a consumer price index (CPI) deflation of 0.1% YoY in May 2025 (vs. Apr 2025: deflation 0.1% YoY), better than consensus expectations which predicted deflation of 0.2% YoY although marking the fourth consecutive month of annual deflation. On a monthly basis, China experienced deflation of 0.2% MoM (vs. Apr 2025: inflation 0.1% MoM), marking the third monthly deflation so far in 2025. Meanwhile, core inflation rose to 0.6% YoY (vs. Apr 2025: inflation 0.5% YoY), marking the highest core inflation since January 2025. Bank Indonesia noted that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of May 2025 reached 152.5 billion US dollars, unchanged from the position at the end of April 2025. This development was influenced by tax and service receipts as well as oil and gas foreign exchange receipts, amidst the need for government foreign debt payments and the policy of stabilizing the rupiah exchange rate. The position of foreign exchange reserves at the end of May 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.4 months of imports or 6.2 months of imports and government foreign debt payments. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that non-farm payrolls in the US in May 2025 increased by 139,000 (vs. Apr 2025: increase of 147,000), exceeding consensus expectations which predicted an increase of 130,000. The US unemployment rate in May 2025 remained stable at 4.2%, in line with expectations and unchanged for 2 consecutive months. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said on Tuesday (10/6) that the government would not revoke PT Gag Nikel's permit and allowed the company to mine on Gag Island, Raja Ampat Regency until 2047. Bahlil stated that the permit for the subsidiary of Aneka Tambang ($ANTM) was granted because the government assessed that the company's mining process complied with the environmental impact analysis (AMDAL), even though environmental activists highlighted the environmental crisis impact arising from mining activities in Raja Ampat. On the other hand, the government on the same day announced the revocation of nickel mining business permits for 4 companies - namely, PT Anugerah Surya Pratama, PT Nurham, PT Mulia Raymond Perkasa, and PT Kawei Sejahtera Mining - in Raja Ampat Regency. Bahlil explained that the revocation of permits for these companies was based on environmental reasons and the government's assessment that their mining areas fell within the geopark area. Indonesia's poverty figure jumped drastically from 60.25% of the total population or 171.74 million people to 68.25% of the total population or 194.67 million people in 2024, based on the latest calculation from the World Bank. This increase was caused by a change in the World Bank's poverty standard, where the poverty standard in Indonesia as an upper-middle-income country increased from the level of 6.85 US dollars per person per day to 8.3 US dollars per person per day. The level of poverty in Indonesia based on World Bank data is much higher than the official data from BPS at 8.57% or ~24.06 million people as of September 2024. This significant difference is mainly due to BPS's approach which measures poverty based on the cost of basic needs and not using purchasing power parities like the World Bank.",

Although Grab did not detail potential future acquisitions, Bloomberg reported that Grab's announcement triggered speculation that the ride-hailing company is raising funds to take over GoTo Gojek Tokopedia. Grab's announcement came just a day after the company stated in an information disclosure that they are not currently in talks to acquire GOTO, indicating that Grab has stopped or at least postponed the rumored 7 billion US dollar acquisition plan amid concerns about potential monopoly lawsuits from regulators. Last week, Bloomberg also reported that the Indonesian Wealth Fund (BPI Danantara) began discussions with GOTO to acquire a minority stake in the merged entity between Grab and GOTO. Bloomberg sources stated that the discussion regarding minority ownership is still in the early stages and may not result in any transaction.",
