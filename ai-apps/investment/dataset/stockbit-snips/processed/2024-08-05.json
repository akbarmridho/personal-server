      "content": "IHSG fell -3.4% on Monday (5/8), marking the worst daily decline since May 2022, following negative sentiment from macroeconomic and global financial markets. The decline was driven by rising concerns of a US recession after the release of July 2024 employment data that was much worse than expectations, continued correction of US technology stocks after a rally earlier in the year, and a 12.4% drop in Japan's Nikkei 225 index after an unexpected hike in its policy rate. Geopolitical tensions also worsened with the potential for Iranian and Hezbollah retaliation against Israel. All sectoral indices of the IHSG fell today. Out of a total of 895 stocks, 592 weakened and only 62 rose.",
