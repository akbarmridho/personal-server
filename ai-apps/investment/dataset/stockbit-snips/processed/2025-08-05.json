      "title": "Indonesia Economy +5.12% YoY in 2Q25, Above Expectations",
      "content": "The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that Indonesia's economy grew by 5.12 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, compared with 5.05 percent YoY in 2Q24 and 4.87 percent YoY in 1Q25, surpassing the consensus forecast of 4.8 percent YoY. This result brings the 1H25 year-on-year growth to 4.99 percent. As context, the government is targeting a 5 percent YoY growth level based on the 2025 state budget, which has been downgraded, while Bank Indonesia’s 2025 target – also downgraded twice – is in the range of 4.6-5.4 percent YoY. On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded by 4.04 percent quarter-on-quarter, higher than the consensus estimate of 3.7 percent QoQ (versus -0.98 percent QoQ in 1Q25 and 3.79 percent QoQ in 2Q24).\\n\\nOn the expenditure side, the 2Q25 annual growth was driven by gross fixed capital formation (PMTB) / investment, which rose 6.99 percent YoY (versus 4.42 percent YoY in 2Q24 and 2.12 percent YoY in 1Q25), propelled by a 30.37 percent YoY increase in government capital spending. Household consumption grew 4.97 percent YoY (versus 4.93 percent YoY in 2Q24 and 4.95 percent YoY in 1Q25) as primary-goods spending and mobility improved.\\n\\nBy industry, the manufacturing sector contributed the most to growth, increasing 5.68 percent YoY (versus 3.95 percent YoY in 2Q24 and 4.55 percent YoY in 1Q25) and accounting for 1.13 percentage points of the total (versus 0.79 pp in 2Q24 and 0.93 pp in 1Q25), driven by palm-oil, iron and steel products. Other services (+11.31 percent YoY) and corporate services (+9.31 percent YoY) were the fastest-growing segments in 2Q25, supported by higher visitor numbers at recreational sites and increased activity by travel agencies and tour operators.\\n\\nGeographically, Sulawesi (+5.83 percent YoY) and Java (+5.24 percent YoY) recorded the highest growth rates. Sumatra (+4.96 percent YoY), Kalimantan (+4.95 percent YoY), Bali & Nusa Tenggara (+3.73 percent YoY), and Maluku & Papua (+3.33 percent YoY) posted lower growth than the national average.\\n\\nKey Takeaway: We assess that 2H25 growth will depend on (1) the impact of the United States tariff that will start to apply in August 2025, (2) acceleration of government spending, and (3) the trend of declining interest rates. Investors should also monitor the presidential speech scheduled for Friday, 15 August, which may highlight priority programs for 2026.",
