      "title": "ðŸ‘Ž US Manufacturing and Employment Data Weakens",
      "content": "Several US economic data points were released on Friday local time (1/11) with weak results. The released data were the Purchasing Manufacturing Index (PMI) and nonfarm payroll (NFP) - employment levels outside the agricultural sector. PMI Below 50, US Manufacturing Contracts for 7 Months The US Institute for Supply Management (ISM) documented that the Purchasing Manufacturing Index (PMI) in October 2024 dropped to 46.5 (vs September 2024: 47.2), the lowest since July 2023. This result signals contraction in the manufacturing sector for seven consecutive months. The weak data result is attributed to Boeing employee strikes. NFP Growth Falls, Lowest Since December 2020 The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recorded NFP at +12,000 in October 2024. This realization is much lower compared to the average NFP increase of +194,000 over the previous 12 months and the economist expectation of +113,000 based on a Reuters survey. This achievement also indicates the lowest growth since December 2020. The weak NFP growth in October 2024 was caused by a decrease in jobs in the manufacturing sector and professional and business services. The weak NFP data was also driven by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The Boeing strike also became a strong catalyst for the weakening of the existing data. This result caused the unemployment rate in October 2024 to be flat at 4.1% (vs September 2024: 4.1%). Furthermore, the BLS also revised down NFP growth in August to +78,000 (-51%) and September to +223,000 (-12%), both dropping by -112,000 from previous reports. NFP data is the last crucial data released before the US election officially begins. Nevertheless, surveys still show the incumbent, Harris, has an edge over Trump in the upcoming US election. According to the National Polling Average by The New York Times/Siena College (3/11), Harris still leads by 49% (vs. Trump: 48%). The sentiment for Harris's victory is also supported by five other surveys. Responding to this data, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates by -50 bps until the end of 2024 as of Monday (4/11) rose to 82% (vs. 28/10: 69%), based on the CME FedWatch Tool. The US Dollar Index (DXY) weakened by -0.47% to 103.8 and the 10-year Treasury yield fell by -9 bps to 4.29%. Key Takeaway The weak US economic data increased the probability of US interest rate cuts by -25bps in November and December, respectively. This is reflected in the rise in the probability of an interest rate cut over the past week by 4pp in November to 99.8% and 12pp in December to 81.5%. This US interest rate cut sentiment has the potential to create room for strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate and further monetary easing by BI. Based on Bloomberg consensus as of November 4, 2024, BI is expected to cut interest rates by a minimum of -25 bps until the end of 2024, the same as the expectation as of October 7. The Indonesian government's 10-year bond yield fell -3 bps WoW to 6.79% today (11/4). However, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar continued to weaken -0.18% WoW to 15,753.",
