      "title": "Temu Rumors and Unclear Government Stance on E-commerce Penetration",
      "content": "The BUKA stock itself has been actively traded in recent days and even increased by +25% on Monday (7/10) following rumors that Temu - an e-commerce platform from China - intends to enter Indonesia by acquiring BUKA. On the other hand, the government seems not to be in agreement in responding to the issue of Temu entering Indonesia. The Minister of Communication and Informatics, Budi Arie Setiadi, said that his side forbids Temu from operating in Indonesia to protect domestic MSMEs. Meanwhile, the Director General of Domestic Trade at the Ministry of Trade, Moga Simatupang, stated that the operation of Temu in Indonesia is unavoidable. Moga mentioned that Temu has the opportunity to operate in Indonesia as long as it meets the requirements of Minister of Trade Regulation No. 31/2023. BUKA will hold an EGM shortly, with one of the agendas being to discuss the resignation plan of the company's Director and President, Teddy Nuryanto Oetomo. Key Takeaway: We assess that the movement of BUKA stock price will be more influenced by the development of potential or proposed corporate actions, considering the company's performance and outlook are still not very good. In 2Q24, BUKA again recorded a negative adjusted EBITDA of minus 41 billion rupiah, after having recorded a positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time of 15 billion rupiah in 1Q24. This performance decline caused BUKA management to cancel the guidance set at the beginning of 2024, which targeted a minimum FY24 adjusted EBITDA of 200 billion rupiah. On Thursday (10/10), BUKA's stock price fell -7.19% to 129 rupiah per share.",

This step was taken because the China-based e-commerce platform is not registered as an electronic system operator in Indonesia. Budi stated that Temu's business model could destroy Indonesian MSMEs because the e-commerce platform sells goods directly from the factory to the consumer, thus potentially disrupting domestic products and labor. The Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, said that the iPhone 16 series cannot be officially sold in Indonesia because the validity period for Apple's Domestic Component Level (TKDN) certificate has expired. Agus mentioned that the process for extending the TKDN certificate is currently awaiting Apple to fulfill its investment commitment in Indonesia. Previously, Apple committed to investing 1.71 trillion rupiah in Indonesia, but the realization to date has only reached 1.48 trillion rupiah.",

The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said that his side will revoke the business licenses of oil and gas wells that are inactive or idle. Bahlil mentioned that as many as 5,000 out of 16,000 idle wells have significant reserve potential, with most concessions held by State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) and Pertamina.
