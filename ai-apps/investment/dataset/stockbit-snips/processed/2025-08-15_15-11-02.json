      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto provided a state speech regarding the targets and programs for 2026, coinciding with the release of the 2026 State Budget Draft Financial Notes [see table above]. There are 8 government priority programs in 2026, namely: 1) food security; 2) energy security; 3) Free Nutritious Meals (MBG); 4) education; 5) health; 6) village, cooperative, and MSME development; 7) defense; and 8) acceleration of investment and global trade. Here are some of our important notes:\n1. Food Security - The budget for this program increased by +32.6% YoY to IDR 164.6 trillion (vs. 2025 APBN: +8.8% YoY). Some uses of this budget include food distribution and reserves (IDR 29.9 trillion), production (IDR 114.1 trillion), and consumption (IDR 6.4 trillion).\n2. Education and MBG - The education budget is set at IDR 757.8 trillion (+4.8% YoY), which is stated to be the highest in Indonesian history. This budget includes the budget for the MBG program amounting to IDR 335 trillion (vs. 2025 APBN: IDR 171 trillion), in line with the proposal from the National Nutrition Agency. The MBG program in 2026 is targeted to reach 82.9 million beneficiaries, up from the current level of around 20 million recipients.\n3. Energy Security - The energy security budget is set at IDR 402.4 trillion, which will be allocated for energy subsidies, tax incentives, new and renewable energy (EBT) development, and village electricity supply. President Prabowo also reiterated his hope that 100% of electricity generation will come from EBT within the next 10 years, earlier than the global target of 2060.\n4. Village, Cooperative, and MSME Development - The total budget reaches IDR 181.8 trillion, where the Merah Putih Village Cooperative (Kopdes) program will receive IDR 83 trillion support from the state budget to be channeled through Himbara (State-Owned Banks).\n5. More Centralized State Expenditures - Out of the total state expenditure budget of IDR 3,787 trillion (+7.3% YoY), central government expenditures will increase by +17.8% YoY while the budget transfer to regions will decrease by -24.8% YoY.\n6. 3 Million Houses Program - Around 770,000 housing units will be supported by the state budget with a total budget of IDR 57.7 trillion, mainly through the Housing Financing Liquidity Facility (FLPP).",

      "content": "Overall, the priority programs mentioned are in line with developments reported since the new government took office, so there are no surprises. Regarding the budget posture itself, we assess the target for a tax revenue increase of +13% YoY in 2026 to be challenging. We also assess the announcement of the budget for Kopdes Merah Putih amounting to IDR 83 trillion slightly provides certainty for SOE bank stocks. For comparison, with a loan ceiling of up to 3 billion per cooperative, the number of Kopdes reaching ~80,000 would require total funding up to IDR 240 trillion.",

      "content": "The Constitutional Court on Thursday (14/8) rejected the request for a material test against Law No. 7/2021 concerning the harmonization of tax regulations. One of the lawsuits filed with the Constitutional Court was that the regulation did not provide a guarantee of legal certainty and a decent standard of living due to difficulties in fulfilling basic necessities. The Constitutional Court assessed that the range of VAT imposition rates of around 5-15% in the regulation is a flexible fiscal policy, allowing the government to adjust the rate based on national economic conditions and state fiscal needs while still considering the socio-economic conditions of the community. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court explained that the determination of the VAT rate within this range can only be determined by the government after being submitted to the DPR for discussion and agreement in the preparation of the State Budget Draft, thus still fulfilling the principle of 'no taxation without representation.'",
