      "content": "XL Axiata (EXCL) and Smartfren Telecom (FREN) announced a definitive merger agreement with a pre-synergy enterprise value of more than IDR 104 trillion (approximately US$6.5 billion). EXCL will be the surviving entity under the new name PT XLSmart Telecom Sejahtera Tbk. The agreed merger exchange ratio is 1 FREN share for 0.011 shares of the combined company (i.e., about 91 FREN shares for 1 EXCL share). One pre-merger EXCL share will retain one share of the combined company but with a 27.95% ownership dilution. For the minority shareholder of PT Smart Telecom, PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia, one minority share will receive 0.005 EXCL shares. Axiata and Sinarmas will each hold 34.8% of the combined EXCL, while the public will hold 30.4%. Sinarmas’s share will be sourced from PT Bali Media Telekomunikasi (24.6%), PT Global Nusa Data (4.7%), PT Wahana Inti Nusantara (2.9%) and PT Gerbangmas Tunggal Sejahtera (2.6%). To equalise ownership, Sinarmas, via PT Bali Media Telekomunikasi, will purchase roughly 2.4 billion EXCL shares from Axiata for a maximum cash consideration of US$475 million (≈IDR 7.5 trillion), implying a price of IDR 3,157 per share. The payment includes US$400 million (≈IDR 6.3 trillion, IDR 2,659 per share) at the initial transaction and an additional US$75 million (≈IDR 1.2 trillion) if the “Deferred Consideration” condition is met. A buy-back option is offered to any EXCL or FREN minority shareholders who do not agree with the merger, up to 10% of the pre-merger shares with a total allocation of up to IDR 3.09 trillion. The buy-back price is IDR 2,350 per EXCL share and IDR 25 per FREN share. If the required buy-back exceeds IDR 3.09 trillion, Axiata and Sinarmas will act as joint standby purchasers in equal portions. For FREN warrant series III (FREN-W2), FREN grants all FREN-W2 warrant holders the right to exercise their warrants within at least three months from 11 December 2024. Management said the merger could generate pre-tax synergies of US$300-400 million, equal to 21-30% of the pro-forma combined EBITDA for 3Q24 TTM. Synergies are expected mainly from (1) optimisation of overlapping network sites (14,000-20,000 sites, 20-30% of total sites) and (2) optimisation of sales channels, both marketing activation and digital channels. The combined blended ARPU is expected to fall slightly from IDR 41,000 due to FREN’s lower blended ARPU, and EBITDA margin will decline from 51.5% to 49.4%. Guidance on the combined performance will be provided later. The merger is targeted to close in 1H 2025, with the extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 21 March 2025.",
