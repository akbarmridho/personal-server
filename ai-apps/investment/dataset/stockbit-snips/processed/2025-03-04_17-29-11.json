      "title": "China Announces Retaliatory Tariffs, Trade War Continues",
      "content": "China today, Tuesday (4/3), announced additional retaliatory tariffs of approximately 10-15% for US imported products effective March 10, 2025, marking the country's second round of retaliation against the US following the 10% retaliatory tariff that took effect on February 10, 2025. This announcement followed the implementation of an additional 10% import tariff by the US on imports originating from China effective today, which brings the total import tariff on goods from China to 20%. In addition to China, the US also began imposing import tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico effective today, except for energy products from Canada which are only subject to a 10% tariff. In response to this, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately imposed 25% retaliatory tariffs on 30 billion Canadian dollars worth of US imports, and threatened to impose these tariffs on another 125 billion Canadian dollars worth of US imports if the US does not repeal the tariffs within 21 days. Previously, the imposition of import tariffs on Canada and Mexico was postponed for one month pending negotiations to strengthen border controls between the countries to meet US demands regarding overcoming the flow of narcotics into the US. However, Trump stated that narcotics from both neighboring countries were still entering at a very high and unacceptable level. The tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as the additional tariffs for China, are only part of Trump's protectionist policies, which plan a number of tariffs on specific or regional commodities. Previously, Trump planned to impose a 25% import tariff on iron and aluminum commodities effective March 12, 2025. He also proposed a 25% tariff on imports of cars, medicines, semiconductors, and wood. Besides specific commodities, Trump also threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs on countries that hinder US trade, and recently mentioned imposing a 25% tariff on imports of cars and everything else from the European Union. Amid these tariff plans, Bloomberg reported last week that the scope and deadlines for the tariff plans announced by Trump remain unclear. For example, it is still unknown whether tariffs on specific commodities will be included as part of regional tariffs or implemented separately. On Monday (3/3), the US Dollar Index (DXY) fell -0.81% to the level of 106.7 and all US stock market indices closed weaker, with the S&P 500 at -1.76%, Dow Jones Index at -1.48%, and Nasdaq at -2.2%. This weakening occurred before China announced additional retaliatory tariffs for the US. In Indonesia, the IHSG also closed weaker at -2.14% today, with the Indonesian government bond yield for the 10-year tenor flat at 6.85% (-2 bps) and the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar slightly strengthening by +0.21% to the level of 16,445.",

      "content": "The escalation of the trade war is once again increasing global economic uncertainty and the prospect of interest rate cuts. On one hand, additional tariffs from the US on other countries have the potential to drive up prices and inflation in the US. On the other hand, retaliatory tariffs against the US could weaken its exports and the economy. These two dynamics will be factors influencing the direction of interest rates by the Fed. As of today, analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool shows that the probability of a US interest rate cut of more than 50 bps during 2025 rose to 68% from 41% a week ago. Amid increasing uncertainty and its impact on Indonesian capital market volatility, investors can consider locking in yields on short-term FR bonds such as PBS003 (tenor ~2 years) which offers a yield of 6.37% per year today. On the other hand, investors with higher risk appetite can consider quality stocks that are currently correcting, such as Bank Central Asia ($BBCA).",

This step is part of the investment plan for the downstreaming program in the energy and mineral resources sector amounting to 618 billion US dollars until 2040. Some projects to be realized immediately include the construction of a dimethyl ether (DME) plant for coal gasification into LPG fuel, crude oil storage construction on Nipah Island, and the construction of an oil refinery with a capacity of approximately 500,000 barrels. Bahlil claimed that the government currently does not need foreign investors to carry out these projects, following the withdrawal of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. from the coal gasification project with Bukit Asam ($PTBA) in 2023.",
