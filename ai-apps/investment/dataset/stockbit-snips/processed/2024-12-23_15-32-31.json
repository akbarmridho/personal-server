      "title": "CPO Export Levy Rate to Increase to 10% Starting 2025",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that the government will raise the export levy rate for crude palm oil (CPO) from 7.5% to 10% starting January 2025. This increase is intended to support the B40 program or the use of 40% biofuel (BBN) for biodiesel, which is also planned to commence in early 2025. Meanwhile, the export levy rate for other processed palm oil products will be set at a minimum of 4.5% from the previous range of 3-6%.\nThis decision came only 3 months after the government lowered and simplified the CPO export levy tariff scheme from the progressive system to a single tariff of 7.5%.\n\nThe government targets biodiesel distribution to reach 15.6 million kiloliters (KL) in 2025, increasing from the 2024 target of 13.4 million KL along with the increase in BBN blending. According to the President Director of the Palm Oil Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS), Eddy Abdurrachman, the estimated funding requirement for biodiesel subsidies will reach 47 trillion rupiah in 2025. This estimation was conveyed in early November 2024 when the CPO price was around ~4,900 Malaysian Ringgit per ton.\nEddy revealed that the funds managed by BPDPKS are still adequate to support the B40 program next year if combined with projected revenue in 2025. Until the end of 2024, the balance of funds managed by BPDPKS is estimated to reach 31.8 trillion rupiah, while the projection for 2025 palm oil export levy revenue reaches 20.3 trillion rupiah with the existing tariff. Using the new tariff, palm oil export levies have the potential to reach 27.1 trillion rupiah.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe need for biodiesel subsidies will depend on how quickly the full implementation of the B40 program proceeds, as well as the movement of CPO and diesel prices. Higher export levy rates will increase certainty for the B40 program running in the coming years. However, with the current scheme, revenue run-rate, and expenditures, the biodiesel program has the potential to be unsustainable in the long term, especially if the government intends to increase blending to 50% or B50. On the other hand, the increase in the CPO export levy rate risks reducing the competitiveness of CPO compared to other vegetable oils, which could reduce demand.\n\nOn Monday's (23/12) trading, the CPO price strengthened +2.6% to the level of 4,548 Malaysian Ringgit per ton.",
