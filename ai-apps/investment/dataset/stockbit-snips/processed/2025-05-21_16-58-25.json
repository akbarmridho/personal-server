      "title": "BI Cuts Interest Rate, Downgrades Credit Growth & Economic Projections",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to cut the BI Rate by -25 bps to 5.5% today, Wednesday (21/5), with the deposit facility and lending facility also decreasing by -25 bps to levels of 4.75% and 6.25% respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations.\n\nBank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision is an effort to support domestic economic growth which is beginning to slow down. Bank Indonesia itself cut its economic growth target for 2025 from +4.7-5.5% to +4.6-5.4%, marking the second downgrade by the central bank this year. For context, the realization of Indonesian economic growth in 1Q25 reached only +4.87% YoY, lower than the government's target of +5.2% YoY and marking the weakest growth since 3Q21.\n\nBank Indonesia also cut the credit growth target from the range of +11-13% YoY to approximately +8-11% YoY. This step follows the slowdown in banking credit growth in 4M25, which only grew +8.88% YoY (vs. 1Q25: +9.16% YoY) due to weakening demand and tightening liquidity. Banking credit growth in 4M25 marks the weakest growth since 7M23.\n\nIn addition to cutting the interest rate, Bank Indonesia announced it will lower the macroprudential liquidity ratio for conventional and sharia banks, by -100 bps to levels of 4% and 2.5% respectively. The foreign funding ratio for banks will also be increased by +5 percentage points to a maximum of 35% of bank capital. Both of these policies will be implemented starting June 1, 2025.\n\nBank Indonesia expects The Fed to cut interest rates by -50 bps by the end of 2025 following a lower inflation outlook due to the de-escalation of the trade war. Bank Indonesia's expectation aligns with the consensus expectation, where analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool as of today expects a Fed interest rate cut of â‰¥50 bps by the end of 2025, with a probability reaching 72.1%.\n\nPerry affirmed that Indonesia's inflation outlook remains within the target range of 1.5-3.5% YoY. To maintain the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate, Bank Indonesia will continue interventions in the forex and bond markets, as well as optimization of instruments such as SRBI, SVBI, and SUVBI.\n\nFollowing today's BI Rate cut announcement, the IHSG closed up +0.67% and the Rupiah to USD exchange rate strengthened +0.12% to the level of 16,383, while the 10-year government bond yield fell -23 bps to the level of 6.828%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that Bank Indonesia has room to continue cutting interest rates following the strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate and the prospect of future US interest rate cuts. Current consensus expects Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by another -25 bps until the end of 2025, based on surveys from Bloomberg and Reuters.\n\nWe recommend that investors stay invested, especially in sectors sensitive to monetary policy easing, such as banking ($BBCA, $BBRI, $BMRI, $BBNI) and property ($SMRA, $CTRA, $PWON, $BSDE). Investors also need to watch the release of US Producer Price Index inflation data and the Fed meeting to get a clearer picture regarding the future prospect of Bank Indonesia's interest rate cuts.",
