      "title": "BI Rate Held at 4.75%, Outside Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (22/10) kept the BI Rate at 4.75%, contrary to the consensus expectation of a 25 basis point cut. The lending facility and deposit facility were also maintained at 5.5% and 3.75% respectively. Governor Perry Warjiyo said the central bank still sees room for further rate cuts, but the current focus is on maintaining the stability of the rupiah exchange rate and strengthening the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission that has been pursued previously. Perry urged banks to accelerate the reduction of loan interest rates. He noted that the BI Rate has fallen by 150 basis points since September 2024, but bank loan rates only fell by 15 basis points from 9.20% at the start of 2025 to 9.05% in September 2025. A similar situation occurred with the third-party deposit (DPK) rate, which only fell by 29 basis points from 4.81% to 4.52%, mainly because a special rate for large depositors still accounts for 26% of total bank DPK. To speed up monetary policy transmission, Bank Indonesia will expand macro-prudential liquidity incentive provisions from 1 December 2025, granting incentives to banks that lower their loan rates. The incentive can be up to 0.5% of DPK, depending on the elasticity of the bank's loan-rate reduction to the BI Rate cut. Meanwhile, the liquidity incentive linked to credit to priority sectors remains at 5% of DPK but will be applied on a forward-looking basis, based on future credit commitment, instead of the previous backward-looking approach. This change is expected to stimulate faster credit growth. The decision to keep rates unchanged comes as Indonesia's foreign-exchange reserves fell to USD 148.7 billion at the end of September 2025, marking a three-month consecutive decline and the lowest level in 14 months. The reserve drawdown could limit Bank Indonesia's ability to support rupiah stability. Key takeaway: besides focusing on monetary transmission, the rate hold was taken before the APEC Summit meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (31 Oct-1 Nov 2025), which could affect market volatility and outlook.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that Danantara is considering creating a national asset manager by merging asset-management units from Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), Bank Mandiri (BMRI), and Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI). The combined assets under management of the three banks' units total nearly USD 8 billion at the beginning of 2025. Bloomberg sources said Danantara aims to finalize the plan in Q1 2026, but discussions are ongoing and no final decision has been made. Representatives of Danantara, BBRI, BMRI, and BBNI have not commented. Bank Indonesia recorded that bank credit growth reached +7.7% YoY for 9M25 (vs. +7.56% YoY for 8M25 and +10.85% YoY for 9M24), lower than the 2025 target range of +8-11% YoY. Governor Perry Warjiyo explained that credit demand remains weak due to a \"wait and see\" attitude among businesses, internal financing by corporations, and relatively high loan rates. Undisbursed loan facilities remained high at 22.54% of total credit limits in September 2025 (vs. 22.71% in 8M25). Investment credit grew +15.18% YoY, consumption credit +7.42% YoY, and working-capital credit +3.37% YoY. UMKM and Sharia financing slowed to +0.23% YoY and +7.55% YoY respectively. Bank Indonesia expects credit growth to stay at the lower end of the 2025 target range and to pick up in 2026. Spot gold prices fell sharply by 6.3% to USD 4,082.03 per ounce on Tuesday (21/10), the biggest intraday drop since June 2013, before closing down 5.3% at USD 4,125.22. This was the largest daily percentage decline since August 2020, driven by profit-taking as investors feared the recent gold rally was overvalued. On Wednesday (22/10) gold fell another 1.6% to around USD 4,058 per ounce. Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) recorded gas sales of 833 BBTU for 9M25, down 2% YoY and 4-13% below the 2025 target range of 873-958 BBTU. Gas transmission volume reached 1,622 MMSCFD (+6% YoY), exceeding the 2025 target of 1,435 MMSCFD. Upstream gas sales were 16,892 BOEPD, down 16% YoY and 2% below the 2025 target of 17,227 BOEPD. Pakuwon Jati (PWON) lowered its 2025 marketing-sales target from IDR 1.8 trillion to IDR 1.35 trillion. For 9M25, PWON posted marketing sales of about IDR 903 billion, a 20% YoY decline. ADHI's corporate secretary Rozi Sparta said the company recorded new contracts worth IDR 6.5 trillion in 9M25, down 54% YoY, representing 23-26% of the 2025 target range of IDR 25-28 trillion. The new contracts came from building projects (52%), natural resources (17%), transportation infrastructure (11%), and other sectors.",
