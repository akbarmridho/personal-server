      "title": "BYD Officially Enters Indonesia Next Week",
      "content": "Build Your Dream (BYD), the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, announced that it will launch its products in Indonesia on 18 January 2024. CNN Indonesia reported that BYD will release three electric car models in Indonesia: Dolphin, Atto 3, and Seal. Head of Marketing PT BYD Motor Indonesia, Luther Panjaitan, told Tempo that the Seal and Atto 3 models have already arrived in Indonesia. He also said that both models are ready to be marketed in Indonesia in the first half of 2024, although pricing details have not been announced. Before entering Indonesia, the Dolphin, Seal, and Atto 3 models were already sold in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. Price ranges: Thailand (assuming 1 baht = 444 rupiah): Dolphin 311-382 million rupiah; Atto 3 488-533 million rupiah; Seal 578-711 million rupiah. Malaysia (assuming 1 ringgit = 3.344 rupiah): Dolphin 335-420 million rupiah; Atto 3 501-561 million rupiah. The BYD launch announcement comes less than a month after the issuance of Presidential Regulation No. 79 of 2023, which details incentives for imported CBU electric cars, including import duty exemption and VAT/PPnBM exemption. Previously, since 2018 BYD has been a supplier for Transjakarta electric buses and Blue Bird electric taxis (BIRD). Key Takeaway: Assuming Indonesian selling prices are similar to those in Thailand and Malaysia, BYD products could be more attractive to Indonesian electric car consumers because they offer higher value-for-money. In terms of pricing, BYD products would be positioned between the Wuling Air EV (250-300 million rupiah) and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 (750-900 million rupiah). In November 2023, Wuling EV and Hyundai Ioniq accounted for 40.7% and 37.9% of total electric vehicle sales respectively. Moreover, the presence of well-priced products could accelerate electric vehicle penetration in Indonesia. In November 2023, electric vehicle sales reached 2.25% of total car sales, up from 0.32% in January 2023.",
