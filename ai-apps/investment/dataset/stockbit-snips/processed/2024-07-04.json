      "title": "Minor Evaluation of IHSG, BBRI Weight Increases 2.25 Percentage Points",
      "content": "BEI on 24 June 2024 announced the results of a minor evaluation of the IHSG index for the effective period 1 July-30 September 2024. The evaluation includes changes in the weight of several stocks in the index, with Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) experiencing the most significant weight increase of 2.25 percentage points, rising from 6.75% to 9%. To determine a stock's weight in the IHSG, BEI uses a free-float adjusted index and applies a maximum cap of 9%. In the previous evaluation in March 2024, BBRI had a weight of 9%. However, a decline in BBRI's share price over the last three months caused its weight to fall to 6.75% before the June 2024 evaluation. The increase in BBRI's weight in the June 2024 evaluation was driven by a higher maximum amount of free-float shares calculated by BEI for weighting. Previously, the free-float shares of BBRI used in the March 2024 evaluation were 43.4 billion shares, which corresponded to the 9% weight cap at that time. In the June 2024 evaluation, the free-float shares of BBRI rose to 60 billion shares, reaching the maximum weight of 9%. Although the calculated free-float shares increased, BBRI still has uncounted free-float shares because the free-float shares of BBRI as of May 2024 reached 70.1 billion shares. After BBRI, the other issuers with the largest weight increases were TPIA (+0.12 percentage point) and MDKA (+0.08 percentage point). The largest weight decreases were recorded by AMRT (-0.27 percentage point), BMRI (-0.24 percentage point), and AMMN (-0.16 percentage point). The next evaluation of the IHSG index will be carried out in September 2024, with the effective period 1 October-31 December 2024. Key Takeaway: This weighting can affect investors, especially institutional investors who use the IHSG as a benchmark or passive institutional investors tracking the index. Since the announcement of the new index weighting on 24 June 2024, BBRI's share price has risen about +11% as of 4 July 2024. Additionally, foreign investors recorded a net buy of IDR 550 billion in BBRI shares on 28 June, one day before the effective period of the evaluation. It is important to note that there are still free-float shares of BBRI that have not been counted for IHSG weighting. Consequently, if BBRI's weight drops in the future due to a price decline, the BBRI weight could rise again.",
