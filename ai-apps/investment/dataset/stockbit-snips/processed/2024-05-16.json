      "title": "US Inflation Cools to 3.4% YoY, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "U.S. inflation slowed to an annual rate of 3.4% year-over-year (YoY) in April 2024 (versus March 2024: 3.5% YoY), in line with consensus expectations and ending a three-month streak of readings above expectations. On a month-over-month basis, inflation eased to 0.3% MoM (versus March 2024: 0.4% MoM), lower than the consensus forecast of 0.4% MoM.\n\nCore inflation also eased to 0.3% MoM and 3.6% YoY in April 2024 (versus March 2024: 0.4% MoM and 3.8% YoY), matching expectations and marking the lowest annual core inflation in three years.\n\nNevertheless, the annual inflation rate remains above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% YoY.\n\nThe three major U.S. equity indices rose to fresh highs after the inflation release on Wednesday (15 May) local time, with the Nasdaq up 1.4%, the S&P 500 up 1.17% and the DJIA up 0.88%. On the same day, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 10 basis points to 4.34%.\n\nIndonesia’s capital market was also positively affected, with the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) gaining 0.93%, the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield falling 5 basis points to 6.93%, and the rupiah strengthening 0.8% to IDR 15,944 per U.S. dollar.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe easing of inflation and its alignment with expectations reinforces the narrative of a Federal Reserve rate-cut cycle. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market’s consensus now expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September 2024, with the probability rising from 69.6% on 6 May 2024 to 89.84% on Thursday (16 May).\n\nA potential Fed rate cut and a faster-than-expected Bank Indonesia easing could boost sentiment for the banking, property and technology sectors. Several issuers in those sectors posted strong gains on the day, including $BBNI +3.48%, $SMRA +7.48% and $BUKA +2.42%.",
