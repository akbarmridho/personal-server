      "content": "Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara has appointed four banks – DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis SA, and Standard Chartered Plc – as coordinators to obtain a multi-currency loan facility of up to US$10 billion. The facility could become the largest loan in Southeast Asian history, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg previously reported that Danantara is targeting a loan tenor of three to five years for general corporate purposes. The loan is unsecured, without any guarantee, and without any government support letters. Danantara CEO Rosan Roeslani said the company is expected to manage dividends of IDR 150 trillion in 2025, equivalent to US$9.2 billion at an exchange rate of 16,220. From the expenditure side, Danantara plans to disburse an investment of US$5 billion (approximately IDR 81 trillion) by the end of 2025, according to Managing Director Finance Danantara, Arief Budiman. In June-July 2025, Danantara signed several cooperation agreements (see table). In addition, Danantara is reported to be exploring potential collaborations with various parties, including: 1) Geothermal development with PGEO – Danantara is reported to cooperate with Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGEO) on a 3 GW geothermal project, although the investment amount is not disclosed. 2) Involvement in a critical minerals project with the United States – the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said Danantara will be involved in a critical minerals project offered by Indonesia to the United States. 3) Rumor of a minority stake acquisition in GOTO – Bloomberg reported that Danantara is discussing with GoTo Gojek Tokopedia (GOTO) to acquire a minority stake in the merged entity of Grab and GoTo. The merger between Grab and GoTo is said to face regulatory hurdles.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway on Danantara Loan",
      "content": "Credit analysts from ANZ, Viacheslav Shilin and Ting Meng, told Bloomberg that the large loan size with a short tenor could create payment pressure for Danantara. This situation may increase Danantara's reliance on dividend receipts from quasi-sovereign entities such as state-owned enterprises and on repeated refinancing, which could dampen investor sentiment toward Indonesian state-owned enterprise credit. We assess that other loan details – such as the interest rate – could indicate investor confidence in Danantara. For comparison, PT Pertamina Hulu Energi issued a global bond in May 2025 worth US$1 billion with a five-year tenor and a 5.25 % coupon. Additionally, Bank Mandiri (BMRI) issued a global bond in March 2025 worth US$800 million with a three-year tenor and a 4.9 % coupon.",

      "content": "1. U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will start imposing a 50 % tariff on copper imports beginning 1 August 2025. This is the latest step in Trump's tariff series aimed at boosting domestic mining and metal processing. Trump previously raised tariffs on steel and aluminium and hinted at sectoral tariffs on other commodities. The tariff adds to country-by-country tariffs currently being negotiated by the United States with its trading partners, also effective 1 August 2025. 2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto claimed on Thursday (10 July) that Indonesia's meeting with the United States on tariffs was \"positive,\" with both countries exploring a broader partnership in critical minerals. Airlangga met with U.S. Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington on Wednesday (9 July). The ministry said the talks covered tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and commercial partnerships, and that discussions will intensify over the next three weeks. 3. President Prabowo Subianto said Indonesia aims to achieve 100 % renewable energy by 2035, much faster than previously announced. As of May 2025, the renewable energy mix had reached 13.21 %. Earlier, the government had formalised a power procurement plan for 2025-2034 adding 69.5 GW of capacity, of which 42.6 GW (61 %) is renewable, 10.3 GW (15 %) is storage, and 16.6 GW (24 %) is fossil fuel. 4. China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that China's consumer price index (CPI) in June 2025 rose 0.1 % year-on-year, reversing three months of 0.1 % year-on-year deflation and exceeding consensus expectations of a flat reading. The annual CPI marked the first rise since January 2025, driven by e-commerce shopping events, increased consumer subsidies, and de-escalation of trade tensions with the United States. However, month-on-month CPI showed a 0.1 % deflation (May 2025: 0.2 % deflation). Core inflation rose to 0.7 % year-on-year (May 2025: 0.6 % year-on-year), the highest in 14 months. 5. Prima Multi Usaha Indonesia (PMUI) listed on the IDX on Thursday (10 July) at a price of IDR 180 per share and closed down 15 %, hitting the lower auto-reject band at IDR 153. Investor Daily reported that PMUI did not experience oversubscription during the offering, with total participation of about 46 thousand investors.",
