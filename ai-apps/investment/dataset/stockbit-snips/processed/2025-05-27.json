      "content": "Bloomberg reported that a group of Indonesian thermal coal exporters are demanding a replacement of the local Coalindo index in the calculation of the Indonesia Coal Index (ICI). They claim the index pushes Indonesian coal prices higher than other reference prices. The Coalindo index accounts for half of the ICI weighting, while the remaining price assessment comes from Argus Media Ltd. in the United Kingdom. Traders told Bloomberg that the ICI price with a GAR of 3,800 is about 5% higher than the reference price provided by Argus on 16 May 2025. This indicates that part of the ICI price is being driven up by a higher assessment from Coalindo, a distortion that has been widening since February 2025.",

Bank-only net profit fell 10% year-on-year (YoY) and 12% month-on-month (MoM). Over the first four months of 2025 (4M25) the bank-only net profit was essentially flat, up 1% YoY. Net interest margin (NIM) fell to 4.26% versus 4.64% in 4M24. Net interest income grew 6% YoY, but higher interest expense outweighed the increase, pulling NIM down. Loan growth slowed to 15% YoY in April 2025, down from about 19% YoY earlier in the year and moving toward the management’s 2025 guidance of 10-12% YoY. Deposit growth was strong (+23% YoY) while CASA grew 12% YoY, supporting the loan-to-deposit ratio. Provision expense fell 9% YoY, keeping cost-of-credit (CoC) below 1% for the period. Pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) was flat, with a 1% YoY decline because a 15% YoY rise in non-interest income was offset by a 26% YoY rise in operating expenses. The bank’s performance was roughly in line with the consensus expectation of a 1.5% YoY increase in consolidated net profit for 2025, but below the consensus for BBNI.",
