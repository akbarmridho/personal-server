      "title": "BBCA outperforms consensus with 16% YoY Net Profit Growth for Bank Only in 5M25",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded net profit for the bank only of 5 trillion Rupiah in May 2025 (+12% YoY, +10% MoM). This result brought the bank only's net profit for 5M25 to 25.2 trillion Rupiah (+16% YoY). Excluding dividend income, net profit for 5M25 grew +10% YoY, relatively higher compared to the 2025F consolidated net profit estimate from consensus at +6.6% YoY.Net Profit Supported by Income Growth and Efficient Opex. Net Interest Income (NII) and Non-Interest Income (Non-II) - excluding dividend income - grew relatively solidly by +7% YoY during 5M25. Meanwhile, opex growth was kept efficient at +4% YoY during 5M25. This dynamic resulted in Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) - excluding dividend income - growing +8% during 5M25.For information, including dividends, Non-II grew +22% YoY during 5M25. Although dividends from subsidiaries are recorded as Non-II in the bank-only financial statements, this income will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.NIM and CoC Recovered in May 2025; Liquidity Quite Good. On a monthly basis, both Net Interest Margin (NIM) and credit cost (CoC) improved post-Lebaran in April 2025. NIM was recorded at 5.86% in May 2025 (vs. April 2025: 5.56%), while CoC was at 0.18% in May 2025 (vs. April 2025: 0.59%). This result brought the realization of NIM during 5M25 to 5.73%, in line with management's 2025 guidance in the range of 5.7-5.8%. The realized CoC itself stood at 0.37% during 5M25, still higher than management's 2025 guidance of 0.3%.BBCA's liquidity is relatively good with a Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) at 80% and the CASA Ratio increasing again to 83.2% as of May 2025 along with Current Account growth (+12% YoY, +4% MoM). BBCA's sufficiently good liquidity condition supports credit growth which is still quite strong at +12% YoY as of May 2025.Key Takeaway: We assessed BBCA's bank-only performance during 5M25 as quite positive. NIM is in line with guidance, while credit cost (CoC) is still higher than guidance but improved in May 2025. Loan growth as of May 2025 is also still recorded fast, albeit with a slowing trend in line with management targets. We also highlight interest income which rose to 8 trillion Rupiah in May 2025 (+9% YoY, +4% MoM). This interest income growth may indicate a beginning rise in lending yield, in line with management's intention.",

Herwin also added that the company wants to accelerate reaching a surplus on return on risk in 2028 or in the next 5-6 years, so that dividend distribution can be implemented in the next 5 years.

This mine is estimated to have a gold grade of 3.5-4.9 grams per ton, higher than the grade from the open-pit mine which is only around 1-1.5 grams per ton.
