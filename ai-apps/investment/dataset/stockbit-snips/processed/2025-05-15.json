      "content": "Gaikindo reported that national car wholesales in April 2025 reached 51,205 units (+5% YoY, -28% MoM). This result makes the cumulative wholesales sales for the first four months of 2025 (4M25) total 256,368 units (-3% YoY), which is roughly in line with expectations because it represents 28-34% of Gaikindo's 2025 target of 750,000-900,000 units (versus 4M24: 30% of the 2024 realization). The overall market also saw a solid growth in hybrid vehicle (HEV) sales, supporting Toyota sales. However, a significant increase in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales caused the BEV segment to surpass HEV sales in 1Q25. The rapid growth of BEV sales is also reflected in BYD + Denza and Chery sales. As of April 2025, the market shares of BYD + Denza and Chery have risen to 8.4% and 3.2% respectively, up from around 2% recorded by both in December 2024. BYD's market share has made it the fourth largest brand in Indonesia in April 2025, even though it entered the Indonesian market only in mid-2024. The yearly comparison for April 2025 is also affected by the Lebaran seasonality effect. If only March and April 2025 sales are considered, total national car wholesales for those two months fell slightly by 1% YoY to 122,100 units. Although still declining, the weak sales condition is considered expected by the market.",
