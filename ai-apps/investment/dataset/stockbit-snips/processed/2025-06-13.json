      "content": "Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced that the Israeli military launched an attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military sites, and ballistic missiles. The operation was carried out as a step to prevent Iran from further developing nuclear weapons. The attack killed the highest commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, as well as the chief of staff and senior nuclear scientists. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran will retaliate. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that the US was not involved, although the US had known the attack would happen. Iran is the third largest producer in OPEC+ with production about 3.3 million barrels per day, about 3% of global production, and sells almost all to China. According to New York Times, China has large strategic oil reserves from over a decade of purchases, which can help China survive several weeks of global oil supply disruption. Bloomberg reported that the escalation also raises concerns about Iran potentially blockading the Strait of Hormuz, which carries about 26% of total global oil trade. The strait is also important for LNG, with more than one fifth of global LNG supply passing through. Following the Israeli attack, Brent crude futures for August 2025 rose up to +13.17% to $78.5 per barrel on Friday (13/6), before easing to +8.29% later that day. On the same day, spot gold rose up to +1.88% before easing to +1.15% at $3,442 per troy ounce. Stock markets reacted negatively on Friday (13/6), with Nikkei (-0.92%), Hang Seng (-0.59%), and Indonesia's IHSG (-0.53%) closing weaker, while S&P 500 Futures fell -0.94%. Key Takeaway: Following the commodity price rise, shares of oil and gold producers strengthened on Friday (13/6), such as $MEDC (+9.38%), $ENRG (+7.03%), $RATU (+7.39%), $ANTM (+4.10%), $PSAB (+7.00%), and $ARCI (+23.21%). However, the commodity price increase may be accompanied by higher volatility, so the conflict development should be closely monitored by investors.",

      "content": "1. Bank Indonesia estimates retail sales in May 2025 will grow +2.6% YoY, although still contracting -0.6% MoM. In April 2025, retail sales recorded a contraction of -0.3% YoY and -5.1% MoM (vs March 2025: +5.5% YoY, +13.6% MoM), better than BI's forecast of -2.2% YoY and -6.9% MoM. The April decline was caused by normalization of demand after Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr.\n2. President Prabowo Subianto openly invited foreign investors to co-finance an $80 billion seawall project to prevent flooding on the northern coast of Java. He said investors from China and Japan have been invited, without further details. The project is expected to last 20 years, with the seawall stretching about 700 km from Banten to East Java.\n3. President Prabowo on Thursday (12/6) said he has no intention to reshuffle the cabinet soon because he is satisfied with his ministers. Earlier rumors of a reshuffle arose amid intensified meetings with PDI-P leader Megawati and public scrutiny of some ministers.\n4. Indonesia and Singapore on Friday (13/6) signed a memorandum of understanding to develop low-carbon electricity trade and collaborate on a carbon capture and storage project. The MoU will set policies, regulatory frameworks, and business arrangements to allow Indonesian electricity to be supplied to Singapore. They will also consider a legally binding agreement for cross-border CCS, which would be the first in Asia. Both countries also signed an agreement to develop a sustainable industrial zone on several Indonesian islands near Singapore, including Batam, Bintan, and Karimun.\n5. Minister of Religious Affairs Nasaruddin Umar said on Friday (13/6) that there is no official discussion from Saudi authorities regarding a possible 50% reduction of the Hajj quota in 2026. Earlier, the head of the Hajj Agency, Mochamad Irfan Yusuf, said on Tuesday (10/6) that Saudi authorities were considering cutting the 2026 Hajj quota by 50%.",
