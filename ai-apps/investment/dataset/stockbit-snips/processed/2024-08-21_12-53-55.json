      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, Prediction of 50 Bps FFR Cut in 2024",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (8/21) decided to maintain the reference interest rate at the BI Rate level of 6.25%, with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5.5% and 7% respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision is in line with the strategy of further strengthening the stabilization of the Rupiah exchange rate in Q3 2024. Perry also mentioned that the central bank still sees the opportunity for a BI Rate cut in Q4 2024. Perry said that Bank Indonesia projects the US central bank, the Fed, will conduct 2 cuts to the US interest rate (Fed Fund Rate/FFR) totaling -50 bps until the end of 2024. For comparison, the economist consensus compiled by Bloomberg expects the Fed to cut rates by -75 bps until the end of 2024. In line with increasing expectations for a Fed rate cut, the bond and stock markets in Indonesia experienced inflows of IDR 23.7 trillion and IDR 6.6 trillion respectively since the beginning of August 2024. The re-entry of foreign funds into the Indonesian capital market has also pushed up the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar by +4.8% Month to Date (MTD) to the level of 15,485 per August 21, 2024. Key Takeaway: The significant strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar recently is increasingly loosening the room for Bank Indonesia to start cutting interest rates, although it seems it will still wait for the Fed's rate cut first. As previously written in Stockbit Commentary, the prospect of interest rate cuts and the strengthening of the Rupiah exchange rate will provide a positive sentiment for the property and consumer sectors. Several property and consumer stocks have strengthened significantly in the last 1 month, including PWON (+11.9%), SMRA (+14.29%), ICBP (+6.02%), and INDF (+9.05%).",
