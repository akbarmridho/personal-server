      "title": "BI Rate Held at 4.75% Level, Against Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (10/22) maintained the BI Rate at 4.75%, contrary to consensus expectations which predicted a cut of -25 bps. The lending facility and deposit facility were also maintained at 5.5% and 3.75% respectively. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that they still see room for further interest rate cuts, but Bank Indonesia's current focus is on maintaining the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate and strengthening the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission already undertaken. Perry urged banks to accelerate the reduction of lending rates. Perry mentioned that the BI Rate has decreased by -150 bps since September 2024, but bank lending rates have only dropped -15 bps from 9.20% at the beginning of 2025 to 9.05% in September 2025. A similar trend occurred with third-party fund (TPF) rates, which only fell -29 bps from 4.81% to 4.52%, mainly due to the still high issuance of special rates to large depositors, reaching 26% of total banking TPF. To accelerate monetary policy transmission, Bank Indonesia will expand the provisions for macroprudential liquidity incentives starting from December 1, 2025, by providing incentives for banks that reduce their lending rates. The incentive provided will be a maximum of 0.5% of TPF, dependent on the elasticity of the related bank's lending rate reduction relative to the cut in the BI Rate. Meanwhile, liquidity incentives related to providing credit to priority sectors remain at 5% of TPF, but will be implemented on a forward-looking basis (unlike the previous backward-looking approach), based on future credit disbursement commitments. This change is expected to drive faster credit growth. Bank Indonesia's decision to maintain the interest rate occurred amidst the shrinkage of Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves to the level of 148.7 billion US dollars as of the end of September 2025, marking the third consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level in the last 14 months. The decrease in foreign exchange reserves potentially limits Bank Indonesia's room to support the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate. Key Takeaway: Besides focusing on the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the decision to maintain the BI Rate was also made ahead of the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, scheduled to take place at the APEC Summit on October 31-November 1, 2025, the developments of which may affect market volatility and outlook.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia recorded that banking credit growth reached +7.7% YoY as of 9M25 (vs. 8M25: +7.56% YoY, 9M24: +10.85% YoY), lower than the 2025 target which was downgraded by Bank Indonesia to the range of +8-11% YoY. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, explained that credit demand is still not strong, coinciding with the wait and see attitude from business actors, optimization of internal financing by corporations, and relatively high lending rates. This is reflected in the undisbursed loan value in September 2025 which is still quite large at 22.54% of the total available credit ceiling (vs. 8M25: 22.71%). Based on usage, investment credit grew by +15.18% YoY during 9M25 (vs. 8M25: +13.86% YoY), while consumption credit was +7.42% YoY (vs. 8M25: +7.89% YoY) and working capital +3.37% YoY (vs. 8M25: +3.53% YoY). Meanwhile, MSME credit and Sharia financing growth slowed down to +0.23% YoY and +7.55% YoY respectively. Bank Indonesia estimates that credit growth in 2025 will be at the lower bound of the 2025 target range and will increase in 2026.",
