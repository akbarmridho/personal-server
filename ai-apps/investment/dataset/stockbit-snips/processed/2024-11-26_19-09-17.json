      "content": "We tend to assess this divestment as positive. From a valuation perspective, the divestment value reflects a fairly premium valuation with a P/BV of 3.2x, significantly above the P/BV valuation of Campina Ice Cream (CAMP) at 1.75x. In terms of P/E, the divestment valuation based on our estimates is around 22-35x, which is above UNVR's overall valuation (15x FY23 P/E and 18.2x annualized 9M24 P/E). The P/E calculation is shown in the table below. \n.png)\nFrom another positive aspect, this divestment can make UNVR more focused on running its business and potentially create room for efficiency, especially considering the company's recent poor performance trend. UNVR may also provide a special dividend from the profit (~4.8 trillion rupiah before tax) from the sale of this business to investors. From a negative aspect, UNVR risks losing a business segment that offers good growth potential going forward. However, we cannot comment further on this due to limited information regarding the track record of the company's ice cream business performance.",

      "content": "Unilever Indonesia (UNVR) announced that it signed an agreement to sell its ice cream business on November 22, 2024, to PT Magnum Ice Cream Indonesia for a value of 7 trillion rupiah (excluding VAT). The transaction value includes: The fair market value of fixed assets totaling 2.55 trillion rupiah. The net book value as of September 2024 totaling 1.99 trillion rupiah. The inventory value as of September 2024 totaling 172.8 billion rupiah. On the agreement signing date, the buyer had an affiliation relationship with the company because the ultimate parent company for both was Unilever plc. However, at the time of execution and settlement of the transaction, the buyer no longer has an affiliation relationship with the company. According to UNVR, this divestment of the ice cream business is part of the Unilever group's plan to separate its global ice cream business. The sale allows UNVR to realize the value of its investment in the Indonesian ice cream business and return that value to its shareholders in the short term, as well as refocus on its remaining core businesses to enhance shareholder value in the long term. This sale agreement is the realization of the plan that UNVR management hinted at mid-year. This transaction plan will be discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) and the Independent GMS, although the dates have not yet been announced. Further details regarding the transaction will be outlined concurrently with the announcement of the GMS and Independent GMS.",
