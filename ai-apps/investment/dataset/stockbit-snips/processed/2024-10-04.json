      "title": "Oil Prices Jump After Biden Mentions Israel May Attack Iran",
      "content": "Oil prices on the futures market surged +5.03% to $77.62 per barrel on Thursday night (3 Oct) after U.S. President Joe Biden said the United States and Israel were discussing the possibility of attacking Iranian oil facilities. The rally continued on Friday (4 Oct), with Brent futures up +1.12% to $78.5 per barrel. The BBC reported that Biden made the comment as he left the White House and that his remarks did not clearly convey the U.S. government’s stance. Biden had previously said he would not support an Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The statement came a day after an anonymous Israeli official told Axios that Israel would launch a retaliatory strike, likely targeting Iranian oil production facilities and other strategic sites. Earlier, Iran launched its largest attack on Israel on Tuesday (1 Oct) in retaliation for Israel’s strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon the previous weekend. Iran, the OPEC’s third-largest producer, produced 3.7 million barrels per day in August 2024, about 4 % of global output. The short-term price outlook depends on geopolitical developments, according to SEB’s commodity analyst Bjarne Schieldrop, who said oil could spike to $200 per barrel if all Iranian oil infrastructure were destroyed. Oil-related and support-sector stocks rose on Friday (4 Oct): $MEDC +3.65%, $ENRG +6.19%, $ELSA +3.24%, $LEAD +4.0%, and $WINS +1.67%, driven by the oil price rally. The article was first released in Stockbit Commentary.",
