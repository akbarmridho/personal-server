      "title": "BUMI Plans to Write Off US$2.35 Billion Retained Earnings Deficit",
      "content": "Bumi Resources (BUMI) on Tuesday (23/4) announced a plan to conduct a quasi reorganization using the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. This plan will be discussed at the EGMS on May 30, 2024. A quasi reorganization itself is an accounting procedure to restructure equity by eliminating the negative retained earnings balance. Through this corporate action, BUMI will eliminate its retained earnings deficit which reached 2.35 billion US dollars as of 2023. In return, BUMI's paid-in capital top-up of 2.05 billion US dollars will decrease to minus 298.69 million US dollars. The net equity of BUMI will not change. BUMI management explained in the information disclosure that there are several benefits from the quasi reorganization, including: - Providing a true picture of the company's financial condition without being burdened by past deficits. - With no deficit balance, the company can distribute dividends. - Without the burden of past deficits, the company is expected to find it easier to obtain funding for business development. BUMI last distributed dividends in 2012. Based on Law Number 40 of 2007, dividends can only be distributed if the company's retained earnings balance is positive. Besides BUMI, several issuers have previously conducted a quasi reorganization, such as Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) in 2013 and Solusi Bangun Indonesia (SMCB) in 2010. Key Takeaway: The potential for the company to resume dividend payments can increase BUMI's attractiveness in the eyes of investors, although its dividend paying capacity is not as large as other coal producers such as ADRO, ITMG, and PTBA which have stronger financial positions (net cash position). Based on its financial position and 2023 performance, BUMI has the ability to pay dividends. As of December 2023, BUMI had cash of 76.8 million US dollars, debt of 306.6 million US dollars, and equity of 2.77 billion US dollars, resulting in a Net Debt to Equity Ratio at the level of 0.08x. Operationally, BUMI booked operating profit of 56.8 million US dollars with interest expense of 22.5 million US dollars, resulting in a net profit of 10.9 million US dollars. On Tuesday (23/4), the market responded positively to this quasi reorganization plan, with BUMI's stock price rising +21.18% to 103 rupiah per share.",
