      "title": "Still Challenging, Cement Sales Continue to Decline",
      "content": "Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa's ($INTP) management noted that the national cement industry sales volume declined by -7.3% YoY in June 2025, resulting in sales volume during 1H25 falling by -3.1% YoY (vs. 1H24: +2.2% YoY). This realization marks a decline in cement sales volume for the first half period for three consecutive years, if Grobogan Cement is excluded from the 2024 calculation (1H24 realization without Grobogan Cement: -0.9% YoY).Segment-wise, the industry's bulk cement sales volume dropped by -10% YoY and its contribution to total sales decreased to 28% (vs. 1H24: 30.2%). This decline occurred in line with falling demand from IKN, with sales volume in Kalimantan contracting by -20% YoY during 1H25 (vs. 1H24: +22% YoY).On the other hand, the bag cement sales volume was flat year-on-year during 1H25, with sales contribution increasing to 72% (vs. 1H24: 69.8%). INTP management explained that the company's bag cement selling prices remained stable as of June 2025, while several competitors started offering discounts or promotions in areas experiencing contraction.The industry-wide sales volume decline is reflected in the performance of INTP and Semen Indonesia ($SMGR) as the two main players in the cement industry. INTP recorded a cement sales volume decrease of -2.8% YoY during 1H25 (vs. 1H24 including Grobogan Cement: +10% YoY), while SMGR recorded -2.2% YoY (vs. 1H24: -1.1% YoY).The combined market share of INTP and SMGR also fell to 77.1% during 1H25 (vs. 1H24: 79.4%, 1Q25: 77.2%), lower than the level of ~79% in the 2023-2024 period. This weakening was mainly due to SMGR's market share being eroded to 47.6% during 1H25 (vs. 1H24: 50%, 1Q25: 47.1%), due to SMGR's domestic sales declining deeper than the industry average. Conversely, INTP's market share during 1H25 slightly increased to 29.5% from last year's position (vs. 1H24: 29.4%, 1Q25: 30.1%).",

      "content": "INTP Management in March 2025 estimated industry sales volume growth of around +1-2% YoY for 2025 (vs. 2024 realization: -0.35% YoY). Historically, sales volume in the second semester tends to be higher than the first semester, supported by accelerated government spending and fewer holidays. However, the weak sales realization in 1H25 requires sales in 2H25 to increase by at least around +4-6% YoY for the 2025 estimate to be achieved. Heavy rainfall, reduced incentives in the property sector, and weak public demand will be heavy challenges that need close monitoring.",

      "content": "1. Katadata reported that the Ministry of Communication and Digital is studying a proposal to restrict basic voice over internet protocol (VoIP) services, which if enforced would require users to purchase special internet services to access video call features like WhatsApp Call, Zoom, and Google Meet. The Director at the Ministry of Communication and Digital, Denny Setiawan, stated that this proposal is still in the initial discussion phase and aims to encourage contributions from over-the-top services regarding bandwidth capacity investment. Denny added that if restricting basic VoIP services is not feasible, the government will implement quality of service obligations for over-the-top services for bandwidth efficiency.\n2. A Chinese government spokesperson said that China and the US have further confirmed the details of the trade framework discussed by both parties in London in June 2025. The spokesperson added that the Chinese side will review and approve applications related to the export of controlled goods, while the US side will cancel a series of restrictive measures previously imposed on China. The statement from the Chinese government spokesperson came after the US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, told Bloomberg on Thursday (17/7) that the US and China had signed an agreement 2 days ago, which includes a commitment from China to supply rare earth to the US.\n3. The US Census Bureau recorded that US retail sales grew by +0.6% MoM in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: -0.9% MoM), exceeding consensus expectations at +0.1% MoM and ending the contraction trend of the previous 2 months. Meanwhile, core retail sales - used in GDP calculation - grew by +0.5% MoM (vs. May 2025: +0.2% MoM), exceeding consensus expectations at +0.3% MoM. Annually, US retail sales grew by +3.9% YoY (vs. May 2025: +3.3% YoY).\n4. The Minister of Cooperatives and SMEs, Maman Abdurrahman, stated on Friday (18/7) that the government plans to re-implement a policy of write-off for non-performing loans for SMEs, targeting approximately 900,000 beneficiaries. This policy is part of the government's efforts to enhance SME competitiveness. Previously, the government had issued Government Regulation No. 47/2024 on November 5, 2024, regarding the write-off policy for non-performing SME loans, which was valid until May 2025. However, Maman mentioned that during that period, the number of SMEs whose non-performing loans were successfully written off because they met restructuring criteria only reached 67,000 SMEs, far below the government's target of 1 million SMEs.",
