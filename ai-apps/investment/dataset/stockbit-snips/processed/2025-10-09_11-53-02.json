      "title": "Government Optimistic Loan Growth Will Accelerate to +10% YoY Along with Liquidity Injection Realization",
      "content": "The Director General at the Ministry of Finance, Febrio Kacaribu, on Thursday (10/9) announced the realization of credit disbursement from the liquidity injection totaling 200 trillion rupiah which was placed by the government into the state-owned bank holding company (Himbara) in September 2025. Based on Ministry of Finance data, approximately 113 trillion rupiah or about 56% of the total funds have been disbursed. This has made the Ministry of Finance optimistic that the industry-wide credit growth can increase to the level of +10% YoY by the end of 2025 (vs. 8M25: +7.56% YoY), in line with the 2025 target which was downgraded by Bank Indonesia to the range of +8-11% YoY. In general, Bank Mandiri recorded the highest disbursement rate at 74%, while Bank Tabungan Negara had the lowest disbursement rate at 19%. Both BMRI and Bank Syariah Indonesia target that all liquidity injection funds can be disbursed before the end of 2025, while Bank Rakyat Indonesia targets the remaining funds to be disbursed no later than the end of October 2025. See the table above for details of the realization of Himbara credit disbursement from the liquidity injection placed by the government as of October 9, 2025. Febrio stated that the majority of the liquidity injection funds placed by Himbara were directed to the housing, construction, and agriculture sectors. Meanwhile, BBRI stated that they also directed funding to the plantation, trade, and industry sectors. BRIS stated it will prioritize fund disbursement to government programs - such as Koperasi Desa Merah Putih and Free Nutritious Meals - as well as financing for MSMEs and housing for non-civil apparatus. The interest that Himbara needs to pay on government deposits will decrease from approximately 3.8% to 2% if the funds are disbursed to the Koperasi Desa Merah Putih program. The President Director of BBRI, Hery Gunardi, hopes that the Ministry of Finance can add placement funds at BBRI so the company can accelerate financing to the productive sector, considering that credit disbursement to this sector is relatively easy due to high demand. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, claimed that BMRI will likely also request additional fund placements so it can disburse credit to the property and automotive sectors. Currently, the government also plans to inject funds into regional development banks, with Purbaya stating that funds will be placed into Bank Jakarta and Bank Pembangunan Daerah Jawa Timur amounting to approximately 5-10 trillion rupiah each. Separately, Purbaya asked Bank Negara Indonesia to accelerate credit growth starting in the next 2 months, while affirming that the government will withdraw fund placements at the bank if growth is assessed as weak. Purbaya claimed that BBNI management targets credit growth above +11% YoY in 2026 - higher than BBNI management's 2025 guidance in the range of +8-10% YoY.",

      "content": "The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Thursday (10/9) that the government plans to implement a 50% biodiesel mandatory or B50 in 2H26, but this discourse still depends on the results of trials. Bahlil also reiterated the plan to launch 10% ethanol-blended gasoline, with the ethanol to come from sugarcane or cassava. The International Copper Study Group (ICSG) estimates the global refined copper market will experience a deficit of 150,000 tons in 2026, reversing from the previous estimate in April 2025 which projected a surplus throughout 2026 reaching 209,000 tons. This estimate is based on supply tightening concerns due to force majeure at PT Freeport Indonesia's Grasberg mine and mining disruptions in Chile and Congo. These incidents led ICSG to revise down the projection for copper mine production growth during 2025 from +2.3% YoY to +1.4% YoY, which will narrow the refined copper market surplus during 2025 from the previously estimated level of 289,000 tons to 178,000 tons. ICSG estimates refined copper production growth will slow down from +3.4% YoY in 2025 to +0.9% in 2026, as the limited availability of copper concentrate will offset the increase in output from scrap. Nevertheless, ICSG revised down the growth of global refined copper usage in 2026 from +3% YoY to +2.1% because consumption growth in China is expected to slow down. Bank Indonesia projects September 2025 retail sales to grow +5.8% YoY, although it is projected to contract -0.3% MoM. In August 2025, retail sales recorded growth of +3.5% YoY and +0.6% MoM (vs. July 2025: +4.7% YoY, -4.1% MoM), better than Bank Indonesia's forecast which expected growth of +2.7% YoY and -0.3% MoM. The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded that domestic motorcycle sales in September 2025 reached 567,173 units (+7.3% YoY, -1.9% MoM). This result led domestic motorcycle sales during 9M25 to reach approximately 4.8 million units (-0.7% YoY), equivalent to 72-76% of AISI's 2025 target in the range of 6.4-6.7 million units (vs. 9M24: 77% realization in 2024). Bloomberg reports that Indonesia will halt scrap-metal imports indefinitely to prevent further contamination from radioactive Caesium 137. This step was taken after the task force for handling radioactive contamination found traces of radioactive Caesium 137 in 22 plants located in the Cikande Modern Industrial Estate. Task force spokesperson, Bara Hasibuan, did not elaborate on the names of the contaminated production facilities but stated that they will immediately execute the decontamination procedure carried out by the National Nuclear Energy Agency. SBI Holdings bought approximately 1.04 billion shares of Bank Amar Indonesia (AMAR) at an average price of 230 rupiah per share on October 8, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 238 billion rupiah. After this transaction, SBI Holdings' ownership in AMAR increased from none to approximately 5.64%.",
