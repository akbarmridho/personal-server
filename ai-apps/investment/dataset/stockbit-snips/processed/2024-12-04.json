      "title": "OPEC+ to postpone planned production increase",
      "content": "The OPEC+ delegation said the organization is getting closer to an agreement to postpone the planned increase in oil production by 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) for three months, which was originally scheduled to start in January 2025. The plan is an effort by OPEC+ to maintain oil supply as oil prices (Brent) remain weak, hovering around US$70 per barrel (down 2.5% YTD). Brent even fell below US$70 per barrel in September (10/9), marking the lowest level since the end of 2023. A formal decision is scheduled for Thursday (5/12). OPEC+ has undertaken various measures to support oil prices. In total, OPEC+ has cut production by 5.86 million bpd – equivalent to 5.7% of global demand – since 2022. The cuts consist of voluntary cuts of 2.2 million bpd and mandatory cuts of 3.66 million bpd. Initially, OPEC+ planned to start phasing out voluntary cuts in October 2024, but this was postponed for two months, until December 2024, due to weakening oil prices. Despite the postponement, total OPEC+ production is still expected to rise in 2025. In June 2024, OPEC+ agreed on a production increase for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of 300,000 bpd gradually starting January 2025. Additionally, Kazakhstan plans to expand the Tengiz oil field, potentially boosting its oil output. Following the production postponement news, Brent strengthened by more than 2% on Tuesday (3/12) and edged up another 0.2% toward US$74 per barrel today (4/12). Driven by this positive sentiment, the shares of oil producers such as $MEDC (+5.6%) and $ENRG (+3.4%) rose today.",
