      "title": "Trump Leads Quick Count, IHSG Pressured",
      "content": "Donald Trump is projected to have secured more than 270 electoral votes and defeat Kamala Harris in the U.S. presidential election, according to the quick-count results released by Reuters, NBC News and The New York Times on Wednesday (6 Nov) local time. In general, Trump is proposing protectionist policies focused on domestic economic development, including: • Reducing the corporate tax rate to 15% (from the previous 21%). • Imposing import duties of 10-20% on all imported goods, with a 60% duty specifically on China. In response to the projected Trump victory, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) rose +1.32% to 104.8 on Wednesday (6 Nov). The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose +12 bps to 4.4%. In Indonesia, the news of Trump’s win pushed the rupiah down –0.6% to 15,840, the lowest level in three months. The 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose +11 bps to 6.85%. The weakening also affected other emerging-market currencies, with the Malaysian ringgit down 1.3% and the Philippine peso down 0.58% on the day. Following the rupiah’s decline, Bank Indonesia’s Monetary and Securities Asset Management Director Fitra Jusdiman said the central bank is ready to stabilize the rupiah, planning a three-pronged intervention targeting the spot FX market, the domestic non-deliverable forward market and the secondary government-bond market.",

      "content": "The key takeaway is that Trump’s protectionist policies could strengthen the U.S. dollar, which may negatively affect the IDX as foreign investors pull out, especially from companies with large dollar-denominated debt or import exposure. The policy could also dampen Indonesia’s economic growth, given the United States is Indonesia’s second-largest net export market. On the day of trading, Wednesday (6 Nov), foreign investors recorded an outflow of IDR 1.1 trillion, with major banks such as BMRI (-5.4%; outflow IDR 583 bn), BBNI (-5.1%; outflow IDR 132 bn) and BBRI (-2.3%; outflow IDR 480 bn) falling sharply. Companies with large dollar-denominated debt or import exposure also fell, including ICBP (-3.6%), PWON (-5.3%) and MAPI (-5.8%). The rupiah’s weakness narrows the space for Bank Indonesia to cut rates; Bloomberg forecasts a 25 bps rate cut by the end of 2024.",
