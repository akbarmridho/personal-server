      "content": "Bank Mandiri reported net profit of IDR 11.3 trillion in 2Q25 (-19% YoY, -15% QoQ). The 1H25 net profit was IDR 24.5 trillion (-8% YoY), below expectations at 44% of the 2025F consensus (vs. 48% actual in 1H24). The weak profit was mainly due to a 35% YoY increase in OPEX for 2Q25 and a 25% YoY rise for 1H25, driven by a one-off audit adjustment estimated at 10-12% of the 2025F OPEX estimate. Most of the adjustment was booked in June 2025, with the remainder to be booked in the coming months. Management expects 2025 OPEX to grow roughly in line with the 1H25 increase (+25% YoY). For 2026, OPEX is expected to be flat versus 2025 in the base case or rise low-single-digit in the bear case. Net interest income grew +8% YoY/+7% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, while loan loss provisions rose only +2% YoY/+5% YoY. The bank revised its 2025 guidance for credit growth and net interest margin, while cost of credit is expected to improve thanks to stable NPL and LAR. The guidance cut assumes a government liquidity injection of IDR 55 trillion and an expected 50-basis-point BI rate cut by end-2025. Management says further clarification on the use of the liquidity injection is needed.",
