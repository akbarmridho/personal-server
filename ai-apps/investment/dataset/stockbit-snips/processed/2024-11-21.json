      "content": "The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) reported that national coal production reached 711.37 million tonnes as of 15 November 2024, surpassing the 2024 government target of 710 million tonnes. The 2024 target is itself 2.2% higher than the 2023 target of 695 million tonnes. Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, Gita Mahyarani, predicts that national coal production for 2024 will be around 800 million tonnes, 3.2% higher than the 2023 realization of 775 million tonnes. Of the total national coal production as of 15 November 2024, 50.6% (359 million tonnes) was exported, representing 69.3% of the 2023 export realization. The strong national coal output through mid‑November 2024 is also reflected in the production volumes of coal‑producing issuers during 9M24:",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that analysts see Bank Indonesia likely to implement slower and smaller benchmark interest‑rate cuts due to global uncertainty that threatens rupiah stability. Most analysts expect a longer pause in rate cuts because of geopolitical tension and protective policies from the Donald Trump administration, which could delay U.S. Federal Reserve easing and boost demand for safe‑haven assets such as the U.S. dollar. Bloomberg noted that some analysts still forecast a BI Rate cut in December 2024, but the majority anticipate a wait until 2025. Bloomberg Economics also does not rule out a possible rate hike within 12 months if financial market volatility worsens.",
