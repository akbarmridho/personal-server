      "title": "Finance Minister Optimistic about Indonesia Economy +5.5% YoY in Q4 2025",
      "content": "Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa said on Tuesday (30/9) that he is optimistic Indonesia's economic growth in Q4 2025 can reach +5.5% YoY. The growth, according to Purbaya, will occur across the board, but will be most visible in the property sector – driven by increased bank credit disbursement – and in the food and beverage sector due to higher economic activity. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto also expressed optimism for Q4 2025 growth, which he expects to be driven by government spending including fiscal stimulus during the Christmas and New Year holidays amounting to about 2 billion US dollars or roughly 30 trillion rupiah. By comparison, a Bloomberg consensus survey in September 2025 projected Indonesia's Q4 2025 growth at only +4.7% YoY. In a separate statement, Purbaya emphasized that he will not consider loosening the fiscal deficit limit until the economy grows faster with more efficient spending. On Wednesday (1/10), BPS released inflation and trade balance data that exceeded consensus expectations. Indonesia's inflation in September 2025 was recorded at 2.65% YoY (vs. August 2025: 2.31% YoY, September 2024: 1.84% YoY), higher than the consensus estimate of 2.5% YoY. Core inflation was 2.19% YoY in September 2025 (vs. August 2025: 2.17% YoY, September 2024: 2.09% YoY), slightly below the consensus estimate of 2.2% YoY. The trade surplus reached USD 5.49 billion in August 2025 (vs. July 2025: USD 4.17 billion, August 2024: USD 2.76 billion), surpassing the consensus forecast of USD 3.99 billion. This result was driven by export growth of +5.78% YoY in August 2025, above the consensus level of +5% YoY, while imports fell -6.56% YoY, lower than the consensus expectation of -2% YoY. Key Takeaway: We assess that core inflation remains low and credit growth is still slow, indicating that up to August 2025 there are no clear signs of increased consumer purchasing power or demand. Therefore, investors should monitor the impact of various government initiatives – such as liquidity injections, fiscal stimulus, and overall increased government spending – as well as Bank Indonesia's interest rate cuts. Meanwhile, the release of trade balance data and news of a US government shutdown appear to provide positive sentiment for the rupiah, which on Wednesday (1/10) strengthened by +0.3% to 16,610 per US dollar.",
