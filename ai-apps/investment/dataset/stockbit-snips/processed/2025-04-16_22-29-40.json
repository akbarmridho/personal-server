      "title": "Government Officially Changes Minerba Royalty Rates",
      "content": "The Government officially increased royalty rates for several mineral commodities - such as nickel, copper, and gold - through Government Regulation No. 19/2025. Additionally, the government also adjusted royalties for coal commodity producers operating under a Special Mining Business Permit (IUPK) through Government Regulation No. 18/2025.\n\nBoth regulations are relatively similar to the proposals submitted by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) in early March 2025 - which we previously summarized in the Stockbit Commentary - where the majority of mineral commodities experienced royalty rate increases, while coal producers with IUPK permits experienced a decrease in rates.\n\nHowever, the final increase in royalty rates for ferronickel and nickel matte commodities is lower than the previous proposal. Previously, the ESDM Ministry proposed that the royalty rate for ferronickel be in the range of 5-7% and for nickel matte be in the range of 4.5-6.5%. In the final regulation, the royalty rate for ferronickel ranges from 4-6%, while nickel matte is around 3.5-5.5%.\n\nMeanwhile, there is no information yet regarding the royalty tax for coal issuers operating under a Coal Mining Concession Agreement (PKP2B) permit and IUP.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway: Impact of Royalty Rate Changes",
      "content": "We assess that these royalty rate changes have the potential to pressure the performance of mineral producing issuers, such as Vale Indonesia ($INCO), Trimegah Bangun Persada ($NCKL), Aneka Tambang ($ANTM), Bumi Resources Minerals ($BRMS), and Amman Mineral Internasional ($AMMN). On the other hand, these royalty rate changes have the potential to boost the performance of coal producers with IUPK contracts - such as Adaro Andalan Indonesia ($AADI), Bumi Resources ($BUMI), and Indika Energy ($INDY). For illustration, the Reference Coal Price (HBA) in March 2025 was at the level of 128 US dollars per ton, so the royalty rate for these three issuers could potentially drop from 28% to 19%.\n\nIn a previous Stockbit Commentary, we attempted to calculate the potential impact of these royalty rate changes on the net profit of AADI, BUMI, and INDY. Based on our analysis, BUMI is the issuer that benefits the most with a potential net profit increase in 2025 of +142% YoY, followed by INDY (+126% YoY), and AADI (+21.9% YoY), based on the main assumption of the average Newcastle coal price at the level of 110 US dollars per ton.",

In response, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Jian, stated that if the US truly wants to resolve the issue through dialogue and negotiation, the US must stop using maximum pressure and cease threats and blackmail.\n2. China's national statistics bureau recorded that China's economic growth reached +5.4% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: +5.4% YoY), exceeding consensus expectations at +5.1% YoY and remaining the strongest annual growth since 3Q23. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in March 2025 fell to 5.2% (vs. Feb 2025: 5.4%), better than the consensus expectation of 5.3%. In other data, retail sales in China grew +5.9% YoY in March 2025 (vs. 2M25: +4% YoY), exceeding consensus expectations of +4.2% YoY.\n3. Bank Indonesia estimates that Indonesian retail sales will grow +0.5% YoY and +8.3% MoM in March 2025. Meanwhile, the realization of retail sales in February 2025 was recorded at +2% YoY and +3.3% MoM (vs. Jan 2024: +0.5% YoY, -4.7% MoM), exceeding Bank Indonesia's forecast of -0.5% YoY and +0.8% MoM.\n4. Bank Indonesia noted that the Indonesian Consumer Confidence Index in March 2025 dropped to 121.1 (vs. Feb 2025: 126.4), marking a decline for 3 consecutive months although still in an optimistic range. This result was driven down by a decrease across all sub-indices.\n5. Minister of ESDM, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Tuesday (15/4) that the Indonesian government proposes increasing oil and LPG imports from the US by around 10 billion US dollars as part of a negotiation proposal to avoid a 32% tariff from the US. During 2024, the US contributed about 57% of Indonesia's total LPG imports, which reached 217,000 barrels of LPG per day, and supplied about 4.2% of Indonesia's total oil imports, which reached 306,000 barrels per day.\n6. Japfa Ltd. (SGX: UD2) shareholders on Tuesday (15/4) approved the plan to go private, with an estimated delisting date from the Singapore exchange falling on June 3, 2025.

Ecocare Indo Pasifik ($HYGN) plans to conduct a share buyback with an allocation fund of up to 5 billion rupiah from April 15 to July 15, 2025, although the company did not specify the maximum number of shares to be purchased.

The controller of Hillcon ($HILL), PT Hillcon Equity Management, sold 10 million HILL shares at a price of 320 rupiah per share on April 11, 2025. The total transaction value reached 3.2 billion rupiah. After this transaction, the ownership of PT Hillcon Equity Management in HILL decreased from 57.54% to 57.47%.",
