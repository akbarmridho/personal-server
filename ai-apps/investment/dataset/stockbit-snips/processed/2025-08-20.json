      "title": "BI Rate Cut to 5%, Outside Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (20 August 2025) cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to a level of 5%, contrary to the consensus expectation of no change. The deposit facility and lending facility were also each cut by 25 basis points to 4.25% and 5.75% respectively. With this decision, BI has reduced the BI Rate by a total of 100 basis points since the beginning of 2025.\n\nGovernor Perry Warjiyo said the move was taken to stimulate economic growth while the rupiah exchange rate remains stable and inflation is projected to stay low within the target range of 1.5-3.5%. Perry added that the central bank will continue to monitor the possibility of further rate cuts to support higher economic growth.\n\nBloomberg reported that the decision to cut rates for the second consecutive month amid 2Q25 economic growth that exceeded expectations indicates that Bank Indonesia is steering its policy closer to the government’s target, where the 2026 State Budget (RAPBN 2026) aims for a 5.4% YoY economic growth. This target is higher than the 1H25 realization of 4.99% YoY and the 2025 budget outlook of around 4.7-5% YoY.\n\nPerry stated that the central bank now forecasts Indonesia’s 2025 economic growth at 5.1% YoY, above the midpoint of the central bank’s projection range of 4.6-5.4% YoY. This marks a change in wording compared with the July 2025 meeting when Perry only mentioned the growth range.\n\nIn response to the announcement, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 1.03% on Wednesday, while the 10-year government bond yield was relatively flat at 6.402% (down 1 basis point) and the rupiah weakened 0.15% to 16,270 per US dollar.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe trend of rate cuts and expectations of accelerated government spending could boost economic growth from the second half of 2025. Bank Indonesia also expects the US Federal Reserve to cut rates two more times this year, each by 25 basis points, providing room for further BI Rate reductions.\n\nSectorally, financial services (+1.18%) and property (+2.56%), which are sensitive to interest-rate movements, gained on the trading day.",

Bank Indonesia recorded that bank credit growth slowed to +7.03% YoY in the first seven months of 2025 (vs. +7.77% YoY in 1H25), marking the weakest growth since March 2022 and below the 2025 target that was downgraded by Bank Indonesia to a range of +8-11% YoY.

The Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Association, Edy Suyanto, told Bisnis on Tuesday (19 August) that members could potentially halt 50% of production capacity if gas suppliers continue to limit gas usage with a specific earth-gas base tariff (HGBT) at 48% and impose a surcharge of USD 17.8 per MMBtu. This surcharge is about 20% higher than the regasification gas price of USD 14.8 per MMBtu. Previously, Edy explained that the ceramic industry in West Java saw gas allocation drop from 60% to 48% due to restrictions imposed by Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) from 13-31 August 2025.",
