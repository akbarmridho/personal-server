This resulted in a full-year 2024 net profit of 1.17 trillion rupiah, a 23% increase year-on-year, slightly above consensus expectations and roughly in line with Stockbit's estimate of 103% of consensus. Management targets a minimum 10% year-on-year net-profit growth for 2024. The solid profit growth was driven by strong revenue growth and higher margins.\n\nRevenue from the core 'Herbal' segment rebounded to 943 billion rupiah in 4Q24, a 6% year-on-year increase and 118% quarter-on-quarter rise, after a 4% year-on-year decline in 3Q24. Total revenue grew 7% year-on-year in 4Q24 and 10% year-on-year for the full year, matching management guidance of at least 10% year-on-year growth. The revenue strength also lifted gross-margin to 62.9% in 4Q24 (vs. 62.3% in 4Q23 and 52.6% in 3Q24).\n\nSIDO reinvested gross profit in advertising and promotion (A&P), with A&P expense rising to 188 billion rupiah in 4Q24, up 17% year-on-year and 113% quarter-on-quarter. The A&P-to-revenue ratio increased from 10.9% in 2023 to 11.7% in 2024. Operating expense (OPEX) rose to 308 billion rupiah in 4Q24, a 26% year-on-year and 85% quarter-on-quarter increase, resulting in a core operating profit of 505 billion rupiah in 4Q24, flat year-on-year but up 133% quarter-on-quarter. Core operating profit for the full year grew 19% year-on-year to 1.47 trillion rupiah, with EBIT up 24% year-on-year.\n\nKey Takeaway: Management targets 10% year-on-year revenue and net-profit growth for 2025, higher than consensus forecasts of 8% growth. An earnings call for the 2024 results will be held on Monday, March 10.",
