      "title": "Uncertainty of HGBT Incentives",
      "content": "The Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramics Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, said that there has been no continuation regarding the natural gas incentive (HGBT) of 6.5 US dollars per MMBtu which ended on December 31, 2024. Based on a Tempo report, the expiration of the HGBT policy caused the price of gas used below the certain industrial gas allocation limit (AGIT) to rise from 6.5 US dollars per MMBtu to a commercial price above 10 US dollars per MMBtu. Edy also mentioned that Perusahaan Gas Negara ($PGAS) increased the surcharge or additional fee for industries using above the AGIT by +21.08%, from 13.85 US dollars per MMBtu to 16.77 US dollars per MMBtu from January 1 to March 31, 2025. Edy stated that the HGBT incentive initially succeeded in suppressing the gas cost component from 28-30% of total ceramic production costs to the level of 23-26%. However, gas supply disruptions in western and eastern Java since 2023, along with the application of a surcharge of 13.85 US dollars per MMBtu since May 2024, have pushed the gas cost component back above 30% of ceramic production costs. Edy has sent a letter to President Prabowo Subianto to save the national ceramics industry after foreign investors in Asaki indicated they would halt investment due to legal uncertainty. Meanwhile, PGAS has not commented on the surcharge and gas supply disruptions. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said on Friday (3/1) that the HGBT incentive is currently being evaluated. In December 2024, the Acting Director General of Oil and Gas at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dadan Kusdiana, signaled that the HGBT policy would continue in 2025 with a similar price, around 6 US dollars per MMBTU. Additionally, Dadan stated that they received a recommendation from the Ministry of Industry to add 15 new sub-sectors as HGBT recipients. Previously, HGBT recipients only consisted of 7 industrial sectors: ceramics, fertilizer, petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, glass, and rubber gloves. Key Takeaway PGAS potentially enjoys higher margins with the expiration of the HGBT incentive at the beginning of 2025 and the increase in surcharge rates. On the other hand, the increase in gas prices will have a negative impact on industries with high gas energy cost components. Nevertheless, this impact is still short-term as the HGBT policy is still being discussed by the government. Based on the market close today, Monday (6/1), the price of PGAS increased by +7.52%, while the stock prices of several issuers sensitive to gas prices moved mixed: $TPIA (-5.23%), $ARNA (-1.45%), $MARK (-0.46%), $AMFG (+1.16%), $CAKK (+1.34%).",

      "content": "Regarding Friday, January 3, 2025, Stockbit Snips reported that PT Industri Jamu dan Farmasi Sido Muncul ($SIDO) targeted revenue and net profit growth of low-single digit. This information was incorrect; the accurate information is that SIDO targets revenue and net profit growth of low-double digit. The error has been corrected on the Stockbit Snips website page. Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, announced on Monday (6/1) that the 2024 State Budget deficit reached 2.29% of GDP, in line with the initial target although larger than the 2023 State Budget realization of 1.61% of GDP. This result is also lower than the Ministry of Finance's projection in September 2024, which estimated the 2024 State Budget deficit would widen to 2.7% of GDP. The government plans to issue 8 series of retail state securities (SBN) throughout 2025 as an instrument for financing the 2025 State Budget and a fixed income investment option for the public. The series and offering schedule are: ORI027 (January 27-February 20), ST014 (March 7-April 16), SR022 (May 16-June 18), SBR014 (July 14-August 7), SWR006 (August 15-October 15), SR023 (August 22-September 12), ORI028 (September 29-October 23), ST015 (November 10-December 3). Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, announced on Friday (3/1) that the government will allocate 15.62 million kiloliters of biodiesel to implement the B40 mandatory mix in 2025. This amount is an increase from the estimated biodiesel consumption of 12.98 million kiloliters for the B35 mandatory mix in 2024. Of the 2025 biodiesel allocation, 7.55 million kiloliters are designated for the public service obligation—where sales will be subsidized by the Palm Oil Plantation Fund Management Agency—while the remainder will be sold at market prices. Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi, stated that the government allows biodiesel producers and fuel retailers until February 28, 2025, to implement B40. Going forward, Bahlil mentioned that Indonesia will implement B50 starting in 2026, which he claimed will end the need for solar imports. Chairman of SKK Migas, Djoko Siswanto, stated that in 2025, they target oil lifting at 605 MBOPD (vs. 2024 target: 596.4 MBOPD) and gas lifting at 1,005 MBOEPD (vs. 2024 target: 991 MBOPD), in line with the 2025 State Budget target. SKK Migas has not yet announced the realization of 2024 oil and gas lifting. However, based on the outlook in mid-2024, SKK Migas predicted that 2024 oil lifting would reach 595 MBOPD, with gas lifting at 993 MBOPD. The Directorate General of Taxes released Director General of Taxes Regulation No. PER-01/PJ/2025 to address cases of erroneous Value Added Tax (VAT) collection rates. The regulation states that buyers can request a refund for the over-collected VAT amounting to 1 percentage point from the seller, whereupon the VAT taxable entrepreneur (PKP) seller will issue a tax invoice replacement. Previously, the government's decision to cancel the effective VAT rate increase for general goods and services resulted in cases of VAT over-collection by 1 percentage point, where it was collected at 12% instead of the required 11%. The Institute for Supply Management noted that the US manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reached 49.3 in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 48.4), exceeding the consensus expectation of 48.4. Although still in contraction territory, this is the best US manufacturing PMI result since March 2024 when it reached 50.3, which was the only period of expansion in the US industry since September 2022. Freeport Indonesia Spokesperson, Katri Krisnati, stated that they are currently discussing with the government the possibility of relaxing copper concentrate exports until the company's smelter in JIIPE, Gresik, resumes full operation. Previously, the copper smelter caught fire in October 2024, prompting PT Freeport Indonesia to request an extension for the copper concentrate export relaxation which ended in late 2024. Katri mentioned that repairs at the smelter are ongoing and operations improvement is expected to commence around mid-2025. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that the government is considering PT Freeport Indonesia's request, with a decision expected following a meeting with President Prabowo Subianto.",
