      "content": "Reuters reported that the latest draft of the Financial Sector Development and Strengthening Bill (P2SK) no longer contains explicit provisions allowing the DPR (House of Representatives) to recommend the dismissal of Bank Indonesia's board of governors, although the latest regulation includes a provision that the performance of the central bank and other financial regulators will be reviewed by the DPR. Although the DPR's authority over Bank Indonesia is softer in the latest draft, Reuters reported that this can still raise concerns among investors regarding the risk of political interference, considering the DPR currently consists of a large coalition of President Prabowo Subianto. Reuters also reported that the latest version of the Bill has a provision requiring Bank Indonesia to implement \"policies and policy mixes that create a conducive economic environment for real sector growth and job creation,\" confirming previous reports regarding plans to expand Bank Indonesia's mandate. The Chairman of Commission XI of the DPR, Mukhamad Misbakhun, told Reuters that this latest version of the Bill will be brought to the plenary session to be enacted into law.\nTin futures prices on the London Metal Exchange rose +1.7% to 36,013 US dollars per ton at the close of trading on Wednesday (1/10), driven by potential tightening of global supply due to crackdowns on illegal mining in Indonesia. With this price increase, Bloomberg reported that tin prices have jumped +24% year-to-date. Earlier, President Prabowo Subianto ordered authorities earlier this week to close tin smuggling routes mined illegally from 1,000 mining locations in Bangka Belitung.\nThe DPR plenary meeting on Thursday (2/10) approved the revision of Law No. 19/2003 concerning State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) into law. This new regulation will replace the Ministry of BUMN with the BUMN Regulatory Agency (BP BUMN). In addition, there are at least 11 other substantive points changed from the previous BUMN Law, such as the prohibition of simultaneous tenure for ministers and deputy ministers as BUMN officials, up to the arrangement of the investment holding structure and operational holding company at BPI Danantara.\nPT Freeport Indonesia President Director, Tony Wenas, said on Thursday (2/10) that the plan to divest 12% of PT Freeport Indonesia shares from Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) to the government is still under discussion among stakeholders. Previously, Danantara CEO, Rosan Roeslani, claimed that this transaction would be completed soon, adding that the transfer of shares would be free of charge. Nevertheless, Danantara CIO, Pandu Sjahrir, told Bloomberg that this transaction is not free, although he did not elaborate further. Currently, the government through MIND ID holds a 51% ownership in PT Freeport Indonesia.",

      "title": "Petrosea ($PTRO) Projects EBITDA to Grow +70% CAGR in 2024-2026F",
      "content": "Petrosea ($PTRO) in an information disclosure related to its public expose material projects consolidated EBITDA in 2026F to reach 306 million US dollars, a higher +61% compared to Stockbit's estimate which we wrote in Unboxing Mining Contractor Sector. Overall, the company's revenue and EBITDA are projected to increase at a CAGR of +42% and +70% in 2024-2026F, respectively. Here are some important notes from us regarding PTRO's performance projections:\nThe company expects revenue to grow +43% YoY to 991 million US dollars in 2025F and +41% YoY to 1.4 billion US dollars in 2026F. Consolidated EBITDA is projected to grow higher, +91% YoY to 203 million US dollars in 2025F and +51% YoY to 306 million US dollars in 2026F. For context, revenue projections for 2025F and 2026F conveyed by the company are respectively +9% and +45% higher than Stockbit's estimates, while EBITDA projections for 2025F and 2026F are respectively +21% and +61% higher than Stockbit's estimates.\nPTRO bases its revenue and EBITDA growth projections on organic growth and contributions from the HBS group and the Hafar group acquired this year. The contribution of both is expected to push up PTRO's EBITDA margin to 22% in 2026F, compared to an estimate of 21% without the acquisition. The HBS Group is engaged in mining services and construction solutions in Papua New Guinea, while the Hafar group is a company in the offshore engineering, procurement, construction, and installation sector.\nSynergy HBS Group: Regional Expansion, Better EBITDA Margin\nThe company explained that the acquisition of the HBS group expands PTRO's footprint to Papua New Guinea by utilizing the HBS group's operational base and customer network, such as Newmont, St. Barbara, and Harmony Gold. Furthermore, PTRO plans to optimize funding, HR, and procurement sides through its internal ecosystem. PTRO estimates that the EBITDA margin from HBS will reach 30% in 2026F, higher than the projected PTRO EBITDA margin before the acquisition at 21% in 2026F. For context, PTRO announced plans to acquire 100% of the HBS Group shares on August 1, 2025, with a total transaction value of 25.8 million US dollars or approximately 429.3 billion rupiah.\nSynergy Hafar Group: Expansion of Offshore Oil and Gas Industry Business\nPTRO explained that the acquisition of the Hafar group aims to open new business opportunities for the company into the offshore EPCI and shipping business — specifically barges for pipeline installation — while gaining access to networks of key clients in the oil and gas and LNG industries, such as Pertamina and Petronas. Similar to HBS, PTRO plans to optimize funding, HR, and procurement sides. The company also projects that the EBITDA margin from the Hafar group will reach 34% in 2026F. For context, PTRO, through its subsidiary, PT Petrosea Engineering Procurement Construction, announced the acquisition of 51% in 2 Hafar group business entities on August 15, 2025, with a transaction value of approximately 400 billion rupiah, while the remaining 49% was acquired by Rukun Raharja ($RAJA) for 384 billion rupiah.\nKey Takeaway\nWe view this performance projection release positively, given that previously there was no information regarding the contribution of acquired companies, such as potential additional revenue, margin profiles, and client networks. Specifically regarding margins, we assess that the EBITDA margins of both companies being >30% in 2026F are relatively high levels, which can positively impact PTRO's overall EBITDA margin. We see that the potential additional EBITDA from these two acquisitions will exceed the impact of increased financial expenses (from acquisition financing), thus still positively impacting the company's net profit.",
