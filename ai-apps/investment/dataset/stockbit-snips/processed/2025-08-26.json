      "title": "Danantara Releases Patriot Bonds Worth Rp50 Trillion",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara plans to issue Patriot Bonds worth 50 trillion rupiah on 1 October 2025. The bond issuance is said to consist of two series with tenors of 5 years and 7 years, each worth 25 trillion rupiah and carrying a coupon of 2%, below the yield of comparable government bonds of around 6%. Because of the low yield, the bonds will be offered through a private placement to a number of national business leaders. Danantara’s Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Pandu Sjahrir, explained that the bonds are a strategic financing instrument commonly used in various countries, such as Japan and the United States, to strengthen national financing independence. The issuance is supported by several conglomerates including Prajogo Pangestu, Franky Widjaja, and Boy Thohir. Through its official LinkedIn page, Danantara said the funds raised from the bonds will be invested in the energy transition sector and others. Bloomberg also reported that the funds will be used for waste-to-energy (WTE) projects. The bond issuance is scheduled only one day after the Minister of Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan, said that the Presidential Regulation concerning WTE is expected to be issued within one to two days. According to the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL) of PLN for 2025, the development of waste-to-energy power plants based on environmentally friendly technology will be located in 12 cities: Palembang, Tangerang, South Tangerang, Jakarta, Bandung, Bekasi, Semarang, Surakarta, Surabaya, Makassar, Manado and Denpasar, with a total installed capacity of 453 MW by 2034. Key Takeaway The planned bond issuance provides positive sentiment to issuers that have exposure to the WTE business and its ecosystem such as $TOBA and $OASA, whose share prices rose respectively by +17.9% and +24.3% on the trading day Tuesday (26/8). TOBA completed in March 2025 the acquisition of Sembcorp Environment, a Singapore household waste management company located in Jurong. Meanwhile, OASA plans to partner with a Chinese company to build a solar-powered waste processing plant at the Cipeucang landfill in Serpong. The project is estimated at 1.69 trillion rupiah and will generate 15.7 MW of electricity.",

This result makes net profit bank only for 7M25 reach 28.6 trillion rupiah (-9% YoY), equal to 50.3% of the 2025F consolidated consensus estimate (vs. 7M24 bank only: 52.2% actual consolidation 2024).

Cumulatively for 7M25, profit decline was driven by: 1) weak PPOP -4% YoY due to opex increase +10% YoY; and 2) provision expenses increased +4% YoY. As of July 2025, bank-only credit growth was +5% YoY, relatively stable compared with June 2025.",
