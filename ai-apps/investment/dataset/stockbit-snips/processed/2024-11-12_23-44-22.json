      "title": "Awaiting the 2025 Provincial Minimum Wage UMP Formula",
      "content": "The Government will announce the formula for determining the 2025 provincial minimum wage (UMP) in the near future. This formula will replace the UMP determination formula in Government Regulation No. 51/2023, which was annulled by the Constitutional Court last week as the labor cluster was removed from the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. The Vice President of the Confederation of Indonesian Workers Unions, Kahar S. Cahyono, stated that his party held a meeting with the DPR and the government on Wednesday (6/11). In the meeting, Kahar mentioned that the Ministry of Manpower proposed that the alpha variable in the UMP formula be divided based on industry type, with the alpha variable for labor-intensive industries in the range of 0.2-0.5 and capital-intensive industries around 0.2-0.8. This proposal from the Ministry of Manpower is lower than the request from the Confederation of Indonesian Workers Unions, which wanted an alpha variable around 1-1.2 to maintain community purchasing power in 2025. The alpha variable itself is a specific index representing the contribution of labor to the economic growth of the province or city/regency. In Government Regulation No. 51/2023, the alpha variable was set around 0.1-0.3, where this figure would be multiplied by economic growth before being added to the inflation rate to determine the UMP increase rate. Meanwhile, a different proposal was submitted by the President of the All Indonesia Workers Union Association, Mirah Sumirat. Mirah stated that her party proposed that the 2025 UMP determination formula should take into account future inflation and economic growth projections. Mirah also mentioned that they proposed the 2025 UMP calculation should also consider 64 items of a decent living wage component. Besides changing the UMP determination formula, the government will also re-implement the sectoral wage (UMS) which was previously removed in the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. The deadline for UMP determination falls on November 21, 2024, with the announcement schedule for regency/city minimum wages no later than November 30, 2024. Nevertheless, labor observer, Timboel Siregar, said that the government needs to postpone the deadline for the 2025 UMP determination so that discussions at the Regional Wage Council are not rushed.",

On the other hand, higher UMP increases can suppress profitability for issuers with a high proportion of opex from employee salaries, such as ACES, AMRT, and MAPI. In addition, we also assess that the UMP increase rate needs to consider the industry's ability to survive—given the layoffs that have occurred recently—so that it does not boomerang against consumption.",

Sonny also mentioned that the government's plan to impose import duties on imported milk is counterproductive because it will increase the selling price of milk products to consumers who are currently facing purchasing power challenges. According to the Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Ferry Juliantono, the price of imported milk is cheaper by about 1,000-2,000 per liter. To encourage domestic milk absorption, Ferry stated that his party proposes incentives for domestic breeders or re-examines the potential application of import duties on imported milk. This step is a government response to the action of discarding milk production by dairy farmers last week.",
