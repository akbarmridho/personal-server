      "title": "Automotive Wholesales: Cars down 14% YoY in 2024, Motorcycles up 1.5% YoY",
      "content": "Gaikindo reported that national automobile wholesales in December 2024 reached 79,806 units (-6.4% YoY, +6.6% MoM). This result made total automobile wholesales for 2024 amount to 865,723 units (-14% YoY), equal to 102% of Gaikindo’s revised 2024 target of 850,000 units.\n\nAstra International (ASII) recorded wholesales of 42,158 units (-11.5% YoY, +7% MoM) in December 2024, worse than the industry average, causing its market share to fall to 52.8% (December 2023: 56%, November 2024: 52.6%). By brand, Daihatsu was the main driver of ASII’s wholesales in December 2024 with 13,057 units (+2% YoY, +30% MoM), while Toyota+Lexus sales reached 26,667 units (-17% YoY, -1.2% MoM). Cumulatively for 2024, ASII posted wholesales of 482,964 units (-14% YoY), in line with the industry decline, keeping its cumulative market share stable at 55.8% (2023: 55.7%).\n\nAmong ASII’s main competitors, Mitsubishi posted the relatively best performance in 2024 with wholesales of 99,938 units (-8.3% YoY), raising its market share to 11.5% (2023: 10.8%). Conversely, Honda was the weakest competitor, with sales dropping 32% YoY to 94,742 units. BYD recorded wholesales of 1,563 units in December 2024 and 15,429 units since it began deliveries in June 2024. Based on average monthly sales since June 2024, BYD’s wholesales (~2,200 units) have surpassed Wuling (~2,050 units) and Hyundai (~1,750 units).\n\nGaikindo Chairman I Jongkie Sugiarto said the association remains optimistic that automobile wholesales will recover to 1 million units in 2025, despite the value-added tax (VAT) increasing to 12% and the implementation of a tax offset scheme. According to Lydia Kurniawati Christyana, Director of the Ministry of Finance, the 2025 tax offset will not increase the burden on society because it will be accompanied by a reduction in motor vehicle tax rates and vehicle ownership transfer fees.\n\nThe Indonesian Motorbike Industry Association (AISI) reported that domestic motorcycle sales reached 403,480 units (-5.5% YoY, -21.3% MoM) in December 2024. This result brings total domestic motorcycle sales for 2024 to 6.3 million units (+1.5% YoY), in line with AISI’s 2024 target of 6.2-6.5 million units. AISI targets domestic motorcycle sales of 6.4-6.7 million units in 2025.\n\nKey Takeaway: Although automobile wholesales are projected to recover to 1 million units in 2025, investors should monitor the impact of the 12% VAT and tax-offset implementation on sales in the early months of the year. Besides taxation, the launch of new models is another factor that could affect automobile sales. The presence of affordable hybrid cars priced around 300 million rupiah could act as a positive catalyst.\n\nWe also anticipate that motorcycle sales performance in 2025 will remain better than automobile sales, driven by factors such as the unchanged VAT for most motorcycles sold in Indonesia and a government stimulus package aimed at the lower-middle income segment.",
