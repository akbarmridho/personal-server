      "title": "ðŸš— Wholesales Car Sales -3% YoY in 4M25",
      "content": "Gaikindo recorded that national car wholesales in April 2025 reached 51,205 units (+5% YoY, -28% MoM). This result caused the wholesales realization for 4M25 to become 256,368 units (-3% YoY), relatively in line with expectations, equivalent to 28-34% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 4M24: 30% of 2024 realization). Astra International ($ASII) itself recorded a sale of 26,976 units in April 2025 (+0% YoY, -29% MoM), growing lower compared to the industry, so ASII's market share dropped to 52.7% (vs. Apr 2024: 55.2%, Mar 2025: 53.2%). ASII car wholesales in April 2025 were supported by Toyota + Lexus sales of 16,268 units (+5% YoY, -28% MoM), while Daihatsu sales were suppressed to 8,884 units (-6% YoY, -32% MoM). Cumulatively, ASII car wholesales during 4M25 fell to 137,788 units (-6% YoY), with market share dropping to 53.7% (vs. 4M24: 55.5%). The still solid growth in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales is supporting Toyota's sales. Nevertheless, the significant growth in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales has caused the BEV segment to surpass HEV sales as of 1Q25. The rapid growth of BEV is also reflected in the sales of BYD + Denza and Chery. As of April 2025, the market share of BYD + Denza and Chery has increased to 8.4% and 3.2% respectively, up from the ~2% level recorded by both in December 2024. BYD's market share has made it the 4th largest selling brand in Indonesia as of April 2025, despite only entering Indonesia in mid-2024. Key Takeaway: The comparison of annual sales in April 2025 is also influenced by the effect of the shift in Lebaran seasonality. If only using sales in March and April 2025, total national car wholesales in those two months dropped slightly by -1% YoY to 122,100 units. Although still declining, we assess that this weak sales condition is already expected by the market.",
