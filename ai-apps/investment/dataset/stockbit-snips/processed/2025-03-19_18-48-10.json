      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (19/3) decided to maintain the reference interest rate, BI Rate, at the level of 5.75%, in line with consensus expectations. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that although there is still room for an interest rate cut, current global conditions do not yet permit it. Perry also added that Bank Indonesia will monitor currency movements, inflation, and economic growth to consider the steps they will take next. This decision by Bank Indonesia came just one day after the IHSG plummeted on Tuesday (18/3), which was partly driven by market concerns over Indonesia's economic outlook moving forward. Responding to market concerns this week, Perry said that this was \"more driven by technical factors\" due to global tariff concerns, and that Indonesian assets \"remain fundamentally attractive.\" Perry stated that Bank Indonesia maintained the economic growth and inflation outlook as conveyed in the Board of Governors Meeting in January 2025. As context, Bank Indonesia cut Indonesia's economic growth outlook for 2025 in that meeting, from a range of +4.8-5.6% YoY to +4.7-5.5% YoY. Following Bank Indonesia's decision to maintain the interest rate, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened by -0.6% to the level of 16,525 on Wednesday (19/3), while the IHSG closed stronger at +1.42% and the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose +6 bps to the level of 7.09%. The rupiah itself has weakened by -1.2% MoM against the US dollar. Going forward, Bank Indonesia expects the rupiah exchange rate to strengthen in line with its fundamentals, based on the attractive yield differential Indonesia offers to investors. Bank Indonesia will also continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market so that the rupiah exchange rate reflects the actual economic fundamentals. Bank Indonesia still projects that the Fed's interest rate will be cut by 25 bps throughout 2025, driven by tariff policies causing recession concerns in the US. However, Perry expects that the Fed will not rush to lower interest rates, given the current uncertainty and the slowing disinflation process in the US.",

      "content": "Although the decision to maintain the BI Rate was in line with economist consensus expectations, Bloomberg noted that 8 out of 25 economists expected Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates today, one of the reasons being to boost the economy. Recently, there have been various concerns surrounding economic growth, including a deflation of 0.09% YoY in February 2025 and the downward revision of the economic growth outlook by Bank Indonesia earlier this year. A total of 18 out of 32 economists expect Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by at least another 50 bps throughout 2025, while 11 out of 32 economists expect only a 25 bps cut in the BI Rate until the end of this year. Next, investors need to pay attention to: The US interest rate decision by the Fed on Wednesday (19/3) local time. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed maintaining the interest rate at that meeting reached 99%.

The decline in the 'Trading and Distribution' segment year-on-year was due to the normalization of average selling prices and volume disruptions related to weather in the mining sector.
