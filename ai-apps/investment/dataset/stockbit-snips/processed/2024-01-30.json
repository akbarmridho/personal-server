      "title": "Toyota: Masih Terlaris di Dunia, namun Muncul Skandal Baru",
      "content": "Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO: 7203) on Monday (29/1) announced that it will temporarily halt shipments of 10 car models due to diesel engine certification issues. The problem was discovered after an investigation committee found that the affected models have differences in horsepower output and Engine Control Unit (ECU) compared to the certification test. According to Toyota Motor Corp., one of the affected models is the Toyota Fortuner produced by PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (TMMIN). \n\nTMMIN Vice President Director Bob Azam claimed that the case is not related to vehicles in Indonesia, stating the issue concerns certification procedures in several countries other than Indonesia and does not affect vehicle safety or emissions. \n\nThe diesel engine certification issue comes a month after a scandal at its subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co., which was found to have manipulated safety tests on 64 car models. Consequently, Daihatsu will halt shipments and suspend operations at least until February 2024. \n\nMeanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. announced that global vehicle sales reached 11.2 million units in 2023, up 7.2% YoY, making Toyota the world’s best-selling car maker for the fourth consecutive year. Total Toyota and Lexus sales were 10.3 million units in 2023. Of that, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales rose 31.4% YoY to 3.4 million units, while battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales were only 104 thousand units. \n\nFor comparison, Toyota’s BEV competitors BYD and Tesla recorded 1.57 million units (+72.8% YoY) and 1.81 million units (+38% YoY) respectively in 2023.",
