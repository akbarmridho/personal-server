      "content": "Economists expect Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% in the upcoming board meeting on Wednesday (22/10), according to a Reuters survey. The expectation is based on the central bank’s likely emphasis on supporting economic growth despite a weakening rupiah. Last month, the central bank unexpectedly cut the BI Rate by 25 bps, reflecting an “all-out pro-growth” stance alongside expansive fiscal policy. Economists also project the BI Rate to fall to 4.25% by the end of 2025 and stay at that level through 2026.",

The result brings 9M25 net profit to IDR 43.4 trillion (+6 % YoY), matching the 75 % consensus for 2025F (vs. 75 % actual in 9M24). The company remained cautious in credit disbursement and raised provisions, yet management is optimistic for 4Q25 and 2026 as macro conditions improve with higher government spending and falling rates. Guidance for 2025 credit growth is kept at +6-8 % YoY, with September 2025 already at +8 % YoY. Cost of Credit is expected to be 0.5 % at year-end, lower than the 0.6 % level in 3Q25, supported by a quarterly NPL decline after two quarters of increase. Management sees 2026 credit growth possibly +8-10 % as loan-yield pressure eases. The bank may cut the policy rate once in 2025 and three times in 2026. A buy-back of up to IDR 5 trillion is planned for 22 Oct 2025-19 Jan 2026 at a maximum price of IDR 9,200 per share, subject to market conditions. Dividend payout discussion is ongoing; the payout ratio could rise from 67.4 % (2024) given a CAR of 29.9 % as of September 2025.",
