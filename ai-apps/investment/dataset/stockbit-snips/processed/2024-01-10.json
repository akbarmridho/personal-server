      "content": "OJK announced the realization of banking performance as of the end of November 2023. Credit disbursement grew +0.91% month-on-month and +9.74% year-on-year to IDR 6,966 trillion, in line with the target range of +9-11%. The growth was supported by state-owned banks, which recorded a credit growth of +12.13% YoY. Third-party funds (DPK) rose to IDR 8,216 trillion (+0.21% MoM, +3.04% YoY), with deposits growing the fastest at +3.5% YoY. Net NPL ratio improved to 0.75% (Oct 2023: 0.77%, Nov 2022: 0.75%). Gross NPL ratio improved to 2.36% (Oct 2023: 2.42%, Nov 2022: 2.65%). The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) tightened to 84.78% (Oct 2023: 84.19%; Nov 2022: 78.78%).\n\nThe Executive Director of Banking Supervision at OJK, Dian Ediana Rae, said that credit growth in 2024 is targeted to reach double-digit, based on banks’ business plans submitted to OJK.\n\nOJK also projects 2024 banking performance indicators as follows: Gross NPL 2-2.5%, LDR 84-86%, net profit growth +9-10% YoY.\n\nKey Takeaway: Slower DPK growth versus credit disbursement tightens liquidity (LDR rises), creating a “price war” for DPK (cost of funds rises). This is reflected in the 11-month 2023 YoY interest-expense increase for the big-four banks: BBCA +48%, BMRI +54%, BBNI +63%, BBRI +71%.\n\nWe expect cost of funds to fall as interest-rate cuts are expected. Currently, banks with lower LDR can use their liquidity to capture market share. LDR (big-four, Nov 2023): BBCA 71%, BBRI 87%, BMRI 88%, BBNI 91%.",
