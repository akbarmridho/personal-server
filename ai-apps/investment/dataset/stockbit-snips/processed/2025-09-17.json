      "title": "BI Rate Cut 25 Bps to 4.75%, Outside Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (17/9) cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 4.75%, outside the consensus expectation that it would remain unchanged. The lending facility was also cut by 25 bps to 5.5%, while the deposit facility was cut by 50 bps to 3.75%. With this decision, the BI Rate has fallen 125 bps since the beginning of 2025.\n\nGovernor Perry Warjiyo said the decision aims to boost economic growth while maintaining exchange rate stability and inflation in the 1.5-3.5% range for 2025 and 2026. He added that the cut also reflects the high probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the Wednesday meeting (17/9 local time) and a stable but weakening US dollar index (DXY). Perry emphasized that the authorities welcome the government's expansionary fiscal policy, including the placement of a 200 trillion rupiah government cash reserve in state-owned banks (Himbara), reflecting an \"all-out pro-growth\" stance by both state institutions.\n\nThe rate cut comes amid parliamentary discussions to expand the Bank Indonesia mandate and to give the DPR authority to recommend the dismissal of the Bank Indonesia governor, as outlined in a draft law amending Law No.4/2023 on Financial Sector Development (P2SK).\n\nKontan reported that the expanded mandate would include \"creating a conducive economic environment for real-sector growth and job creation.\" Currently, the BI mandate is limited to stabilising the rupiah, preserving payment system stability, and supporting financial system stability to foster sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe new provision allowing the DPR to recommend the removal of a governor could raise concerns about BI independence, according to Bloomberg. The concern resurfaced after BI and the government signed a new burden-sharing agreement.\n\nFollowing the rate cut, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) rose 0.85% to an all-time high of 8,025 on the day, while the 10-year government bond yield fell 5 bps and the rupiah remained modestly stronger at +0.06%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that the BI decision to further cut rates signals a clear priority on economic recovery, especially after the announcement of the third stimulus package in 2025 and liquidity injection to Himbara by the government. We also note the larger cut to the deposit facility compared with the BI Rate. The deposit facility rate, an overnight rate paid by BI on surplus funds placed by commercial banks, influences overnight interbank loan rates. The larger cut is expected to encourage banks to lend surplus funds as credit rather than placing them with the central bank. This initiative considers the slow transmission of the BI Rate cut, as BI reports that bank loan and deposit rates have only fallen 7 bps and 16 bps respectively since the start of the year up to August 2025.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia reported that bank credit growth reached +7.56% YoY for the first eight months of 2025 (vs. +7.03% YoY for the first seven months of 2025, and +11.4% YoY for the same period in 2024), lower than the 2025 target downgraded by BI to the +8-11% YoY range. Investment credit grew +13.86% YoY in the first eight months, while consumption credit grew +7.89% YoY and working-capital credit grew +3.53% YoY. On the funding side, third-party funds grew +8.51% YoY, and the loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 86.03%.\n\nPresident Prabowo Subianto reshuffled the Red-White Cabinet on Wednesday (17/9), moving Erick Thohir from the BUMN minister to the Youth and Sports minister and appointing Djamari Chaniago as the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi said the government has not yet appointed a definitive replacement for the BUMN minister.\n\nThe National Nutrition Agency announced on Tuesday (16/9) that the government plans to expand the Free Nutritious Meal program to teachers and posyandu volunteers, which currently only targets children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers.\n\nThe US Census Bureau recorded that US retail sales grew +0.6% MoM in August, beating consensus expectations of +0.2% MoM. Year-over-year, US retail sales rose +5% in August 2025 (vs. +4.1% YoY in July 2025). Reuters reported that despite the sales increase, economists expect the Fed to continue cutting rates at the Wednesday meeting (17/9) as the US labor market weakens.\n\nCoordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told Reuters on Wednesday (17/9) that the free trade agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA) will be signed in Bali on 23 September 2025. The statement followed a Financial Times report that EU Trade Commissioner Maros Šefčovič will visit Indonesia to sign the deal. Earlier, in June 2025, Airlangga said the agreement would grant Indonesia zero tariffs on almost 80% of its export products to the EU and remove non-tariff barriers, hoping the EU would expedite ratification so the agreement could be effective by the end of 2026 or 2027.\n\nTechno9 Indonesia (NINE) announced that Poh Holdings Pte. Ltd. has acquired approximately 773.4 million (35.85%) NINE shares from the controlling shareholder Heddy Kandou. About 413.3 million (19.16%) of the shares were purchased at roughly 12.2 rupiah per share, lower than the original agreement price of 19 rupiah per share, due to certain debt and liabilities assumed by the company. After completion, Poh Holdings will become the new controlling shareholder and will conduct a mandatory tender offer.",
