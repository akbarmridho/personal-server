      "content": "Indonesia's consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 1.71% year-on-year (YoY) in October 2024, the lowest level since October 2021, according to the Statistics Agency (BPS). The figure is down from 1.84% YoY in September 2024 and matches consensus expectations. Core inflation for October 2024 was 0.22% month-on-month (MoM) and 2.21% YoY, above the consensus forecast of 2.1% YoY. On a monthly basis, Indonesia recorded 0.08% MoM inflation (September 2024 showed a 0.12% MoM deflation), ending a five-month streak of monthly deflation and surpassing the consensus view of a flat reading. The monthly increase was driven mainly by personal care and other services, which rose 0.94% MoM, largely due to jewelry gold whose inflation contribution was 0.06 percentage points. On the same day, S&P Global reported that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.2 in October 2024, unchanged for a second consecutive month and marking a fourth straight month of contraction. Output and new orders continued to fall amid a weak market, while geopolitical uncertainty has caused export sales to decline for an eighth consecutive month. Employment contracted for the third time in four months and confidence fell to a four-month low, well below historical trends.",
