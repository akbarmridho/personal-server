      "content": "Companies owned by Prajogo Pangestu are preparing a total fund of up to IDR 5 trillion for share buyback between 24 March and 23 June 2025. The plan will not be discussed at the General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPS), following the relaxation issued by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) to support capital market stability. The relaxation allows issuers to conduct buybacks without RUPS approval for a period of six months starting 18 March 2025. The detailed buyback allocations for each company are provided in the accompanying tables. Key Takeaway: The share buyback actions may indicate confidence of Prajogo Pangestu-owned issuers in their fundamentals or value. While the purchases could boost optimism among some market participants and provide support for the IDX Composite (IHSG), we assess that an increase in investor confidence—especially from foreign investors—is required for a more significant IHSG recovery.",

He did not detail how Bank Indonesia's role could be enhanced, and no decision has been taken yet. The DPR is currently discussing Law No. 4/2023 on the development and strengthening of the financial sector, which raises concerns that the amendment could weaken Bank Indonesia's independence. Previously, Governor of Bank Indonesia Perry Warjiyo acknowledged that there were talks about the central bank's mandate in parliamentary discussions, but he expected no changes regarding that matter.",

      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded net profit (bank only) of IDR 4.6 trillion in February 2025, up 42 percent year-on-year and 129 percent month-on-month, a significant recovery from January 2025. This result caused the bank-only net profit for the first two months of 2025 to fall 18 percent YoY to IDR 6.6 trillion, worse than the consensus estimate of a 1.3 percent YoY decline for consolidated 2025F, due to a management overlay in January 2025. February 2025 net profit growth was driven by a sharp reduction in provision expenses to IDR 3.3 trillion, down 49 percent YoY and 41 percent MoM, reflected in the bank-only cost of credit (CoC) easing to 3.28 percent (vs. Jan 2025: 5.57 percent, Feb 2024: 6.72 percent). Operating profit (PPOP) fell 11 percent YoY in February 2025 because of a surge in labor costs (+91 percent YoY). Net interest margin (NIM) for the bank only remained stable at 6.39 percent in February 2025 (vs. Feb 2024: 6.17 percent, Jan 2025: 6.15 percent). Meanwhile, credit and financing growth for the bank only increased 5.2 percent YoY over the first two months of 2025 (vs. 2M24: +12.6 percent YoY, 1M25: +4.6 percent YoY), with the loan-to-deposit ratio staying high at 88.2 percent.",
