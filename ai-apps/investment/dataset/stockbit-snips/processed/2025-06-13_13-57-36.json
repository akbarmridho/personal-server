      "title": "Israel Attacks Iran, Oil and Gold Prices Surge",
      "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that the Israeli military has launched an attack on Iran, with targets including Iran's nuclear, military, and ballistic missile facilities. This military operation was carried out as a step by Israel to prevent Iran from further developing nuclear weapons. The attack killed the highest commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, as well as the chief of staff and a senior nuclear scientist. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said that Iran would retaliate against the Israeli attack. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that the US was not involved in this attack, even though the US already knew the attack would occur. Iran itself is the third largest producer in OPEC+ with production of ~3.3 million barrels per day or equivalent to ~3% of total global production, and sells almost all of its production to China. According to a New York Times report, China has large strategic oil reserves resulting from accumulated purchases over the last decade. This can help China withstand global oil supply disruptions for several weeks. Bloomberg reported that this conflict escalation also raised concerns about Iran's potential to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, which connects about 26% of total global oil trade. The strait is also vital for liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade, with more than one-fifth of global LNG supply passing through this strait. Following the Israeli attack on Iran, Brent crude futures for August 2025 contracts briefly surged up to +13.17% to the level of 78.5 US dollars per barrel on Friday (13/6), before its rise softened to +8.29% this afternoon. On the same day, spot market gold prices also rose up to +1.88% before softening to +1.15% to the level of 3,442 US dollars per troy ounce. Meanwhile, the stock market reacted negatively on Friday (13/6), with Nikkei (-0.92%), Hang Seng (-0.59%), and IHSG (-0.53%) closing weaker, while S&P 500 Futures fell -0.94%.",
