      "title": "Official Continuation of HGBT Incentive",
      "content": "The government officially continues the incentive for certain natural gas prices (HGBT) through the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree announced last week. Compared with the previous regulation, the extension of the HGBT incentive sets the plant-gate gas price from a range of USD 6-7 per MMBtu to USD 6.5-7 per MMBtu. The price will be applied retroactively from January 2025, with a validity period of five years. HGBT will again be granted to seven industrial sectors as in the previous regulation, namely ceramics, fertilizer, petrochemical, oleochemical, steel, glass, and rubber gloves.\n\nThe Chairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Industry Association (Asaki), Edy Suryanto, said that the extension of HGBT is needed to maintain and improve the competitiveness of the domestic ceramic industry, as well as to provide business certainty and a conducive investment climate. Edy explained that the HGBT incentive from 2020-2024 has driven the addition of new national ceramic tile production capacity of 90 million square meters, foreign direct investment of roughly IDR 20-23 trillion, and the absorption of about 15,000 workers.\n\nFollowing the continuation of the HGBT incentive, Edy explained that Asaki members will immediately add ceramic tile production capacity by 45 million square meters per year through an investment worth IDR 4 trillion, which is expected to absorb 5,000 new workers. The expansion is targeted to be completed at least by the second half of 2026.\n\nAlthough Asaki does not object to the increase in the HGBT tariff, Edy stated that they request the incentive to be fully implemented on the ground, with gas supply matching the industry needs listed in the Ministerial Decree.\n\nPreviously, Edy mentioned that Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) raised the surcharge for gas usage above the allocated industrial gas quota (AGIT) from USD 13.85 per MMBtu to USD 16.77 per MMBtu for the period 1 January-31 March 2025. Edy disclosed that if the surcharge is applied, the purpose of HGBT to improve manufacturing competitiveness and support economic growth will not be realized.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe believe that the continuation of the HGBT incentive will provide positive sentiment for issuers sensitive to gas prices, especially Arwana Citramulia (ARNA), because:\n- The extension ensures ARNA can continue to access gas at a lower price, considering energy costs contributed about 32% of the company's production cost in 2024.\n- The new price in the 2025 HGBT incentive applies retroactively from 1 January 2025, so ARNA will not have to pay market-higher gas prices during January-February 2025.\n- Based on our estimate, the increase in the HGBT tariff will raise ARNA's gas cost by only about +10%, while ARNA needs to increase its average selling price by about +2% to cover the higher gas cost, which we consider manageable, especially after the anti-dumping import duty (BMAD) regulation on ceramics.\n\nThe continuation of the HGBT incentive with a moderate price increase provides certainty and stability of production costs for ARNA. We see that with the ongoing HGBT incentive, ARNA will still be able to achieve double-digit growth in 2025 with net profit around IDR 500 billion (more than +17% YoY). With the projected double-digit net profit growth, ARNA is currently trading at a valuation of less than 10x FY25 P/E and a dividend yield of about 6-7%, which we consider attractive.",

      "title": "ITMG Targets 2025 Coal Sales Volume Up 10-14% YoY",
      "content": "- $ITMG: Indo Tambangraya Megah announced in an analyst meeting on Monday (3/3) that the company targets coal sales volume of about 26.3-27.4 million tons in 2025, higher by +9.6-14.2% YoY compared with the 2024 realization. Coal production volume for 2025 is targeted at 20.8-21.9 million tons (+3-8.4% YoY), with a stripping ratio target of 10-11x (vs. FY24: 10x). To achieve the target, ITMG allocates capex of about USD 50-65 million in 2025 (vs. 2024: USD 58 million).\n- $ASII: Astra International, through its subsidiary PT Astra Daihatsu Motor, started expanding its plant in Karawang with an investment value of IDR 2.9 trillion. The expansion will increase PT Astra Daihatsu Motor's production capacity by 140,000 units per year to a total of 530,000 units per year, aimed at domestic and global markets. The additional plant will produce LCGC models, namely Daihatsu Ayla and Toyota Agya.\n- $MYOR: Mayora Indah reported net profit of IDR 985 billion in 4Q24 (-16% YoY, +231% QoQ). This result made the 2024 net profit reach IDR 3 trillion (-6% YoY), roughly in line with expectations as it met 98% of consensus estimates. The result was supported by a revenue surge in 4Q24 to IDR 10.4 trillion (+21% YoY, +11% QoQ) driven by added capacity from a new plant, leading to 2024 revenue of IDR 36.1 trillion (+15% YoY). Gross profit margin in 4Q24 slightly improved quarter-on-quarter to 20.9% (vs. 4Q23: 26.7%, 3Q24: 20.5%) due to higher selling prices executed in October 2024 and a stronger US dollar exchange rate. Normalised opex after the opening of two new plants in 3Q24 also contributed to a quarterly operating profit recovery to IDR 1.18 trillion in 4Q24 (-22% YoY, +63% QoQ). MYOR also recorded a currency gain of IDR 233 billion in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: IDR 47 billion, 3Q24: loss of IDR 257 billion), as the US dollar strengthened against the rupiah. The opex normalisation after the two new plants also helped the quarterly operating profit recovery.\n- $TPIA: Chandra Asri Pacific, through its infrastructure subsidiary PT Chandra Daya Investasi, signed a term-loan facility worth IDR 2 trillion from Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN) with a 7-year tenor. The facility can be allocated to green-asset projects such as renewable energy, sustainable water and wastewater management, energy efficiency, and others.\n- $AVIA: Avia Avian plans a share buyback of up to 1.42 billion shares (2.3%) with a maximum fund allocation of IDR 1 trillion. The corporate action is scheduled to be carried out no later than 12 months after approval in the extraordinary general meeting to be held on 10 April 2025. This is the second buyback program by AVIA. Previously, the company announced a buyback of 1.42 billion (2.3%) shares since the end of 2023, with actualisation reaching 1.35 billion (2.2%) shares by January 2025.\n- $LABA: Green Power Group controller PT Nev Stored Energy purchased 3.95 million LABA shares at an average price of IDR 255 per share on 28 February 2025. The total transaction value was about IDR 1 billion. After this transaction, PT Nev Stored Energy's ownership in LABA increased from 50.75% to 51.11%.\n- $WIFI: Solusi Sinergi Digital announced a cooperation with Era Media Sejahtera (DOOH) to market the company's 'Internet Rakyat' service. In this undisclosed-value cooperation, DOOH will expand the marketing of 'Internet Rakyat' using key opinion leaders, programmatic advertising, social media communities, and events.\n- $KPIG: MNC Land controller MNC Asia Holding (BHIT) purchased 15 million KPIG shares at an average price of IDR 137 per share on 7, 24, and 25 February 2025. The total transaction value was about IDR 2.1 billion. After this transaction, BHIT's ownership in KPIG rose from 21.33% to 21.35%.\n- $TOSK: Topindo Solusi Komunika shareholder Robi Cahyadi bought 107.5 million TOSK shares at IDR 50 per share on 24-25 February 2025. The total transaction value was about IDR 5.4 billion. After this transaction, Robi's ownership in TOSK increased from 3.87% to 6.33%.\n- BPS reported that the Indonesian consumer price index (CPI) recorded a deflation of 0.09% YoY in February 2025 (vs. Jan 2025: inflation 0.76% YoY), contrary to consensus expectations of 0.41% YoY, marking the first annual deflation since March 2000. The result was driven by a 50% electricity tariff discount since January 2025, with electricity contributing a deflationary effect of 2.16 percentage points. Monthly, Indonesia experienced a deflation of 0.48% MoM (vs. Jan 2025: deflation 0.76% MoM), beyond consensus expectations of 0.02% MoM, marking the second consecutive monthly deflation. Meanwhile, core inflation rose to a 20-month high of 2.48% YoY (vs. Jan 2025: 2.36% YoY), surpassing consensus of 2.45% YoY.\n- The Deputy Commissioner of Capital Market Supervision and Securities Agency OJK, Aditya Jayaantara, said on Monday (3/3) that OJK and IDX agreed to postpone the implementation of short-selling and to study a policy allowing issuers to conduct share buybacks without shareholder meeting approval. The steps aim to reduce pressure on the IDX, which fell -3.31% on Friday (28/2) and has weakened -7.91% YTD as of Monday (3/3). Previously, IDX planned to launch the first phase of short-selling in March 2025.\n- US President Donald Trump said on Sunday (2/3) that five cryptocurrencies will be included in the US strategic reserve: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano.\n- S&P Global reported that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.6 in February 2025 (vs. Jan 2025: 51.9), indicating three consecutive months of factory expansion and the fastest pace since March 2024. The result was driven by the highest new-order growth in almost a year, alongside increased output, purchases, and employment.\n- S&P Global reported that China's manufacturing PMI rose to 50.8 in February 2025 (vs. Jan 2025: 50.1), exceeding consensus of 50.3. The result marked the highest increase since November 2024, with output and new orders growing at the strongest rate in three months as market conditions improved.\n- The government officially set the Coal Reference Price (HBA) as the export price reference per 1 March 2025, based on the latest Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree. The Indonesian Coal Mining Association's Acting Executive Director Gita Mahyarani said the regulation states that export coal prices below the Coal Benchmark Price (HPB) will be rejected in the state revenue system and will not receive export permits.\n- Kontan reported that the Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) 2025 held on 13-23 February 2025 at JIExpo, Kemayoran recorded total transactions of IDR 8 trillion (+19% YoY) with visitor numbers up 3% YoY to 579,337 people. Vehicle sales at the event reached 22,322 units (+16.3% YoY), with the possibility of further increase as some brand recaps are still ongoing. However, electric motorcycle sales at the show fell -21% YoY due to fewer participants in that category and the lack of electric-motorcycle stimulus policies during the exhibition period.\n- Sri Rejeki Isman (SRIL) stated that the company is negotiating with potential investors to lease its assets. The move aims to improve the value of the bankrupt assets and prevent further devaluation, creating opportunities for about 10,000 SRIL workers to be rehired. SRIL has communicated with several investors and will decide within two weeks who will lease the assets. Previously, SRIL halted operations on 1 March 2025 after losing its bankruptcy appeal.\n- Delta Dunia Makmur (DOID) announced a name change to BUMA International Group. DOID's President Director Ronald Sutardja said the name change strengthens the reputation of the subsidiary PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama as a leading mining contractor in Indonesia and abroad.",
