Key Takeaway: The share buyback action above can indicate the confidence of Prajogo Pangestu's issuers in the fundamental or value of each company. Although this purchase can foster optimism among some market participants and provide support for the IHSG, we assess that an increase in investor confidence - especially foreign investors - is needed for a more significant IHSG recovery.",

However, Misbakhun did not detail how the role of Bank Indonesia can be enhanced, and no decision has been made yet. The DPR is currently discussing Law No. 4/2023 concerning the development and strengthening of the financial sector, which raises concerns that the revision of these rules will weaken the independence of Bank Indonesia. Previously, Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, acknowledged that there were discussions about the central bank's mandate in parliamentary discussions, but he expects no change regarding this matter. Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Thursday (20/3) that the government plans to increase nickel and gold royalties by about +1.5-3 percentage points, although he did not provide further details. Previously, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources held a public consultation earlier this month regarding the draft amendment of royalties for minerals and coal (minerba). CEO of BPI Danantara and Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Rosan Roeslani, stated on Friday (21/3) that the complete structure of the management filling important positions in Danantara will be announced on Monday afternoon (24/3), although he did not provide further details. Previously, President Prabowo Subianto announced the leadership of Danantara at the end of February 2025, along with the launch of the body.",

This result caused the net profit of the bank only for 2M25 to drop -18% YoY to 6.6 trillion rupiah, worse than the 2025F consolidated estimate from the consensus (-1.3% YoY), caused by management overlay in January 2025. The net profit growth in February 2025 was driven by a significant decrease in provisioning costs to 3.3 trillion rupiah (-49% YoY, -41% MoM), which was reflected in the bank only's cost of credit (CoC) which flattened to 3.28% (vs. Jan 2025: 5.57%, Feb 2024: 6.72%). Operationally, PPOP dropped -11% YoY in February 2025 due to surging labor expenses (+91% YoY). Meanwhile, the bank only's Net Interest Margin (NIM) remained stable at 6.39% in February 2025 (vs. Feb 2024: 6.17%, Jan 2025: 6.15%). On the other hand, the growth of credit and financing for the bank only grew +5.2% YoY during 2M25 (vs. 2M24: +12.6% YoY, 1M25: +4.6% YoY), with the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) remaining high at 88.2%.",
