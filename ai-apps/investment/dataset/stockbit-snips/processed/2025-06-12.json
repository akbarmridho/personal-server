      "title": "China Likely to Cut Low-Grade Coal Imports",
      "content": "Bloomberg reported that China is likely to cut imports of low-grade coal, a development that could create negative sentiment for exporters such as Indonesia. The outlook is based on a surplus of coal supply in China and the Chinese government’s effort to tighten carbon emissions. China Huadian Corp., one of the largest power generators in China, forecasts total coal imports to be only about 400 million tonnes in 2025, far below the record 543 million tonnes in 2024. This projection is even lower than the estimate from the China Coal Transportation and Distribution Association earlier this year, which projected 2025 imports at about 525 million tonnes. Analyst Li Xuegang of the Association said that thermal coal imports have fallen for three consecutive months as of May 2025 and he expects the downward trend to accelerate for the rest of the year. Previously, commodity-analysis firm Kpler recorded that thermal coal imports to Asia reached 74.12 million tonnes in May 2025, up +8.1 % month-on-month (MoM) while still down -5.3 % year-on-year (YoY). This marked the highest monthly Asian thermal-coal import volume in the past five months, amid weakening Indonesian and Australian coal prices to a four-year low due to higher domestic supply in China and India. Cumulatively over the first five months of 2025, Asian thermal-coal imports fell 7 % YoY to 346.96 million tonnes, according to Kpler data.",

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4 % YoY in May 2025 (vs. 2.3 % in April), slightly below the 2.5 % consensus, while month-on-month inflation was 0.1 % (vs. 0.2 % in April). Core CPI remained at 2.8 % YoY, unchanged for three months. Bloomberg reported that President Prabowo Subianto will visit Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia on 18-20 June 2025, missing the G-7 summit in Canada; the foreign ministry said the trip had been planned before the G-7 invitation. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India noted that Indian CPO imports rose 84 % MoM in May 2025 to 592,888 tonnes, the highest monthly level since November 2024, though still below the historical average of over 750,000 tonnes per month for the marketing year ending October 2024. GGN Research expects Indian CPO imports to rise to about 850,000 tonnes in June 2025, driven by cheaper CPO prices versus soy oil. Reuters said traders expect Indian vegetable-oil imports to increase in the coming months, supported by a tariff cut on vegetable-oil imports in India this month.",
