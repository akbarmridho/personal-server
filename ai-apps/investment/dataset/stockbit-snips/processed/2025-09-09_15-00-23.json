      "content": "1. The rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakened by -1.05% to the level of 16,475 on Tuesday (9/9), following President Prabowo Subianto's decision to replace the Finance Minister from Sri Mulyani to Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa. The Head of the Monetary Management and Asset Securities Department of Bank Indonesia, Erwin Hutapea, stated on Tuesday (9/9) that Bank Indonesia has intervened in the foreign exchange market to ensure the rupiah exchange rate moves in accordance with its fundamentals. 2. The Directorate General of Financing and Risk Management of the Ministry of Finance held a government bond (SUN) auction on Tuesday (9/9), with incoming bids amounting to 79.55 trillion rupiah. The Ministry of Finance noted that the total nominal winning bids from the auction were 24.45 trillion rupiah, below the indicative auction target of 27 trillion rupiah. One of the offered SUNs was FR0108 (maturing April 15, 2036) with a weighted average yield won at 6.45% and a winning nominal amount of 3.5 trillion rupiah. Meanwhile, the bid for SPN12260910 (maturing September 10, 2026) was won with a weighted average yield of 5.15% and a winning nominal amount of 5.1 trillion rupiah. 3. The Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated on Tuesday (9/9) that the government will maintain the State Budget deficit below 3% of GDP, in accordance with regulatory provisions. Purbaya also mentioned that his office will cooperate with Bank Indonesia to ease liquidity in the financial markets to open up funding for economic activities and government programs. 4. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated that the government will strengthen economic stimulus in the second semester of this year. Airlangga mentioned that several ongoing programs will continue to be expanded, including salary subsidies for workers earning below 10 million rupiah, labor-intensive programs, income tax exemptions for certain sectors, and housing support. However, Airlangga did not elaborate further on the details, period, or magnitude of the stimulus to be provided. 5. Gold prices in the spot market strengthened by +0.48% to 3,654 US dollars per troy ounce on Tuesday (9/9) afternoon and briefly recorded an intraday all-time high at 3,659.4 US dollars per troy ounce, continuing the strengthening of +1.4% on Monday (8/9). The rise in gold prices occurred amid expectations of a Fed interest rate cut next week. Besides gold, the three US stock indices also strengthened, with the Nasdaq closing at a new all-time high on Monday (8/9). 6. The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) noted that domestic motorcycle sales in August 2025 reached 578,041 units (+0.7% YoY, -1.5% MoM). This result brought combined domestic motorcycle sales for 8M25 to approximately 4.3 million units (-1.7% YoY), equivalent to 64-67% of AISI's 2025 target in the range of 6.4-6.7 million units (compared to 8M24: 69% realization in 2024). 7. Brent crude oil prices in the spot market strengthened slightly by +0.4% to 66.5 US dollars per barrel on Tuesday (9/9) afternoon. This oil price movement was supported by expectations of continued oil hoarding by China and concerns over supply tightening from Russia following potential new sanctions, which could offset OPEC+'s decision to increase production by 137 thousand barrels per day starting October 2025. This OPEC+ production increase, agreed upon last weekend, was also lower than the production increases in the preceding 4 months, which reached 550 thousand barrels in September and August and 411 thousand barrels in July and June 2025. 8. VP of Corporate Communications for Freeport Indonesia, Katri Krisnati, stated on Tuesday (9/9) that the company will temporarily halt mining activities at the Grasberg mine, Central Papua, to prioritize the safe evacuation of 7 contractor workers still trapped in the landslide-affected area. Katri explained that the landslide incident occurred on Monday (8/9) around 22.00 WIT.",

      "title": "MDKA Subsidiary, EMAS, Plans IPO with Valuation of IDR 29-49 Trillion",
      "content": "Merdeka Gold Resources (EMAS), a subsidiary of Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA), plans an IPO by offering up to 1.6 billion (10%) new shares at a price range of 1,800-3,020 rupiah per share. This amount implies a target fundraising of approximately 2.9-4.9 trillion rupiah, with a market capitalization around 29-49 trillion rupiah. Funds obtained from the IPO will be used by EMAS for: 1) 328.4 billion rupiah as phased capital injection into PT Pani Bersama Tambang; 2) 328.4 billion rupiah as a loan to PT Puncak Emas Tani Sejahtera; and 3) the remainder for early debt repayment to MDKA. EMAS is an MDKA subsidiary planning to develop the Pani gold project in Gorontalo, with a total mining area of 14,670 hectares. As of 2024, the Pani gold project is projected to have mineral resources of 292.4 million tons of ore containing 7 million troy ounces of gold at a grade of 0.75 grams per ton and reserves of 77.5 million tons of ore containing 1.9 million troy ounces of gold at a grade of 0.78 grams per ton. The mine life is estimated until 2041, with peak gold production in 2033 projected to reach 500 thousand troy ounces per year. Currently, the company has not commenced commercial operational activities as it is still completing the construction of processing facilities using the heap leach method. The progress of this construction reached 67% as of June 30, 2025, with mechanical completion projected for November 2025 and the commissioning stage in December 2025. Moving forward, EMAS plans to build 2 processing capacities, namely: 1. Year 2025-2026: Heap leach facility with a capacity of 7 million tons per year and a target gold production of 145 thousand troy ounces per year. 2. Year 2027-2029: Carbon-in-leach (CIL) facility with a capacity of 7.5 million tons per year and a target gold production of 355 thousand troy ounces per year. 3. Year 2029-2032: CIL facility upgrade from 7.5 million tons per year to 12 million tons per year, with the target gold production increasing from 355 thousand troy ounces per year to 500 thousand troy ounces per year. 4. The combination of both facilities (heap leach and CIL) will reach 19 million tons per year with a gold production potential of up to 500 thousand troy ounces per year by 2033. Shareholder Structure: After the IPO, EMAS shareholders will consist of MDKA (56.5%), treasury shares (9%), and the public (34.5%). This public ownership includes 10% public ownership from the new share issuance, 8.36% ownership by Winato Kartono, 5.6% ownership by Garibaldi Thohir, and several other individual holdings. Valuation: After the IPO, EMAS will have a P/BV valuation of approximately 4-5.3x based on the financial statement as of 1Q25 (TTM). Valuation based on P/E could not be conducted because the company has recorded a net loss for the last 3 years. Financial Performance: In 2024, EMAS recorded revenue of 1.7 million US dollars with a net loss of 12.7 million US dollars. As of 1Q25, EMAS recorded no revenue and a net loss of 9.2 million US dollars. As of 1Q25, the company's operational business segment that is running is mining support services, while the mining and processing segments have not yet operated. The absence of revenue in 1Q25 was due to the acquisition of PT Puncak Emas Tani Sejahtera from 48.99% ownership to 99.99%, so that all revenue from the mining support segment was fully eliminated. Key Takeaway: From a valuation perspective among pure gold miners (see table above), EMAS is traded at the highest premium based on EV/Reserves, but not too premium when viewed based on EV/Resources. We assess that the execution and development of the Pani gold project will be a factor for investors to watch as the company's processing facilities are not yet operational. Referring to the group's track record, MDKA also had not commenced production when it IPO'd in June 2015, at which time the company committed to completing the construction of the Tujuh Bukit mine infrastructure over 20 months from the IPO (June 2015-February 2017). MDKA itself began production in 2Q17.",

      "title": "SSIA Revises 2025 Net Profit Target to -14% YoY, Opens Opportunity for Corporate Action",
      "content": "1. Surya Semesta Internusa (SSIA): VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications Erlin Budiman stated that the company projects revenues and net profits for 2025 to fall by approximately -4% YoY and -14% YoY, respectively, lower than the initial target which aimed for +5% YoY and +20% YoY. Erlin stated that the projection of performance decline is based on the backlog of Sabang Smartpolitan land sales which will only be recognized in early 2026 and the potential decline in hospitality segment occupancy following government budget efficiency. Meanwhile, SSIA President Director, Johannes Suriadjaja, stated that the company is committed to distributing a dividend payout ratio of around 30% and mentioned that SSIA is in the process of significant land bank addition with land clearing up to 100 hectares as of June 2025. Johannes also mentioned that the company is exploring a number of corporate action options or collaboration opportunities with other parties to boost the long-term development of Subang Smartpolitan. 2. Gaikindo reported that combined wholesale sales for Toyota and Daihatsu reached 28,174 units in August 2025 (-29% YoY, -4% MoM). This realization brought their combined wholesale sales to 245,781 units during 8M25 (-17% YoY). 3. J Resources Asia Pasifik (PSAB) stated in a clarification to the IDX that rumors regarding United Tractors (UNTR)'s plan to acquire PSAB's mining assets did not originate from the company. However, PSAB explained that the company is always open to considering strategic transactions and corporate actions that can provide benefits and added value to the company's performance going forward. In a separate information disclosure, UNTR also stated it was unaware of the source of the rumor, but the company is indeed seeking new opportunities for mineral acquisitions. Previously, Bloomberg Technoz reported on September 4, 2025, that UNTR planned to acquire mining assets belonging to PSAB in Indonesia. 4. Remala Abadi (DATA) President Director, Abadi Agus Setiono, stated that the company plans to acquire an internet service provider (ISP) company this year to cover the shortage of homepasses currently held by the company. According to the Bisnis report, DATA currently has 317,000 homepasses, while the company targets to build 500,000 homepasses by the end of 2025. To develop these homepasses, DATA will allocate capex up to 500 billion rupiah, sourced from internal company funds, investors, and bank loans. Agus also mentioned that the Djarum group will continue to purchase DATA shares, but he did not provide further details. 5. Jasa Armada Indonesia (IPCM) Director, Dessy Emastari Prihatiningtyas, stated that the company will budget 148 billion rupiah until 2026 for the addition of 2 tugboats, with 80 billion rupiah of that amount to be absorbed this year. IPCM President Director, Shanti Puruhita, said that the 2 new vessels are projected to be operational next year. In addition to vessel additions, Shanti mentioned that IPCM is expanding specialized terminal services, particularly in Eastern Indonesia. In line with the ongoing expansion, IPCM targets revenue and net profit growth of +5% YoY in 2025.",
