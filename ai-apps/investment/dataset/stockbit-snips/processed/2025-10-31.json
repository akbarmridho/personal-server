      "title": "Perbaikan ARPU Segmen 'Mobile' Topang Pendapatan pada 3Q25",
      "content": "Operationally, the mobile segment remains the main contributor with revenues of 59 trillion rupiah during 9M25 (-6% YoY). Although annually declining, mobile segment revenue showed quarterly improvement in 3Q25 (-2% YoY, +5% QoQ) along with the growth of average revenue per user (ARPU) to 43,400 rupiah (+0.7% YoY, +5.3% QoQ), marking the first quarterly growth and the highest level throughout 2025. This ARPU increase was followed by a relatively stable subscriber base at 157.5 million (-0.5% YoY, -0.6% QoQ), indicating that price competition in the industry is starting to improve. Meanwhile, the consumer segment revenue during 9M25 increased slightly by +1% YoY to 19.7 trillion rupiah. Quarterly, the consumer segment revenue weakened in 3Q25 (-2% YoY, -2% QoQ) due to a drop in IndiHome ARPU to 209,800 rupiah (-10.6% YoY, -3.3% QoQ), marking the lowest level since 2024. Management explained this weakening was caused by a shift in customer preference from triple play (3P) packages to internet-only (1P) as well as expansion into non-Java areas with lower purchasing power. Revenue performance from other business segments was also pressured in 3Q25 - namely, the enterprise segment (-3% YoY, -3% QoQ) and wholesales and international business (+8% YoY, -8% QoQ) - which contributed to TLKM's relatively flat revenue in 3Q25 (-1% YoY, +1% QoQ). Looking at the 9M25 revenue realization which reached only 73% of the consensus 2025F estimate at 149.6 trillion rupiah (vs. 9M24: 75% annual realization), we assess that this consensus estimate remains achievable, considering there are several positive catalysts for TLKM's performance, one of which is the increase in mobile segment ARPU followed by a stable subscriber base.",

The first stage covers 56% of the company's fiber assets, expected to be completed after the GMER on December 12, 2025, while phase 2 covers the remaining 44% of fiber assets to be carried out in 1H26, followed by opening opportunities for strategic partnerships in 2H26. TLKM management explained that this spin-off is an effort to change the company's position from an operational holding to a pure strategic holding, which is expected to improve operational efficiency while opening strategic partnership opportunities for TIF in the future. TLKM management will also continue to simplify subsidiaries as part of the value-unlocking dividend agenda.

However, performance in 3Q25 is beginning to show indications of ARPU recovery in the industry, where TLKM management is optimistic this momentum can continue into the next quarter and become a positive catalyst for performance improvement in 4Q25. In addition, the ongoing restructuring initiatives for fiber assets and subsidiary streamlining can provide positive signals and a foundation for future performance recovery.",

      "content": "Telkom Indonesia (TLKM) recorded a net profit of 4.8 trillion rupiah in 3Q25 (-19% YoY, -7% QoQ).

Operating profit during 9M25 decreased by -9% YoY as operating profit margin shrank to 26.7% (vs. 9M24: 28.9%) due to a decline in revenue (-2% YoY) amid an increase in cost of revenue (+3% YoY), although opex decreased by -6% YoY. Following the weak performance in 9M25, TLKM management revised down the 2025 revenue guidance from flat to slightly contracting. This marks the second downward revision of the 2025 revenue guidance, after management revised the revenue guidance from low single-digit growth to flat in 1H25. We assess the consensus revenue estimate of 149.6 trillion rupiah for 2025F, based on 9M25 realization of only 73% (vs. 9M24: 75% annual realization), to still be achievable, considering positive catalysts such as the increase in mobile segment ARPU accompanied by a stable subscriber base.",
