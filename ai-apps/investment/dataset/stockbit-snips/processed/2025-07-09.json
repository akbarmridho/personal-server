      "title": "Automobile Sales June 2025 Worsen",
      "content": "Gaikindo recorded that wholesale automobile sales in June 2025 reached only 57,760 units, a decline of 23 percent year-on-year and 5 percent month-on-month. This is the lowest monthly sales figure for the year, excluding April 2025 which was affected by the Lebaran holiday. The realization brings total sales for the first half of 2025 to 374,741 units, down 9 percent YoY, representing only 42-50 percent of Gaikindo's 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 (compared with 47 percent realization in the first half of 2024). Japanese brands in general continued to record weak sales, both for Astra International's brand ($ASII) and other Japanese brands. Among Japanese brands, only Suzuki posted a positive annual sales growth in June 2025. Chinese brands – except Wuling – kept showing positive momentum in June 2025, especially Chery which recorded monthly sales above 2,000 units for the first time. In June 2025, BYD (including Denza) and Chery became the 6th and 7th highest-selling brands, moving up from 9th and 10th positions in December 2024. With the June 2025 realization, the combined market share of Astra International's two flagship brands, Toyota and Daihatsu, reached only 50.2 percent in the first half of 2025 (versus 52.5 percent in the first half of 2024). Honda suffered the largest market-share decline in the first half of 2025, falling to 8.7 percent (versus 11.6 percent in the first half of 2024). Meanwhile, BYD (including Denza) and Chery each held market shares of 5.3 percent (versus 0.4 percent in the first half of 2024) and 2.7 percent (versus 1.0 percent in the first half of 2024). Gaikindo Chairman Yohannes Nangoi said on June 2025 that the association, together with the government, is discussing new breakthroughs to boost automobile sales in Indonesia. He mentioned that the breakthroughs could take the form of fiscal incentives or tax reforms, which will be announced once an agreement is reached. Key Takeaway: Although market expectations for the automotive sector appear low, we assess that the further deterioration of car sales over the past two months makes the recovery potential for automotive stocks such as $ASII, $AUTO, and $DRMA unlikely to materialize unless the government launches significant incentives. At the same time, strong BYD sales are a driver of volume throughput for completely built-up car handling for $IPCC, which in the first five months of 2025 reached 348,500 units, up 9 percent YoY.",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday (July 8) that the United States will impose a 50 percent tariff on copper imports and will soon impose tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Trump also repeated his threat to levy a 10 percent tariff on products from BRICS member countries. He emphasized that there will be no changes to the August 1, 2025 tariff implementation deadline. The statement came after he had previously said the August 1 deadline was not 100 percent certain. Trump added that trade negotiations with the European Union and China were proceeding well, but he will send a tariff determination letter to the EU in the coming days. 2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told Reuters on Tuesday (July 8) that PT Pertamina has signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase LPG, gasoline, and crude oil from the United States. He also mentioned that FKS Group and Sorini Agro Asia Corporindo have signed a corn purchase agreement with Cargill. On the same day, Deputy Energy Minister Yuliot Tanjung told national media that the decision to import energy from the United States will be postponed until final negotiations are concluded. Previously, the government offered a $34 billion package for investment and import of US goods as part of the tariff negotiations, covering $15.5 billion of energy purchases and agricultural goods. 3. Deputy Energy Minister Yuliot Tanjung said the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is opening a direct appointment option for the management of oil and gas work areas, which are currently handled through auctions or tenders. He explained that the direct appointment concept is an effort to simplify the process and will be driven by amendments to Law No. 22/2001. 4. Deputy Energy Minister Yuliot Tanjung also said the ministry is still discussing regulations related to export duties on coal and gold. He noted that the ministry is considering gold and coal prices as well as international market competitiveness, and will hold a meeting with the Ministry of Finance on the export duty decisions for both commodities. The statement followed the government's and DPR's opening of the possibility to impose export duties on coal and gold starting in 2026. 5. Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara has appointed DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc, Natixis SA, and Standard Chartered Plc as coordinators for a multicurrency loan facility of up to $10 billion. Earlier Bloomberg coverage indicated that the loan facility has a tenor of three to five years and is intended for general corporate purposes. The loan is unsecured and will not be backed by any guarantee or government support letter. 6. Bank Indonesia estimates that retail sales in June 2025 will grow +2 percent YoY and +0.5 percent MoM. In May 2025, retail sales grew +1.9 percent YoY and -1.3 percent MoM (versus April 2025: -0.3 percent YoY, -5.1 percent MoM), lower than Bank Indonesia's forecast of +2.6 percent YoY and -0.6 percent MoM. The annual retail sales growth in May 2025 was supported by sustained demand due to the joint holiday of Vesak and the rise of Jesus Christ.",
