      "content": "EMAS is a subsidiary of Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA) and Merdeka Gold Resources (EMAS) planning an IPO offering up to 1.6 billion (10%) new shares at a price range of IDR 1,800-3,020 per share. This implies target proceeds of roughly IDR 2.9-4.9 trillion, with a market capitalisation of about IDR 29-49 trillion.\n\nThe proceeds will be used by EMAS for: (1) a capital contribution of IDR 328.4 billion to PT Pani Bersama Tambang; (2) a loan of IDR 328.4 billion to PT Puncak Emas Tani Sejahtera; and (3) the remaining amount to repay debt to MDKA.\n\nEMAS, the MDKA subsidiary, plans to develop the Pani gold project in Gorontalo, covering a mining area of 14,670 ha. As of 2024 the Pani project is estimated to contain 292.4 million tonnes of ore with 7 million troy ounces of gold at a grade of 0.75 g/t and reserves of 77.5 million tonnes with 1.9 million troy ounces at 0.78 g/t. The mine life is projected to 2041, with peak gold production in 2033 expected at 500 thousand troy ounces per year.\n\nThe company has not yet commenced commercial operations as it is completing a heap-leach processing plant, which is 67 % complete as of 30 June 2025, with mechanical completion projected for November 2025 and commissioning in December 2025.\n\nFuture processing capacity plans:\n1. 2025-2026: heap-leach plant, 7 Mt/yr, gold output 145 k oz/yr.\n2. 2027-2029: carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant, 7.5 Mt/yr, gold output 355 k oz/yr.\n3. 2029-2032: upgrade CIL to 12 Mt/yr, gold output 500 k oz/yr.\n4. Combined heap-leach and CIL capacity of 19 Mt/yr, gold output up to 500 k oz/yr by 2033.\n\nShareholding after the IPO: MDKA 56.5 %, treasury 9 %, public 34.5 % (including 10 % from the new issue, 8.36 % held by Winato Kartono, 5.6 % held by Garibaldi Thohir, and other individual shareholders.\n\nValuation: post-IPO P/BV is expected at 4-5.3× based on 1Q25 (TTM) financials. A P/E multiple cannot be calculated as the company has posted net losses for three consecutive years.\n\nFinancial performance: 2024 revenue US$1.7 million, net loss US$12.7 million. In 1Q25, no revenue and a net loss of US$9.2 million. Up to 1Q25, the only operating segment is mining-service; the mining and processing segment is not yet operating. The lack of 1Q25 revenue is due to the acquisition of PT Puncak Emas Tani Sejahtera, increasing ownership from 48.99 % to 99.99 %, fully eliminating mining-service revenue.",

The downgrade is based on the backlog of the Sabang Smartpolitan land sales that will only be recognised in early 2026 and a potential occupancy decline in the hospitality segment due to government budget tightening. CEO Johannes Suriadjaja said the company remains committed to a roughly 30 % dividend payout ratio and is adding about 100 ha of landbank by June 2025. He also said SSIA is reviewing corporate-action options and collaboration opportunities to accelerate Subang Smartpolitan development.",
