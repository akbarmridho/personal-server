      "title": "The Fed Lowers Interest Rate Cut Expectations",
      "content": "The US central statistics bureau on Wednesday (12/6) reported that inflation eased again in May 2024 and was below expectations. Here are the details: MoM Inflation: 0.0% (vs. consensus: 0.1%; April 2024: 0.3%) YoY Inflation: 3.3% (vs. consensus: 3.4%; April 2024: 3.4%) Core MoM Inflation: 0.2% (vs. consensus: 0.3%; April 2024: 0.3%) Core YoY Inflation: 3.4% (vs. consensus: 3.5%; April 2024: 3.6%) Meanwhile, in a meeting that took place a few hours after the inflation data release, The Fed decided to maintain the interest rate at the level of 5.25-5.5%, in line with consensus expectations. The Fed also released the latest dot plot projection which indicates that interest rate cuts in 2024 will only occur by 25 bps or only 1 time, less than the previous projection which reached 75 bps or 3 times. According to The Fed, so far only modest progress has been seen towards achieving the inflation target of 2%. The developments above increased market participants' expectations for an interest rate cut in September 2024. According to analysis from CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of The Fed starting an interest rate cut in September 2024 rose to 62.4% from 52.8% before the inflation data release and the Fed meeting announcement. Following the release of inflation and the Fed meeting, here is the market data in the US on Wednesday (12/6): US dollar index (DXY) fell -0.59%. US stock exchanges generally reacted positively: S&P +0.85%, Nasdaq +1.53%, and DJIA -0.09%. 10-year US government bond yield fell -10 bps. Meanwhile, here is the market reaction in Indonesia on Thursday (13/6): The Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar closed stronger by +0.06% to the level of 16,286. IHSG fell by -0.27% to the level of 6,831. 10-year Indonesian government bond yield rose +6 bps to 7.08%.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "The weak reaction in the Rupiah exchange rate, government bond yields, and IHSG in today's trading indicates that foreign investor interest in Indonesia has not returned. For Indonesia itself, we assess that Bank Indonesia can only start cutting interest rates if the Rupiah exchange rate strengthens convincingly. The consensus expects Bank Indonesia to start cutting interest rates in 4Q24. To mitigate volatility risk from interest rate uncertainty, investors can take advantage of opportunities to lock in high and attractive yields on FR bonds, especially short-term series such as FR0081 and PBS032. On the other hand, SBR013 can be used to mitigate high-interest rate risk because it has a floating with floor coupon. From the stock market, with valuations reaching cheap levels, this momentum can be utilized to accumulate quality stocks such as the Big 4 Banks, TLKM, and ASII.",

Responding to this, the Director of Digital Economy from the Center of Economics and Law Studies, Nailul Huda, said that the target is unfounded given the uncertain global conditions.
