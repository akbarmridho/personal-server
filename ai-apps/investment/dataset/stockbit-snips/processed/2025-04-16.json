      "title": "Government Officially Changes Minerba Royalty Rates",
      "content": "The Government officially raised royalty rates for a number of mineral commodities – such as nickel, copper, and gold – through Government Regulation No. 19/2025. In addition, the government also adjusted royalties for coal producers operating under a Special Mining Business License (IUPK) through Government Regulation No. 18/2025.\n\nBoth regulations are largely the same as the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) in early March 2025 – which we previously summarized in Stockbit Commentary – where most mineral commodities receive higher royalty rates, while coal producers with IUPK licences see lower rates.\n\nHowever, the final increase in royalty rates for ferronickel and nickel matte is lower than the earlier proposal. Previously, the Ministry of ESDM proposed ferronickel royalties of 5-7 percent and nickel matte royalties of 4.5-6.5 percent. In the final regulation, ferronickel royalties range from 4-6 percent, while nickel matte royalties are about 3.5-5.5 percent.\n\nThere is still no information regarding royalty taxes for coal issuers operating under the Coal Mining Contract Agreement (PKP2B) and regular IUP.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that the change in royalty rates could put pressure on the performance of mineral producers such as Vale Indonesia (INCO), Trimegah Bangun Persada (NCKL), Aneka Tambang (ANTM), Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS), and Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN). Conversely, the royalty change could improve the performance of coal producers with IUPK contracts – such as Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI), Bumi Resources (BUMI), and Indika Energy (INDY). For illustration, the Coal Benchmark Price (HBA) in March 2025 was at USD 128 per ton, so the royalty rate for the three issuers could fall from 28 percent to 19 percent.\n\nIn a previous Stockbit Commentary we attempted to calculate the potential impact of the royalty change on net profit for AADI, BUMI, and INDY. Based on our analysis, BUMI would be the most benefited issuer with a potential net profit increase in 2025 of +142 percent year-on-year, followed by INDY (+126 percent YoY) and AADI (+21.9 percent YoY), assuming a main assumption of the average Newcastle coal price at USD 110 per ton.\n\nThis article was previously published in Stockbit Commentary on Wednesday (16 April) morning.\n\n*On Tuesday (15 April), Stockbit Snips reported in a table that Mitsubishi recorded sales of 5,769 units (-32 percent YoY, -34 percent MoM) in March 2025 and 21,692 units (-16 percent YoY) over 3M25. The information was incorrect because it did not include Mitsubishi Fuso sales. The correct information is that total Mitsubishi (Motors + Fuso) sales were 7,373 units (-13 percent YoY, -16 percent MoM) in March 2025, making 3M25 sales 23,296 units (-9.4 percent YoY).

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump again asked the Chinese government to start negotiations to resolve the escalating trade war. In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lin Jian, said that if the US truly wants to solve the problem through dialogue and negotiation, the US must stop using maximum pressure and \"stop threats and blackmail.\"\n\n2. The National Bureau of Statistics of China reported that China's economic growth reached +5.4 percent year-on-year in 1Q25 (versus +5.4 percent YoY in 4Q24), beating the consensus expectation of +5.1 percent YoY and marking the strongest annual growth since 3Q23. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in March 2025 fell to 5.2 percent (versus 5.4 percent in February 2025), better than the consensus expectation of 5.3 percent. In other data, retail sales in China grew +5.9 percent YoY in March 2025 (versus +4.0 percent YoY in the first two months of 2025), surpassing the consensus expectation of +4.2 percent YoY.\n\n3. Bank Indonesia estimated that Indonesian retail sales grew +0.5 percent YoY and +8.3 percent month-on-month in March 2025. Retail sales in February 2025 were recorded at +2.0 percent YoY and +3.3 percent MoM (versus +0.5 percent YoY and -4.7 percent MoM in January 2024), beating the Bank Indonesia forecast of -0.5 percent YoY and +0.8 percent MoM.\n\n4. Bank Indonesia reported that the Indonesian Consumer Confidence Index fell to 121.1 in March 2025 (versus 126.4 in February 2025), marking a decline for the third consecutive month although it remained in an optimistic range. The decline was driven by lower scores across all sub-indices.\n\n5. Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said on Tuesday (15 April) that the Indonesian government proposes to increase imports of oil and LPG from the United States by about USD 10 billion as part of a negotiation proposal to avoid a 32 percent US tariff. In 2024, the United States contributed about 57 percent of total Indonesian LPG imports, which amount to 217,000 barrels per day, and supplied about 4.2 percent of total Indonesian oil imports, which amount to 306,000 barrels per day.\n\n6. Shareholders of Japfa Ltd. (SGX: UD2) on Tuesday accepted a go-private plan, with an expected delisting date from the Singapore exchange on 3 June 2025. Japfa Ltd. is the controlling shareholder of Japfa Comfeed Indonesia (JPFA).\n\n7. Ecocare Indo Pacific (HYGN) plans to conduct a share buyback with a funding allocation of up to IDR 5 billion from 15 April to 15 July 2025, although the company does not disclose the maximum number of shares to be repurchased. This plan does not require shareholder meeting approval, following a relaxation granted by OJK to support market stability.\n\n8. The controlling shareholder of Hillcon (HILL), PT Hillcon Equity Management, sold 10 million HILL shares at IDR 320 per share on 11 April 2025. The total transaction value was IDR 3.2 billion.
