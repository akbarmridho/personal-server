      "title": "Prospective Ministers Summoned, Sri Mulyani Again Asked to Serve as Finance Minister",
      "content": "President-elect Prabowo Subianto, on Monday (14/10) night called a number of prospective ministers and deputy ministers for the upcoming cabinet. The following are key notes: Number of ministries increases – Prabowo called 49 people last night and confirmed that there will be additional calls for remaining minister and deputy minister candidates on Tuesday (15/10). Although it is not yet known which will become ministers or deputy ministers and their ministries, the number of calls appears consistent with reports that the number of ministries will increase in the upcoming administration. Earlier, the upcoming administration was reported to have 46 ministries, up from the current 34 ministries. Economy‑related ministers – 10 of the 17 ministers we consider directly related to the economy in the current administration were called last night. This aligns with previous reporting that Prabowo will retain many ministers from the current cabinet. Responding to the call, Sri Mulyani disclosed that she has again been asked to become Finance Minister. Sri Mulyani also signaled that she is open to continuing in that role. Planned separation of the State Revenue Agency (BPN) – At the same time, Sri Mulyani dismissed the idea of establishing a BPN. Previously, Prabowo was reported to plan to separate the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) and the Directorate General of Customs and Excise (DJBC) from the Ministry of Finance in an effort to increase state revenue. Key Takeaway: Although further clarification is needed, we assess the political developments as generally positive for the market. If the economy‑related ministers retain their positions in the upcoming administration, this will provide certainty and relief for the market that economic stability can be maintained. However, risk arises from the significant increase in the number of ministries which could cause inefficiency. On Tuesday (15/10) the IDX Composite (IHSG) rose 0.89% to 7,627 with net foreign inflow of 289.5 billion rupiah. Meanwhile the rupiah weakened slightly 0.13% to 15,575 per US dollar, still outperforming neighboring currencies such as Malaysia (-0.30%), Thailand (-0.05%) and the Philippines (-0.65%). *Headline this has been released earlier in Stockbit Commentary.",

      "content": "Kementerian Investasi reported that investment realization in Indonesia during the first nine months of 2024 reached 1,261 trillion rupiah, a 19.8% year‑on‑year increase, representing 76.4% of the 2024 target of 1,650 trillion rupiah. Foreign direct investment (PMA) amounted to 654 trillion rupiah (+17% YoY), while domestic investment (PMDN) grew to 607 trillion rupiah (+23% YoY). Chinese media outlet Caixin reported that the Chinese government may raise 6 trillion yuan (approximately 846 billion US dollars) through the issuance of special long‑term bonds over three years, intended to help local governments reduce debt burdens and stimulate a sluggish economy. This news appears amid speculation about the size of China’s upcoming fiscal stimulus package. Reuters surveyed economists expect Bank Indonesia to keep the BI Rate at 6% in the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on 16 October 2024, a shift from earlier expectations of a further cut after the surprise 25‑basis‑point reduction in the previous meeting. The change is driven by a slowdown in expectations of aggressive monetary easing by the Fed following solid US labor data, which has caused the rupiah to depreciate about 3% from its recent peak in September 2024. BPS announced that Indonesia’s trade surplus reached 3.26 billion US dollars in September 2024, surpassing consensus expectations of 2.83 billion dollars. Exports grew 6.44% YoY while imports grew 8.55% YoY, both below consensus forecasts of 8% and 11.8% respectively. Over the first nine months of 2024, the cumulative trade surplus was 27.72 billion US dollars, virtually unchanged from the same period in 2023. The Indian government announced a 9.15 trillion rupee (US$109 billion) power‑grid revamp plan to integrate 600 GW of renewable energy by 2032, targeting 500 GW by 2030 and an additional 100 GW thereafter. Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: WBD) will launch its streaming service Max in seven Asian countries on 19 November 2024, expanding availability to more than 72 countries and offering content from HBO, Discovery, DC Universe, Harry Potter and Cartoon Network in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Transcoal Pacific (TCPI) through its subsidiary PT Energy Transporter Indonesia announced the sale of one barge unit for 6 billion rupiah, aimed at fleet renewal. ITSEC Asia (CYBR) director Bambang Susilo sold 1.5 million shares at an average price of 311 rupiah per share between 11 and 14 October 2024, totaling approximately 478 million rupiah; his ownership fell from 0.486% to 0.463% after the transaction.",
