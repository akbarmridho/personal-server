      "title": "The Fed Cuts Rates by 25 Bps, Projects 2 More Cuts by End of 2025",
      "content": "The US central bank, The Fed, on Wednesday (17/9) local time decided to cut interest rates by 25 bps to the range of 4-4.25%, in line with consensus expectations, marking its first rate cut this year. In a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this step was taken due to recent data showing increasing signs of a weakening US labor market. Nevertheless, Powell emphasized that this decision is not without risk, given that US inflation remains high while the labor market is weakening. Besides the rate cut, The Fed also updated its economic projections for 2025 and 2026, here are the details: The Fed Funds Rate is expected to drop to the range of 3.5-3.75% in 2025, more than the projection in June 2025 in the range of 3.75-4%. This latest projection from The Fed is in line with market expectations based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. For 2026, The Fed projects an additional rate cut of 25 bps, the same as the June 2025 projection. The Fed increased its US economic growth projection, with GDP expected to grow by +1.6% in 2025, +1.8% in 2026, and +1.9% in 2027. For comparison, in June 2025, The Fed expected US economic growth to reach only +1.4% in 2025, +1.6% in 2026, and +1.8% in 2027. The Fed expects core inflation to be 3.1% in 2025, unchanged from the June 2025 projection. Core inflation is expected to decrease to 2.6% in 2026, slightly higher than the June 2025 estimate of 2.4%, before reaching 2.1% in 2027. The Fed also forecasts the unemployment rate to rise to 4.5% in 2025, the same as the June 2025 projection. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% in 2027. The US financial market tended to be muted and moved mixed following The Fed's decision and Powell's comments, with the DJIA strengthening by +0.57% on Wednesday (17/9) while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell by -0.10% and -0.32% respectively. On the same day, the US dollar index (DXY) rose +0.25% to the level of ~96.9, while the 10-year US government bond yield increased by +5.9 bps to the level of 4.087%. CIO of SieberNXT, Mark Malek, told Reuters that the market reaction reflected profit taking (sell on news) over the news of The Fed's rate cut.",
