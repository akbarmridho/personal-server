      "content": "The price of gold in the futures market strengthened +0.03% to the level of US$2,935.3 per troy ounce on Tuesday (11/2), after briefly penetrating the level of US$2,968.5 per troy ounce and marking an intraday all-time high record. This increase continued the strengthening of gold prices by +1.62% on Monday (10/2) night. The rise in gold prices occurred following the announcement from US President Donald Trump, who imposed a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports to the US effective March 12, 2025. Besides these two metals, Trump also stated he would announce retaliatory tariffs this week, with the amount to adjust for tariffs imposed by other countries. This decision threatens an escalation of the trade war and a resurgence of inflation.",

The Chairman of Commission VII of the DPR, Saleh Partaonan Daulay, told Kompas that he had received the letter and his commission had postponed the meeting with the Ministry of Industry which was originally scheduled for Monday (10/2). Saleh was reluctant to speculate on the reason the government finally requested a postponement of the budget efficiency discussion meeting with ministries/agencies, and asked that this matter be directed to the government and the DPR leadership. Previously, President Prabowo Subianto in January 2025 issued a presidential instruction to cut the 2025 State Budget expenditure by up to IDR 306.7 trillion.",

This surge in thermal coal imports was driven by electricity needs for the manufacturing sector in Vietnam, with Reuters reporting that coal-fired power plant (PLTU) capacity in the country will increase by +15% after projects currently under construction are completed. Global Energy Monitor noted that installed power capacity in Vietnam currently reaches about 70 GW, with PLTU contribution reaching about 39%.

This plan will replace the RUPTL for the 2021-2030 period, which targeted a total new capacity of 40.6 GW with about 52% of it coming from EBT. The RUPTL for the 2025-2034 period targets an additional power capacity of 71 GW, so the 70% EBT mix target during this period will drive the EBT mix in the total national power capacity up from around 12% to about 35% by 2034, according to Kartika. Based on the RUPTL for the 2025-2034 period, the government plans to build solar power capacity of 17 GW, hydropower of 16 GW, geothermal power of 5 GW, gas power of 15 GW, and other sources such as wind and bioenergy. The RUPTL also still plans an additional 5 GW of coal-fired power capacity until 2034.",

      "content": "Darma Henwa ($DEWA) announced a plan for an additional private placement of approximately 3.95 billion new shares at a price of 75 rupiah per share to convert debt amounting to approximately 296.6 billion rupiah to PT Antareja Mahada Makmur. PT Antareja Mahada Makmur is a company in the leasing and finance lease sector, as well as a creditor for DEWA's trade payable position amounting to 296.6 billion rupiah. After this transaction, PT Antareja Mahada Makmur's ownership in DEWA will become 9.7% from previously none. This corporate action is part of the private placement plan recently announced by DEWA. Previously, DEWA also planned a private placement of approximately 14.9 billion new shares at a price of 75 rupiah per share to convert debt to PT Madhani Talatah Nusantara and PT Andhesti Tungkas Pratama. Cumulatively, the total of these three private placements amounts to approximately 18.8 billion new shares. DEWA will hold an EGMS on February 13, 2025, to seek shareholder approval for the execution of this corporate action. DEWA shares closed up +8.74% at the level of 112 rupiah per share today, Tuesday (11/2). Key Takeaway: We assess that this debt conversion potentially provides short-term negative sentiment for DEWA because the execution price is lower by -33% compared to the company's share price today, and there is potential for significant dilution for existing shareholders. Based on our calculations, the total three private placements will cause a dilution of existing shareholders' ownership by approximately ~46.3%, with the public ownership portion potentially dropping from 71% to 38.2% post-transaction. From a financial perspective, the debt conversion totaling approximately 1.4 trillion rupiah has the potential to reduce DEWA's Liability-to-Equity Ratio from 1.32x to 0.62x. Although we assess this debt conversion is not the most ideal way to strengthen DEWA's capital structure, this corporate action can have a long-term positive impact if new shareholders can provide added value to the company going forward. *This article was first released as Stockbit Commentary on Tuesday (11/2) morning.",
