      "content": "Coordinator of the Economic Affairs Ministry, Airlangga Hartarto, told the Financial Times that the government is planning a stimulus of US$2 billion to boost consumer spending during the Christmas and New Year holidays. The stimulus package will provide discounts for transportation, food, retail purchases, and tax exemptions for airline tickets. Prior to this, the Financial Times reported that the government had announced a total stimulus of US$4.5 billion since December 2024.\n\nThe Chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (Gapki), Eddy Martono, said that the association expects Indonesia's palm oil exports to increase from 29.5 million tons in 2024 to 30 million tons in 2025, driven by higher purchases from India. This estimate is higher than Gapki's previous projection in July 2025, which forecast 2025 exports at 28 million tons due to the mandatory B40 biodiesel blend. For 2026, Eddy said Indonesian palm oil exports are likely to remain stagnant year-on-year, while total domestic palm oil production is expected to reach 56 million tons, up from an estimated 55 million tons in 2025.\n\nThe Constitutional Court on Monday (29 September) annulled the requirement in the law on People's Housing Savings (Tapera) that obliges workers and employers to deposit a portion of wages into the Tapera program. The Court ruled that Tapera contributions must be optional, not mandatory, and gave the House of Representatives two years to revise the law.\n\nFinance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa temporarily postponed the implementation of a tax on e-commerce merchants with annual turnover between IDR 500 million and IDR 4.8 billion until the economic situation stabilises. Nailul Huda, Director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies, told Kontan that the additional tax revenue from this policy would range between IDR 500 billion and IDR 1.5 trillion.",

      "title": "BBRI 8M25: Net Bank-Only Profit Down 10% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded a net bank-only profit of IDR 4 trillion in August 2025 (-16% YoY, +6% MoM). This result brings the net bank-only profit for the first eight months of 2025 (8M25) to IDR 32.6 trillion (-10% YoY), equal to 57% of the 2025 consolidated consensus estimate (versus 8M24: 60% of 2024 consolidated realization).\n\nProvision expenses remain high. The decline in August net profit was caused by weak non-interest income (-25% YoY), which pressured pre-provision operating profit, and a rise in provision expenses (+34% YoY). Over the 8M25 period, net profit fell due to higher operating expenses (+7% YoY) and higher provision expenses (+7% YoY). In August 2025, BBRI booked provision expenses of IDR 3.5 trillion, the highest monthly provision level since the start of the year when January 2025 is excluded (January recorded a management overlay).\n\nLoan growth slightly increased. As of August 2025, loan growth was +6% YoY, a modest rise from June 2025’s +5% YoY, but still below the 2025 consolidated guidance range of +7-9% YoY. In the 2Q25 earnings call, BBRI management indicated that loan growth for the full year 2025 may only reach the lower bound of the guidance, even before the bank received a liquidity injection of IDR 55 trillion from the government.\n\nKey Takeaway: With a declining interest-rate trend, we assess that pressure on banking margins from funding will ease, not only for BBRI but for the sector overall. However, faster economic growth is needed before investors can see accelerated, high-quality loan growth and a reduction in provision levels. From a valuation perspective, BBRI on Tuesday (30/9) traded at approximately 1.8× 1-Year Forward P/BV, about 1.5 standard deviations below its five-year historical average.",
