      "title": "Property Sector: 9M25 Marketing Sales Compilation",
      "content": "Several residential property issuers have announced their marketing sales realizations for 9M25, including Ciputra Development ($CTRA), Summarecon Agung ($SMRA), Alam Sutera Realty ($ASRI), and Pakuwon Jati ($PWON) [see table]. Here are some highlights from us: SMRA recorded the highest marketing sales growth during 9M25 (+34% YoY), resulting in the realization toward the 2025 marketing sales target reaching 71%, which is better than the previous year (vs. 9M24: 61% realization in 2024). We estimate SMRA's marketing sales surge during 9M25 was driven by the launching of new products in Summarecon Serpong in 2Q25. CTRA recorded the highest realization against the 2025 marketing sales target, reaching 76%. For context, in October 2025, CTRA announced a downward revision of its 2025 marketing sales target from IDR 11 trillion to IDR 10 trillion in line with a more prudent outlook (vs. 2024 realization: IDR 11 trillion). The marketing sales realization for ASRI and PWON during 9M25 reached 60% and 50% of their respective 2025 targets, lower than the achievement in 9M24 (ASRI 9M24: 73% realization in 2024, PWON 9M24: 73% realization in 2024). The achievement of 9M25 marketing sales occurred amidst the government-borne value-added tax (PPN DTP) incentive of 100%. Previously, this incentive was scheduled to end in June 2025 and was set to drop to 50% during the July-December 2025 period, but the government announced in July 2025 that the 100% incentive would continue throughout the July-December 2025 period. In October 2025, the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that the 100% PPN DTP incentive would be extended until 2027. During 9M25, PWON was the issuer with the highest PPN DTP contribution to marketing sales, with 73.3% of total marketing sales originating from products eligible for the incentive. Meanwhile, SMRA has not released data regarding the PPN DTP contribution. Stock prices for ASRI and PWON refer to the left y-axis, while stock prices for SMRA, BSDE, and CTRA refer to the outer right y-axis. The BI Rate (IDBIRRPO Index) refers to the inner right y-axis. Interest rates are displayed with a 40-week lag against stock prices to reflect the expectation factor. KEY TAKEAWAY: We assess that the marketing sales prospect will depend more on improving consumer purchasing power than on lower interest rates. This is because mortgage interest rates have been at relatively low levels and tend to be sticky. For illustration, the average interest rate from commercial banks for mortgages only dropped from 6.91% in December 2024 to 6.84% in June 2025, even though the BI Rate has fallen -125 bps since the beginning of the year. On the other hand, based on historical movements as seen in the chart above, the general trend of declining interest rates has the potential to provide a positive sentiment for the stock price movements of property issuers.",

      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto on Monday (10/20) said that Indonesia will domestically produce a national car within the next 3 years. President Prabowo mentioned that the government has allocated funds and prepared land for the factory that will be the production base for this national car. Minister of ESDM, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that his side is still assessing the schedule for the start of the mandatory 10% bioethanol mixture in gasoline or E10, adding that this policy will likely begin no later than 2027. Bahlil explained that the government will ensure that the construction of domestic ethanol plants can support the supply needs for the bioethanol mixture. The source of bioethanol raw material comes from cassava and sugarcane, which is expected to create new employment opportunities for farmers. The government will impose import duty for safeguard measures (BMTP or safeguard duties) on cotton yarn imports for 3 years starting October 30, 2025, based on Minister of Finance Regulation No. 67/2025. The BMTP tariff will start at IDR 7,500 per kg in the first year and will gradually decrease to IDR 7,277 per kg in the third year. This policy aims to protect the domestic textile industry from import surges that could potentially disrupt the competitiveness of local producers. Bisnis reported that the management of Perintis Triniti Properti ($TRIN) in a public exposition on Tuesday (10/21) stated they were in intensive discussion stages with potential strategic partners to strengthen their business structure and capital. However, TRIN management did not elaborate further.",
