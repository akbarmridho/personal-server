      "title": "Foreign Inflow Continues, IDX Approaches 8,000",
      "content": "IDX (IHSG) strengthened by 1.3% to 7,892.9 on Wednesday, 13 August, driven by continued foreign fund inflow of approximately 1.5 trillion rupiah. This marks net foreign inflow for three consecutive trading days on the IDX since the start of the week, including an inflow of 2.2 trillion rupiah on Tuesday (12 August) which was the highest daily inflow since 14 May 2025. Since the start of 2025, the IDX has recorded a net foreign outflow of 57.3 trillion rupiah as of Wednesday (13 August).\n\nThe arrival of foreign funds lifted the prices of blue-chip stocks since the start of the week, with BBRI up 10.3%, BMRI up 4.3%, BBCA up 7.5%, BBNI up 7.4%, ASII up 5.2% and TLKM up 14.3%. The foreign inflow and the blue-chip rally followed the price increase of the conglomerate group after the MSCI announcement on Friday (8 August), where DSSA and CUAN were added to the MSCI Indonesia Global Standard.\n\nThe rise of the above stocks brought the IDX close to the 8,000 level, in line with optimism expressed by IDX President Iman Rachman, who said that the IDX could break the 8,000 level on the 80th anniversary of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nPositive sentiment also comes from the global side as expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut strengthen, following weak US labor data and US inflation data that are broadly in line with expectations, as well as the extension of the US-China trade negotiation timeline. As of Wednesday (13 August), the probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the September 2025 meeting stood at 96.2% according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Through the end of the year, the probability of a minimum 50-basis-point Fed cut is at 93.7%, slightly higher than a week earlier at 92.7%.\n\nForeign inflow into the Indonesian capital market started earlier in the sovereign bond market, reflected by a decline in the 10-year government bond yield to 6.406% today, down 0.175 percentage points month-to-date. The rupiah also appreciated to 16,195 per US dollar today, marking a 1.8% month-to-date strengthening.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that the continuation of foreign inflow will depend partly on improvements in Indonesia’s economic fundamentals. In the short term, we see investors focusing on the potential acceleration of government spending in the second half of 2025. From a global perspective, investors need to monitor the impact of US tariff policies that began to be implemented in August 2025, given their potential influence on inflation and Fed policy direction.",

      "content": "1. Minister of Village and Disadvantaged Region Development, Yandri Susanto, said on Wednesday (13 Aug) that the Merah Putih Village Cooperative, which experienced default, will receive support from village funds up to 30% of the village fund allocation per year. The village fund allocation varies per village, ranging from 400 million rupiah to 1.6 billion rupiah.\n\n2. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources recorded that realized investment in the energy and mineral resources sector during 1H25 grew 24.1% YoY to 13.9 billion USD or ~225.5 trillion rupiah, marking the highest realization in five years. Investment growth was driven by oil & gas (+28.8% YoY) and mining (+29.2% YoY). By sector, oil & gas contributed 58% of investment, followed by mining 22%, electricity 14%, and renewable energy (EBT) 6%. From the state revenue side, non-tax revenue of the ministry during 1H25 reached 138.8 trillion rupiah, equal to 54.5% of the 2025 target.\n\n3. Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi, said that the presidential regulation on accelerating waste-to-energy power plant development will eliminate the tipping-fee mechanism that local governments currently pay to plant operators per ton of waste processed. The new model will be licensing-based. Eniya added that Danantara could handle the selection of waste-to-energy project developers before licensing at the ministry. However, Danantara’s involvement is limited to projects processing at least 1,000 tons per day.\n\n4. Vice Minister of Finance of China, Liao Min, said on Wednesday (13 Aug) that the Chinese government plans to offer loan-interest subsidies to households and businesses to reduce borrowing costs and stimulate consumption. This policy differs from the previous policy where the Chinese government required banks to offer cheap-interest loans. Previously, on Tuesday (12 Aug), the Chinese government announced it would offer a 1-percentage-point interest subsidy for enterprises in eight consumer-service sectors and for individual consumers.\n\n5. The government on Tuesday (12 Aug) increased the number of airports with international status from 22 to 40 to boost tourism and economic growth in the era of President Prabowo Subianto. This reverses the policy of the previous administration under President Joko Widodo, which last year reduced the number of international airports to 17 to cut costs. Last year, the government said only five airports operated regular international flights, while the rest only served limited or no international routes.",
