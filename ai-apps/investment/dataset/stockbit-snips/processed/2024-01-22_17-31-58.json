      "title": "Nickel Price Continues to Fall, Global Producers Shaken",
      "content": "The prolonged decline in nickel prices is starting to have a negative impact on global nickel producers, particularly in Australia. Several producers have decided to temporarily close their mines, while others have announced they will re-evaluate their projects. Here are the details: Wyloo Metals: announced it will temporarily close its nickel mine operations in Kambalda, Australia, at the end of May 2024 due to low nickel prices. This announcement came only 6 months after Wyloo Metals acquired the mine for 760 million US dollars. BHP: announced it is re-evaluating its nickel business. According to a Reuters report, BHP may need to postpone its 1.2 billion US dollar nickel project in West Musgrave, Australia. BHP stated that it is exploring options to mitigate the impact of the sharp drop in nickel prices and will provide further details in its half-year report on February 20, 2024. First Quantum Minerals: announced it will cut the number of workers and production at the Ravensthorpe mine, Australia, due to significant nickel price drops. As of January 22, 2024, the nickel price has fallen -44.64% YoY to 15,799 US dollars per ton, pressured by the soaring supply from Indonesia, the world's largest producer. The International Nickel Study Group projected that the surplus in the global nickel market will widen from 223,000 tons in 2023 to 239,000 tons in 2024. Allan Ray Restauro, an analyst at BloombergNEF, said that Indonesian nickel projects are more flexible in absorbing the impact of falling nickel prices. This is because nickel production in Indonesia is supported by cheap labor costs, low energy prices, and abundant raw materials. The nickel price itself is projected to remain suppressed, with Citigroup estimating the nickel price will drop to 15,500 US dollars per ton in the next 3 months. Meanwhile, ING Group projects the average nickel price will be at 16,813 US dollars per ton throughout 2024. Key Takeaway: Nickel prices, expected to remain suppressed this year, will be a challenge for the profitability of nickel mining companies. In this condition, issuers with efficient operations and low cost structures will tend to be more immune to the negative impact of falling nickel prices. One factor that can make an issuer's production cost lower is an integrated operational area. As of 9M23, here is the breakdown of RKEF nickel cash cost from issuers listed on the IDX: $INCO: 9,832 US dollars per ton. $NCKL: 10,196-10,646 US dollars per ton. $MBMA: 12,958-15,247 US dollars per ton (all-in sustainable cost)*. $ANTM: 14,000-15,000 US dollars per ton. Meanwhile, if the trend of production cuts continues to other global nickel producers, this has the potential to reduce supply and support nickel prices going forward.",

China imported 220.25 million tons of Indonesian coal during 2023, growing +29% YoY and contributing 46.42% of China's total coal imports. During 2023, China imported 474.42 million tons of coal, growing +61.8% YoY and marking an all-time high record. Coal imports from Australia grew 18 times to 52.47 million tons, driven by the revocation of the Australian coal import ban since January 2023, but still -32.3% lower than the 2020 realization when the ban was not yet in effect. Agung Wicaksono, Deputy for Financing and Investment at the IKN Authority, said that the realization of investment commitments in IKN during 2023 reached 41.4 trillion rupiah, lower than the target of 45 trillion rupiah. Agung mentioned that this realization missed the target because the groundbreaking schedule for several projects was postponed due to Christmas and New Year holidays. Agung is optimistic that investment realization in IKN in 2024 will exceed 2023, considering that investments throughout last year only started coming in September-December 2023. Roy Nicholas Mandey, Chairman of the Indonesian Retail Entrepreneurs Association (Aprindo), is optimistic that retail business growth in 2024 will range from +3.7-3.8% YoY, driven by political party consumption during the election period. Besides that, Roy also mentioned that the main drivers of growth are household consumption and government spending. The latest survey from Indikator Politik Indonesia found that the electability of Prabowo Subianto rose to 48.6% from 45.8% in the previous survey. The latest survey from Lembaga Survei Indonesia also found Prabowo's electability rose to 47% from 45.6% in the previous survey. Last week, Indonesia Polling Stations recorded that Prabowo Subianto's electability rose to 51.8% after the third debate.",
