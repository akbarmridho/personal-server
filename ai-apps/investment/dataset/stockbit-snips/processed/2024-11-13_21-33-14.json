      "title": "ADRO: Analysis of AADI Spin-off Scenarios",
      "content": "Approaching Adaro Energy Indonesia's (ADRO) EGM on November 18, 2024, and the pre-emptive rights offering (PUPS) of Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AADI) in December 2024, we attempt to analyze the optimal option for ADRO investors regarding the AADI spin-off corporate action. There are 2 options for ADRO investors, namely: Participating in the AADI PUPS. This option is further broken down into 3 scenarios, namely: Base-case scenario: implying 5x PE for AADI and 6.6x PE for ADRO. Bull-case scenario: implying 5x PE for AADI and 8.9x PE for ADRO. Bear-case scenario: implying 5x PE for AADI and 3.8x PE for ADRO. Not participating in the AADI PUPS. Option 1: Participating in the AADI PUPS Based on our calculations, ADRO investors who use their dividends to participate in the AADI PUPS are potentially more advantaged because: The price of ADRO shares is highly likely to fall after the AADI spin-off and dividend distribution due to reduced net profit potential post-spin-off. If the price of ADRO shares does not decrease after the spin-off, ADRO has the potential to trade at a valuation of 13.3x PE. The price of AADI shares has the potential for a re-rating to the 5x PE level, which we consider a more reasonable and conservative level. This 5x PE level is still below ADRO's 5-year historical mean of 6.9x PE, as well as the valuation of other coal issuers such as PTBA (7.7x PE FY24F annualized) and ITMG (6.87x PE FY24F annualized). In the long term, ADRO's valuation will be influenced by market sentiment and net profits from the development of the aluminum smelter and hydroelectric power plant (PLTA) projects, which are expected to commence operations in 2025 and 2030, respectively. Option 2: Not Participating in the AADI IPO Meanwhile, we see that investors who only take the dividend and do not participate in the AADI PUPS potentially receive lower returns or even risk suffering losses compared to investors who participate in the AADI PUPS. This is because investors who do not participate in the AADI PUPS will face a potential decline in ADRO share prices without gaining the potential upside from the increase in AADI share prices. The AADI PUPS redemption rights cannot be sold either. Investors who choose this option potentially lose the ADRO thermal coal business at a valuation of 2.7x PE 1H24 annualized, lower than the 5-year historical mean of ADRO and its peers. Notes: Assumptions We Used Some basic assumptions we used in our calculations are: The purchase price for ADRO uses the closing price on Tuesday (12/11) at Rp3,820/share. The dividend paid by ADRO reaches the maximum level, which is Rp1,352/share. Dividend payment is implemented concurrently with the PUPS execution. The AADI PUPS price equals the upper limit of the IPO price range at Rp5,900/share, which is also the maximum limit of the PUPS price range. The subscription ratio is 100:23 (every 100 ADRO shares owned will receive the right to subscribe to 23 AADI shares in the PUPS). The Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar is 15,811. This article was released in Stockbit Commentary, where investors can view more complete assumptions/data here: https://stockbit.com/post/16333888. Key Takeaway From the scenarios above, we see that investors potentially book a larger profit if they exercise their right to exercise the AADI PUPS compared to just taking dividends and not exercising the AADI PUPS. Using the worst-case scenario in the bear-case scenario, where ADRO shares are valued using only 50% cash + 50% holding discount for ADMR (equivalent to 3.8x PE), investors potentially book only a loss of -5.7%. This figure is still smaller compared to the potential loss if investors do not execute the AADI PUPS, which is around -14.9%.",
