      "title": "China Economy Exceeds Expectations, Coal Imports Reach All-Time High",
      "content": "The National Bureau of Statistics of China recorded that China's economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 reached +5.4% year-on-year (YoY) compared with +4.6% YoY in the third quarter, beating the consensus expectation of +5% YoY and representing the highest annual growth in the last six quarters. This result brings China's total 2024 growth to +5% YoY (2023: +5.2%), in line with the Chinese government target and above the World Bank projection of +4.9% YoY. On a quarterly basis, the Chinese economy grew +1.6% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in Q4 2024 (Q3: +1.3% QoQ), matching consensus expectations.\n\nThe Q4 2024 growth was driven by a series of stimulus measures from the government and the central bank since September 2024 to support the economic recovery. For 2025, the World Bank projects Chinese growth to slow to +4.5% YoY as household and business confidence wanes, property sector constraints persist, and trade-war risks remain. Although slower, the projection is still +0.4 percentage points higher than the World Bank's previous estimate.\n\nIn December 2024, Reuters reported that the Chinese government planned to set a growth target of around +5% for 2025, with the fiscal deficit rising from 3% to 4% of GDP. The report appeared a few days after Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, concluded the annual economic conference in Beijing, where they are believed to have set the target that will be formally announced at the parliamentary session in March 2025. Bloomberg reported that the two targets are largely in line with economists' expectations.\n\nIn addition to the above-expectation growth, China also recorded the highest ever coal imports in 2024, amounting to 542.7 million tonnes (+14.4% YoY). This volume represents 41% of total global coal imports, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group. China's 2024 coal imports were more than twice the amount imported by India, the world's second-largest coal importer, which imported 250.2 million tonnes last year.\n\nBased on BPS data, Indonesia's coal export volume to China in 2024 reached approximately 93.2 million tonnes (+14.1% YoY), although the export value fell by -6% YoY to about US$6.6 billion.\n\nFor 2025, the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association projects that Chinese coal imports will decline by -3.26% YoY to 525 million tonnes as domestic production increases. The association also forecasts that Chinese coal production will grow +1.5% YoY in 2025, while demand is expected to grow around +1% YoY.\n\nKey Takeaway: We assess that the outlook for Chinese coal demand will depend on the extent and effectiveness of further stimulus measures that the Chinese government may deploy to boost growth. The demand and import projections from the association do not specify the stimulus assumptions used. An increase in coal demand is crucial to offset the predicted rise in domestic coal production in 2025, both from China itself and from Indonesia.\n\nOn the other hand, we note that the decline in ICI coal prices – which is more relevant for Indonesian producers – has been much milder than the recent drop in Newcastle coal prices. This could provide support for the performance of those producers. Additionally, domestic potential revisions to coal royalties could also be a factor that investors need to monitor.",

      "content": "The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said on Thursday (16/1) that the revision of the placement of export proceeds from natural resources (DHE SDA) is now in the finalization stage and is likely to be released next week. Previously, Airlangga indicated last week that the government will revise the minimum tenor for DHE SDA placement from three months to one year. It is still unclear whether the share of DHE SDA placement will change from the existing minimum of 30%.\n\nThe Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Thursday (16/1) that the government targets oil lifting to reach 900,000 barrels per day by 2029, far above the 2024 realization of 571,700 barrels per day, which itself was below the 2024 APBN target of 625,000 barrels per day.\n\nBahlil also said that it is almost certain that the specific natural gas price incentive (HGBT) of USD 6.5 per MMBtu for seven industry groups will be continued, although he did not specify when the incentive will be reinstated. The HGBT incentive ended on 31 December 2024, prompting industry players to request its continuation to maintain domestic competitiveness. Bahlil mentioned that there is a proposal to increase the number of industry groups receiving HGBT, but the Ministry is still studying it. Previously, Bahlil said the ministry was discussing a possible reduction in the number of HGBT recipients, especially for companies that have shown a good internal rate of return.\n\nThe President Director of PT Dyandra Promosindo, Daswar Marpaung, said on Thursday (16/1) that the Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS) 2025, to be held at JIExpo Kemayoran, Jakarta, targets a total transaction value of IDR 6.7 trillion, equal to the 2024 realization. Despite a challenging automotive industry environment, Daswar believes the target can be achieved thanks to an increased number of participating brands. According to Kompas, IIMS 2025 will feature 24 motorcycle brands and 33 car brands (2024: 28 motorcycle brands and 23 car brands). IIMS 2025 will run from 13 to 23 February 2025.\n\nSuhindarto, Head of Economic Research Division at Pefindo, said on Thursday (16/1) that the institution projects the average coupon of retail government bonds (SBN) in 2025 to be between 6.3% and 6.7%. The projection assumes tenors of 2-6 years and continued monetary easing. The government plans to issue eight series of retail SBN in 2025.\n\nReuters reported that India's crude palm oil (CPO) imports in January 2025 fell to the lowest level since March 2020. An anonymous Indian official told Reuters that India imported only 110,000 tonnes of CPO in the first half of January 2025, far below the usual monthly imports of over 750,000 tonnes. Industry sources said Indian CPO imports could drop to around 370,000 tonnes in January 2025, pressured by negative refinery margins as CPO prices are more premium than substitute products.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau recorded that U.S. retail sales grew +0.4% month-on-month (MoM) in December 2024 (November 2024: +0.8% MoM), below the consensus expectation of +0.6% MoM and marking the lowest growth in four months. Core retail sales, used for GDP calculations, grew +0.7% MoM, the highest in three months. Annually, U.S. retail sales rose +3.9% YoY in December 2024 (November 2024: +4.1% YoY).\n\nThe Ministry of Finance released on Thursday (16/1) Regulation No. 136/2024 to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% effective 1 January 2025, as part of the G20-OECD initiative to curb tax competition. The tax applies to multinational enterprises with annual global turnover exceeding EUR 750 million. The Head of the Fiscal Policy Agency, Febrio Kacaribu, said the government will provide tax incentives to ensure the minimum tax does not affect investment, without detailing the incentives.",
