      "title": "Oil Rises +2.65% Due to Iran Attack on Israel",
      "content": "Brent crude oil prices in futures markets soared by more than +5% on Wednesday (2/10) before closing strong, strengthening by +2.65% to the level of 75.5 US dollars per barrel, driven by market concerns over supply disruption risks following the escalation of geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. These concerns arose after Iran launched its largest attack on Israel [on Tuesday](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-missile-attack-middle-east-10-02-24-intl-hnk#cm1r16rw5004526qn43urbhjs) (1/10), which was stated as retaliation for Israel's strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon last weekend. Following the Iranian attack, an anonymous Israeli official told [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/02/iran-israel-missile-attacks-response) that Israel would launch a counter-attack, likely targeting Iranian oil production facilities and other strategic locations. Iran itself [is](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/02/oil-watchers-now-see-a-real-threat-of-supply-disruptions-after-latest-iran-israel-escalation.html) the third largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with production reaching 3.7 million barrels per day in August 2024, or about 4% of total global production. Before surging on Wednesday (2/10), Brent crude oil prices in futures markets had weakened to around 70 US dollars per barrel in September 2024, tracking the slowdown of the global economy and OPEC+'s [plan](https://snips.stockbit.com/snips-terbaru/opec-lanjutkan-peningkatan-produksi-pada-desember-2024) to reduce oil production cuts starting in December 2024. OPEC itself [estimates](https://publications.opec.org/woo/chapter/129/2356) that oil demand growth will drop from 2.2 million barrels per day in 2024 to 1.8 million barrels per day in 2025. Key Takeaway: The rise in oil prices provides a positive sentiment for oil and oil supporting company stocks, with [$MEDC]() (+8.95%), [$ENRG]() (+7.21%), [$WINS]() (+6.71%), [$ELSA]() (+6.99%), and [$LEAD]() (+6.38%) strengthening on Wednesday (2/10). In the short term, oil prices will be influenced by geopolitical developments, especially if conditions continue to heat up. In the longer term, the outlook for oil prices will be influenced by how successful the stimulus package released by the Chinese government to recover its economy (increasing oil demand) is, compared to the potential additional supply from planned increases in OPEC+ production. *This article was released earlier in [Stockbit Commentary](https://stockbit.com/post/15934268).",

      "content": "Institute for Supply Management (ISM) [recorded](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/manufacturing-pmi-at-47-2-september-2024-manufacturing-ism-report-on-business-302263093.html) that the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing in the US stabilized at 47.2 in September 2024, slightly below the projection of 47.5 and marking the sixth consecutive month of contraction. The Chair of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee at ISM, Timothy Fiore, stated that demand remains weak as companies in the US are still reluctant to invest due to the tight monetary policy during the survey period and election uncertainty. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics [noted](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) that the number of job vacancies in the US increased by 329,000 to 8.04 million in August 2024 (vs. July 2024: 7.71 million), exceeding the consensus expectation of 7.66 million. The Minister of National Development Planning, Suharso Monoarfa, stated that his office has obtained data on regional governments that often manipulate inflation data to obtain incentives from the central government. Suharso also mentioned that his office is pushing the Minister of Home Affairs, Tito Karnavian, to impose penalties on regional heads who manipulate inflation data. Based on [Kontan's](https://epaper.kontan.co.id/mobile/harian/2024/10/02) records, the Ministry of Finance has provided fiscal incentives totaling 300 billion rupiah to 50 regional governments deemed capable of controlling inflation in their respective areas. The Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, [said](https://market.bisnis.com/read/20241001/192/1804034/erick-thohir-beberkan-rencana-perampingan-bumn-jadi-30-entitas) that the number of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) in the future will shrink to only 30 companies from the current 47 companies. Nevertheless, Erick mentioned that the plan to streamline the number of BUMNs will be aligned with the direction of the elected president, Prabowo Subianto. Wyloo Metals Pty. Ltd. - a private investment entity owned by Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest - [signed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/billionaire-forrest-pursues-green-nickel-index-with-metalshub) a memorandum of understanding with the trading platform, Metalshub, to explore the launch of a 'green nickel' price index. This collaboration is designed to 'establish a new global standard' for the sale of low-carbon nickel and concentrate, where buyers will receive information about the origin and carbon footprint of the nickel. Forrest himself in February 2024 criticized several companies for using batteries made with cheap nickel from Indonesia, known for having a higher emission footprint and questionable environmental standards. In early 2024, Wyloo Metals [announced](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-22/andrew-forrest-company-to-close-kambalda-nickel-mines-wa/103375250) the temporary closure of its nickel mine operations in Kambalda, Australia, starting end of May 2024 due to low nickel prices. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) on Wednesday (2/10) [announced](https://www.reuters.com/technology/oracle-invest-65-billion-set-up-cloud-facilities-malaysia-2024-10-02/) plans to invest more than 6.5 billion US dollars to establish its first public cloud region in Malaysia. Oracle's announcement marks the latest major investment by a global technology company in Malaysia. Previously, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA), Alphabet (Nasdaq: GOOGL), and ByteDance had announced multi-billion US dollar digital investments in Malaysia since last year. The investments of these companies in Malaysia have largely entered the cloud services and data center sectors, which serve as infrastructure amidst increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).",
