      "title": "IHSG +5.5% This Week Shows Signs of Recovery",
      "content": "IHSG strengthened by 5.5% since the start of the week on Thursday (6 March 2025, after being in a bearish trend with a 21% decline from its recent peak in mid-September 2024. The rally raises the question of whether the downtrend has ended and a rebound can continue, or if the market could fall again. We examined historical IHSG movements to answer this. In the past 20 years, there were eight instances where the index fell significantly (defined as a minimum 15% decline). Two of those were caused by massive crises – the Covid-19 pandemic (-38.4%) and the Global Financial Crisis (-61.6%). Excluding those two, the average weakening from the remaining six events was -21.4% with a range of 15.8-26.9%. Full rebound: in all eight cases the index eventually recovered to pre-decline levels, with five cases where it even exceeded the prior level. The first-volume trade-war decline (Feb-July 2018) also saw a rebound, showing similarity to the current situation. Important notes and disclaimer: two significant declines (2005-2006) were excluded because the index level was below 2,000, making them less comparable. Decline and rebound measurements may contain chart-analysis subjectivity. There is no certainty that the current decline will not turn into a crisis with historically massive drops. Key takeaway: if investors judge the current situation is not a crisis and the likelihood of a crisis is low, history shows the current decline is near its end and could be followed by a significant rebound.",

The DME project, which converts coal into LPG-grade fuel, could reduce state revenue because the Job Creation Law signed by President Joko Widodo exempts royalties for coal-to-LPG projects.
