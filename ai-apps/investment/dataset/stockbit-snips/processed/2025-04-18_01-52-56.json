However, for a more significant IHSG recovery, increased foreign investor confidence is needed so that the foreign outflow trend can reverse.

      "content": "1. Gold prices in the spot market briefly touched an all-time high of 3,357 US dollars per troy ounce during intraday trading on Wednesday (April 16), before closing at 3,342 US dollars per troy ounce (+3.5%). Since the beginning of 2025, gold prices have surged about 700 US dollars per troy ounce (+27.6% YTD), supported by global uncertainty and the weakening US dollar due to trade war escalation. On Thursday (April 17), gold prices weakened -0.53% to 3,325 US dollars per troy ounce. 2. Newcastle forward coal prices for April 2025 fell -1.3% to 94.25 US dollars per ton on Wednesday (April 16), marking the lowest level since May 2021. Coal prices themselves have plummeted in recent months in line with declining demand from China, which is experiencing oversupply, while China's monthly coal production reached an all-time high in March 2025. 3. Chinese President, Xi Jinping, on Thursday (April 17) promoted the idea of an \"Asian family\" and called for regional unity to counter US pressure on other countries to limit trade relations with China. This idea was conveyed by Xi during his visit to Cambodia, which concluded his Southeast Asia tour this week after visiting Vietnam and Malaysia. 4. The US Census Bureau recorded that US retail sales surged +1.4% MoM in March 2025 (vs. Feb 2025: +0.2% MoM), exceeding consensus expectations of +1.3% MoM and marking the largest growth since January 2023. This realization was driven by increased motor vehicle and parts sales (+5.3% MoM), in line with accelerated purchasing to avoid import tariffs. Excluding automotive, US retail sales grew +0.5% MoM in March 2025. Meanwhile, core retail sales - whose movement is similar to the consumer spending component of US GDP data - grew +0.4% MoM (vs. Feb 2025: +1% MoM), lower than consensus expectations of +0.6% MoM. 5. The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, said on Wednesday (April 16) that the Fed will wait for more data on the direction of the economy before changing interest rates. Powell also warned that the tariff policy from US President, Donald Trump, risks pushing inflation and unemployment further away from the Fed's targets. Powell also mentioned that US economic growth appears to be slowing with consumer spending growing moderately. Furthermore, Powell stated that the surge in imports to avoid tariff implementation dates is likely to put pressure on US GDP estimates. 6. The US Department of State said on Wednesday (April 16) that US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, had met with Indonesian Foreign Minister, Sugiono, to discuss tariff negotiations as well as deepening defense and security cooperation. The US Department of State also said that Rubio welcomed Indonesia's efforts. Previously, in a tariff negotiation proposal with the US government, the Indonesian government proposed importing around 18-19 billion US dollars of US goods and offered Indonesian State-Owned Enterprises to invest in the US oil, gas, and information technology sectors. 7. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on Wednesday (April 16) awarded 5 oil and gas blocks to auction winners as an effort to replenish oil and gas reserves. Reuters reported that the government plans to offer nearly 60 oil and gas blocks in the coming years to reverse the decline in production that has occurred over the last decade. 8. The European Union regulator changed the submission period for deforestation law import compliance documents to once a year, lighter than the previous rule which required importers to submit documents with every shipment. This regulatory relief emerged after pressure from the industry, as well as following the postponement of the implementation of the anti-deforestation law for 1 year to December 30, 2025. In June 2025, EU regulators will release categories for importing countries into 'high risk', 'standard', or 'low risk' groups, where imports from low-risk countries will receive relief on compliance requirements for the regulation.",
