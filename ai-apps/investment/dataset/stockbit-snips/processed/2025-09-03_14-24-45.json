      "title": "PANI Plans Rights Issue to Increase Ownership in CBDK",
      "content": "Pantai Indah Kapuk Dua ($PANI) plans to hold a rights issue of up to 1.21 billion new shares. The exercise price has not been announced, but PANI assumes proceeds of approximately 16.73 trillion rupiah in its information disclosure. The proceeds from the rights issue will be used for: 1) purchasing shares of Bangun Kosambi Sukses ($CBDK) up to 44.1% from PT Agung Sedayu and PT Tunas Mekar Jaya worth 16.125 trillion rupiah, resulting in PANI's ownership in CBDK increasing from 45.9% to approximately 90%; and 2) capital injection into 3 subsidiaries of PANI. PANI will hold an EGM on October 9, 2025, to seek shareholder approval for this corporate action. 1. Estimated Minimum Rights Issue Exercise Price at Rp13,800/Share With the assumption of raising proceeds of approximately 16.73 trillion rupiah from the issuance of up to 1.21 billion new shares, the estimated minimum exercise price for PANI's rights issue is in the range of 13,800 rupiah per share. It should be noted that PANI has not yet announced the exercise price for the rights issue. Furthermore, the rights issue exercise price can change significantly to be higher than the estimate (for example, above the market price) if the company issues fewer new shares than the maximum planned. For comparison, in the 2023 rights issue, PANI ultimately only issued approximately 2.1 billion new shares out of the maximum 8 billion new shares planned in the initial disclosure. 2. Estimated CBDK Share Purchase Price at Rp6,450/Share Using a transaction value object of 16.1 trillion rupiah in the disclosure for the acquisition of 44.1% of CBDK shares, this implies a valuation of 100% of CBDK shares at 36.6 trillion rupiah or approximately 6,450 rupiah per share. This estimated price is not significantly different from the CBDK share price at the previous day's closing on Tuesday (2/9), which was 6,550 rupiah per share. Given that there will be no change in control at CBDK after this transaction, it is unlikely there will be a mandatory tender offer for CBDK post-transaction. Key Takeaway We estimate the current total NAV of CBDK reaches 146 trillion rupiah, implying PANI's current NAV with a 45.9% ownership in CBDK is around 286.6 trillion rupiah. Assuming PANIâ€™s ownership stake in CBDK rises to approximately 90% after the acquisition, we estimate PANI's NAV will become 351.1 trillion rupiah, an increase of +23% or 64.5 trillion rupiah from the current estimate (see table above). Assuming an estimated NAV for CBDK of 146 trillion rupiah, this transaction plan implies PANI will acquire CBDK at a 75% Discount-to-NAV valuation. We assess this transaction valuation as quite cheap, especially considering that some of CBDK's landbank is in the CBD PIK 2 area, which is more developed and premiumly located. The estimated NAV increase for PANI of approximately 64.5 trillion rupiah or about +23% from the current level also appears higher than the potential dilution post rights issue.",

      "content": "1. $BREN: Barito Renewables Energy shareholder affiliated with the controller, Green Era Pte. Ltd., sold approximately 28.2 million BREN shares at an average price of 8,913 rupiah per share on August 27 - September 1, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 251.7 billion rupiah and was intended to increase the free float of outstanding shares. After this transaction, Green Era Pte. Ltd.'s ownership in BREN decreased from approximately 22.1% to approximately 22.08%. 2. $TLKM: Telkom Indonesia announced it will postpone the EGM originally scheduled for September 3, 2025. The company stated it will reschedule the EGM and the announcement will be delivered later.

Previously, the SVP Corporate Communication & Investor Relation of TLKM, Ahmad Reza, told Bloomberg Technoz that the company plans to add an independent commissioner position. 3. $MBMA: Merdeka Battery Materials provided Sharia-compliant financing (mudharabah) of approximately 1.8 trillion rupiah to its subsidiary, PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia. This fund will be used by PT Merdeka Tsingshan Indonesia to repay part of the principal loan from the previous loan facility. This transaction is a follow-up to the use of funds from the issuance of sukuk worth approximately 1.8 trillion rupiah by MBMA on August 20, 2025. 4. $BNII: The President Director of Bank Maybank Indonesia, Steffano Ridwan, stated that they will spin off the Sharia Business Unit (UUS) into a full-fledged Sharia commercial bank if the UUS asset value reaches 50 trillion rupiah, which BNII targets to achieve by 2027. The UUS of BNII as of 1H25 itself has total assets of 40.9 trillion rupiah, placing it as the 5th largest Islamic bank in Indonesia. However, when asked by the media regarding acquisition prospects in the spin-off plan, Steffano declined to answer.",

      "title": "Bank Indonesia to Support State Budget Funding through New Burden Sharing Agreement",
      "content": "Other hot news you need to know... 1. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated on Tuesday (2/9) that Bank Indonesia will support state budget financing through a new burden sharing agreement with the government. Bank Indonesia will bear some of the interest costs of certain government bonds purchased in the secondary market, where the proceeds from these bonds are used to finance programs such as building 3 million houses per year and the Red and White Village Cooperatives. In this scheme, the difference between the yield of 10-year tenor government bonds and the government deposit interest rate will be split 2 ways between Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance. For now, there are no details regarding how long this scheme will last or how many government bonds Bank Indonesia will bear the interest costs for. Perry also mentioned that Bank Indonesia has purchased around 200 trillion rupiah of government bonds in the secondary market throughout this year, but he did not specify whether Bank Indonesia is bearing the interest costs for part or all of that amount. 2. Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani, on Tuesday (2/9) asserted that the government will not impose new taxes or raise tax rates in 2026, even though the 2026 Draft State Budget targets state revenue to increase by +9.8% YoY and tax receipts to increase by about +13% YoY compared to the 2025 State Budget outlook. Sri Mulyani mentioned that the target for increased state revenue in the 2026 Draft State Budget will be boosted through improved taxpayer compliance. Sri Mulyani also mentioned that the government is committed to ensuring that affluent community groups can pay taxes easily, while small and needy groups remain protected through incentives. 3. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated on Tuesday (2/9) that they forecast banking credit growth in the range of +9-12% YoY in 2026, compared to the projection of +8-11% YoY this year. Perry also mentioned that Bank Indonesia continues to look for room to cut interest rates given low inflation, a stable rupiah, and the need to boost economic growth. 4. Chairman of the Indonesian General Insurance Association, Budi Herawan, stated that this month the association plans to request a relaxation or extension of time from the OJK regarding the first stage of the minimum equity fulfillment obligation which will be effective per December 31, 2026. Budi explained that this step considers the challenges faced by the insurance industry in meeting these requirements amid uncertain economic conditions. Previously, the OJK issued POJK No. 23/2023 which mandates the first stage of minimum capital increase per December 31, 2026, requiring conventional insurance companies to meet a minimum capital rule of 250 billion rupiah, Sharia insurance companies of 100 billion rupiah, reinsurance of 500 billion rupiah, and Sharia reinsurance of 200 billion rupiah.",
