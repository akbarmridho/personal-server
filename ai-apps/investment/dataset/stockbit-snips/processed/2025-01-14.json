      "content": "Management of AKR Corporindo ($AKRA) announced its 2025 guidance: net profit is expected at approximately IDR 2.4-2.6 trillion, 4-18% YoY higher than the 2024 consensus estimate of IDR 2.2-2.3 trillion. The 2024 consensus itself is about 18-21% lower YoY than the 2023 net profit of IDR 2.8 trillion. Net profit from the fuel trading and chemical distribution segment is targeted to grow 5-7% YoY, driven by fuel demand from the mining sector and new chemical sales. Land sales in JIIPE, Gresik are targeted at about 80-110 hectares (versus 9M24 actual 32 hectares), driven by sales delayed in 2024 and recognized in 2025, such as 50 hectares from Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology Co. and 30 hectares from other clients. Utility revenue is projected to rise significantly as tenants Xinyi Glass and the normalisation of PT Freeport Indonesia’s smelter operations commence mid-2025.\n\nIn addition to the 2025 guidance, AKRA signed a land-sale agreement with Aneka Tambang ($ANTM) on 27 December 2024, although the land area and transaction value were not disclosed. According to ANTM’s Business Development Director I Dewa Wirantaya, the presence of PT Freeport Indonesia’s smelter in JIIPE will give ANTM additional benefit because the company will have direct access to 99.99% pure gold concentrate.\n\nIn a separate transaction, AKRA’s controlling shareholder PT Arthakencana Rayatama bought 1.5 million AKRA shares at an average price of IDR 1,065.4 per share on 7 and 9 January 2025. The transaction, worth roughly IDR 1.6 billion, raised PT Arthakencana Rayatama’s ownership from 63.611% to 63.619%. This is the first AKRA share purchase by the shareholder in 2025, the last accumulation having been in September 2024.",
