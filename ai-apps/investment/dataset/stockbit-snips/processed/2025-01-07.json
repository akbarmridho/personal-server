      "title": "Realization of the 2024 State Budget: Deficit On Target",
      "content": "Realization of the 2024 State Budget (APBN): Deficit on Target\n\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani on Monday (6 January) announced that the 2024 fiscal deficit reached 2.29% of GDP, meeting the original target even though it is larger than the 2023 APBN result of 1.61% of GDP. The result is also lower than the Ministry of Finance's September 2024 outlook, which projected the 2024 deficit would widen to 2.7% of GDP. The better‑than‑outlook performance was supported by easing oil price pressure, commodity price recovery, low and stable inflation, and the recovery of the rupiah against the US dollar.\n\nAlthough the economy still grew, total tax revenue was the only APBN 2024 account that did not meet its target, mainly due to a contraction in tax receipts in the first half of 2024. This result was pressured by a significant decline in corporate income tax (PPh badan) (‑18% YoY) caused by lower profitability of the coal and palm oil sectors as commodity prices moderated in H1 2024. On the other hand, transactional tax receipts grew solidly, such as PPh 21 (+21% YoY) and VAT/PPN‑BM (PPN/PPnBM) (+8.6% YoY), supported by wage and THR payments.\n\nIn the same briefing, Sri Mulyani also said the Ministry of Finance forecasts Indonesia’s 2024 economic growth to be around +5% YoY (vs. 2023: +5.05% YoY), in line with consensus estimates but lower than the government’s target of +5.2% YoY. BPS has not yet released 4Q24 growth data.\n\nFor 2025, the government targets a 2.53% of GDP deficit, with government spending (+8.1% YoY) expected to grow faster than state revenue (+5.7% YoY).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAlthough the 2025 deficit is projected to rise this year, it could be higher than the estimate due to the cancellation of the increase in the general sales tax (PPN) for goods and services and the launch of the 2025 stimulus package. However, the risk may ease if those policies generate positive consumer spending impacts, thereby still increasing total tax revenue.\n\nIn addition, the implementation of the Coretax system is also expected to boost overall tax receipts. Maintaining the budget deficit at a stable level could help keep the rupiah stable – especially amid global uncertainties such as geopolitics, Fed interest‑rate moves, and the new US administration’s policies.",
