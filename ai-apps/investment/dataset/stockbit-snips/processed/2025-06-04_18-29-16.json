      "title": "Danantara Invests US$5 Billion in 2025; Rumor of a Capital Injection for GIAA",
      "content": "Managing Director Finance BPI Danantara, Arief Budiman, said on Tuesday (6/3) that his party will disburse investments worth 5 billion US dollars or approximately 81 trillion rupiah until the end of 2025, which will be focused on 8 sectors. These funds were obtained from BUMN dividend receipts targeted to reach 120 trillion rupiah during 2025. The 8 sectors that will be the main focus of Danantara's investment are mineral downstreaming, new and renewable energy, digital infrastructure, healthcare services, financial services, infrastructure utilities, industrial estates, and food and agriculture. Arief explained that the selection of these sectors was based on considerations of their contribution to national economic growth and return opportunities. Arief also mentioned that aside from dividend reallocation, Danantara also hopes to obtain co-investment, whether in the form of funding, capability, or competitiveness that Indonesia does not yet possess. Arief's statement came amid news from Bloomberg that Danantara will inject capital of about 500 million US dollars or approximately 8.1 trillion rupiah to Garuda Indonesia ($GIAA). Bloomberg sources said that this capital injection is likely to occur in 2 stages, with an agreement on the initial stage possibly being reached as early as June or July 2025. Part of this capital injection is reported to be given to GIAA's subsidiary, Citilink, to restore the operations of more than a dozen of its fleet units in storage. If realized, this corporate action has the potential to become Danantara's first investment since its establishment in early 2025. Bloomberg sources also said that the government is considering transferring the control of Citilink to Pertamina, adding that discussions regarding this matter are still unclear and no decision has been made yet. Representatives of GIAA and Danantara declined to comment on this issue. Meanwhile, Pertamina told Bloomberg that the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) once had an idea to merge Pelita Air and Citilink, although there is currently no new information. Pelita Air itself is controlled by Pertamina. The issue regarding the transfer of Citilink's control is new information, considering the government has been planning the consolidation of Pelita Air with GIAA and Citilink since 2023. Previously, Minister of BUMN, Erick Thohir, said in January 2025 that the consolidation of GIAA, Pelita Air, and Citilink is targeted to be completed within 6 months.",
