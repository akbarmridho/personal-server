      "content": "1. Reuters reported that China and India, the world’s largest thermal coal importers, have reduced imports of Indonesian thermal coal and are shifting to higher-calorie coal from other countries because the global coal price decline makes high-calorie coal more competitive. Vasudev Pamnani, director of I-Energy Natural Resources, said high-calorie coal can generate more energy per US dollar despite a higher price per ton. He estimated that one million tons of high-calorie coal could replace 1.2-1.5 million tons of Indonesian coal. Analyst Zhiyuan Li of Kpler noted that medium- and low-calorie Indonesian thermal coal is now competing with discounted Russian supply of the same calorific value. Kpler recorded that Indonesia’s thermal coal export volume fell 12% YoY to 187 million tons in the first five months of 2025.\n2. Reuters reported that the Indonesian government plans to introduce a new regulation requiring e-commerce platforms to collect a sales tax from sellers. The tax rate would be 0.5% of seller revenue for sellers with annual turnover between 500 million rupiah and 4.8 billion rupiah. The measure aims to boost state revenue and level the playing field between online and offline stores. The regulation could be announced as early as next month, but e-commerce platforms oppose it. The Ministry of Finance declined to comment, and the Indonesian E-Commerce Association (idEA) neither confirmed nor denied the report.\n3. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the government remains committed to fiscal discipline while implementing President Prabowo Subianto’s priority programs. She projected the 2025 state budget deficit to reach 2.5% of GDP as targeted and indicated that additional policies will be introduced to stimulate consumption, investment, and trade to achieve the 5.2% YoY economic growth target for the year.\n4. Labour Minister Yassierli said that as of 24 June 2025, the wage subsidy program (BSU) had been disbursed to 2.45 million workers, about 14% of the total target. The low uptake is due to multi-step verification and validation processes. The government aims to reach 17.3 million workers earning below 3.5 million rupiah per month, with a subsidy of 300,000 rupiah per month for June and July 2025.\n5. PT PLN reported electricity sales grew 6.17% YoY in 2024 to 17.78 TWh. PT Pertamina Patra Niaga reported retail, corporate and subsidiary fuel sales rose 5.6% YoY in 2024 to 105 million kiloliters.\n6. DNET CEO Haliman Kustedjo said the company has long considered taking PT Indomarco Prismatama (operator of the Indomaret retail network) public on the IDX, but an IPO is not expected in 2025. The company is still evaluating Indomaret’s financial condition before proceeding.",

      "title": "BMRI 5M25: Net Profit Flat YoY",
      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded a net profit for the bank-only entity of 4.5 trillion rupiah in May 2025, down 2% YoY but up 26% MoM. This result makes the net profit for the first five months of 2025 (5M25) 19.7 trillion rupiah, a 0% YoY change, roughly in line with consensus expectations that projected a flat consolidated net profit for 2025F (+0.3% YoY).\\nMonth-by-month, BMRI performance improved in May 2025 after the Lebaran holiday. The overall 5M25 performance, which generally resembles 1Q25, indicates that 2Q25 trends will not differ much from 1Q25, except for a potentially significant change in June 2025.\\nNon-Interest Income (Non-II) grew 6% YoY in May 2025, leading to a 13% YoY increase for the 5M25 period. Meanwhile, Net Interest Income (NII) slipped 1% YoY in May 2025 and grew only 4% YoY over 5M25.\\nThe weak NII performance was mainly caused by a sharp rise in interest expense amid tight liquidity conditions. This is reflected in the Net Interest Margin (NIM), which was low at 4.39% in May 2025 and averaged 4.45% for 5M25 (vs. 4.86% in 5M24 and 4.46% in 1Q25). The 5M25 NIM is also below the 2025 guidance from management after adjusting for bank-only versus consolidated figures.\\nCompared with 1Q25, the annual growth rates of Non-II and NII over 5M25 are not far apart. In 1Q25, Non-II and NII grew 15% YoY and 6% YoY respectively.\\nOperating expenses (Opex) rose 6% YoY in May 2025, resulting in a 22% YoY increase for the 5M25 period. This increase offset income growth, causing Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) to be flat, down 1% YoY both in May 2025 and over 5M25.\\nProvision expenses increased 7% YoY in May 2025 but fell 6% YoY over 5M25. The reduction in provisions is reflected in a lower Cost of Credit (CoC) of 0.7% for 5M25 (vs. 0.87% in 5M24), also below the 2025 guidance after the bank-only adjustment.\\nKey Takeaway: Liquidity remains a major challenge, so any easing could be a positive catalyst for BMRI. Market expectations have already priced in most performance pressure, as consensus has cut the 2025F consolidated net profit estimate by 3%-9% over the past three to six months. As of Wednesday 25 June, BMRI traded at a valuation of 1.46x 1-Year Forward P/BV, nearly touching one standard deviation (1.42x) below the five-year historical average. At this level, BMRI offers a potential dividend yield of at least about 7%.",
