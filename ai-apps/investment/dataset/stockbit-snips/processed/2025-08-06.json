The Chairman of the OJK Board of Commissioners, Mahendra Siregar, said that the regulator together with the banking sector and capital market is finalising a financing scheme for the operational implementation of the Free Nutritious Meal program. The scheme will cover operational financing, refinancing, and financing for future capacity expansion. Mahendra indicated that the implementation could start soon. 2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, denied allegations of data manipulation regarding Indonesia's 2Q25 economic growth, which reached +5.12% year-on-year. His statement came after the BPS data surpassed the consensus estimate of +4.8% YoY. Digital Economy Center Director Nailul Huda argued that the BPS data contain anomalies because they are not consistent with leading indicators such as the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which fell to 46.9 in June 2025 (vs. 47.4 in May 2025), indicating a contraction in factory activity. 3. A residential property price survey from Bank Indonesia showed that residential property price growth slowed to +0.9% YoY in 2Q25 (vs. +1.76% YoY in 2Q24 and +1.07% YoY in 1Q25). Residential property sales in 2Q25 contracted -3.8% YoY (vs. +7.3% YoY in 2Q24 and +0.73% YoY in 1Q25) due to a sharp decline in medium-type house sales (-17.69% YoY, vs. +3.01% YoY in 2Q24 and -35.76% YoY in 1Q25) and large-type house sales (-14.95% YoY, vs. +27.41% YoY in 2Q24 and -11.69% YoY in 1Q25), while small-type house sales grew +6.7% YoY (vs. +4.51% YoY in 2Q24 and +21.75% YoY in 1Q25). 4. The government, together with the DPR and a logistics drivers association, agreed to target over-dimension over-loading (ODOL) trucks starting in 2027, postponing the originally planned 2026 implementation.",

      "title": "TLKM 2Q25 Earnings Call: The Worst Might Be Over",
      "content": "Management of Telkom Indonesia (TLKM) held the 2Q25 earnings call on Tuesday (5 August) afternoon. Key points: Revision of 2025 Guidance – Following weak performance in 1H25, TLKM management decided to revise the revenue growth guidance for 2025 from low-single digit to flat. The softer top-line target also leads to lowering the EBITDA margin expectation from the initial range of 50-52% to 50% (vs 1H25: 49.5%). To achieve this, TLKM needs to record revenue of approximately 77 trillion rupiah in 2H25, up from 1H25 realization of about 73 trillion rupiah (+5.4%) and 2H24 of about 74.7 trillion rupiah (+3%). We consider this target achievable, given several positive catalysts for TLKM’s future performance. Trend of Declining ARPU Easing – TLKM management predicts that the decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) in the mobile segment to the level of 41.2 thousand rupiah has peaked, supported by factors: 1) launch of a 35-thousand-rupiah starter pack for 3 GB (previously 24 thousand for 6 GB) and termination of Telkomsel Lite and prepaid programs; 2) product simplification from 6 000 SKUs to 400 SKUs; and 3) remaining cheap starter-pack inventory from the intense competition period of 3Q24-1Q25 is expected to be exhausted by the end of August 2025. Looking ahead, TLKM expects rising consumer purchasing power, so data payload – an indicator of consumption – will increase even if selling prices rise. FiberCo Business Strategy Preparation – Following the establishment of Infranexia (PT Telkom Infrastruktur Indonesia) as a fiber infrastructure entity, management plans a first-phase spin-off in 4Q25 with a target of transferring more than 50% of TLKM’s total fiber assets and selected fiber business to PT Telkom Infrastruktur Indonesia. Additionally, management is reviewing several fiber assets currently used only internally to open access to external parties, thereby increasing fiber utilization. However, TLKM is still assessing the impact of external fiber access on the IndiHome business. We believe this move can increase competition in the fixed broadband segment, both from service providers and infrastructure providers. Key Takeaway – After the 1H25 performance decline, TLKM’s share price strengthened by 3.8% from 2,880 rupiah per share at Thursday (31 July) close to 2,990 rupiah per share on Wednesday (6 August). The expectation that the worst performance has been passed in 2Q25 and will improve thereafter is viewed positively by the market. The recovery progress, indicated by rising ARPU and stabilizing subscriber numbers, should be closely monitored by investors as it will be a key factor determining TLKM’s stock price recovery.",
