      "title": "Sektor Properti: Kompilasi Marketing Sales 9M25",
      "content": "Several residential property developers announced their 9M25 marketing sales results, including Ciputra Development ($CTRA), Summarecon Agung ($SMRA), Alam Sutera Realty ($ASRI), and Pakuwon Jati ($PWON). SMRA recorded the highest marketing-sales growth in 9M25 (+34% YoY), achieving 71% of the 2025 marketing-sales target, better than 9M24 (61% in 2024). The surge is attributed to the launch of a new product in Summarecon Serpong in 2Q25. CTRA achieved the highest target realization at 76%; in October 2025 CTRA revised the 2025 target down to IDR 10 trillion from IDR 11 trillion (2024 actual 11 trillion). ASRI and PWON realized 60% and 50% of the 2025 target respectively, down from 73% in 9M24 for both. The 9M25 marketing-sales occurred amid a 100% value-added tax (PPN DTP) incentive. The incentive, originally set to end in June 2025 and to be reduced to 50% for July-December 2025, was extended to remain at 100% for July-December 2025, and in October 2025 the Finance Minister announced the 100% incentive would be extended to 2027. During 9M25, PWON contributed the highest share of PPN DTP-eligible sales (73.3% of total marketing-sales). SMRA has not released its PPN DTP contribution data. A chart (Weekly_2025-10-21_19-01-48.png) shows ASRI and PWON share prices on the left y-axis, SMRA, BSDE and CTRA on the outer right y-axis, and the BI Rate (IDBIRRPO Index) on the inner right y-axis, with a 40-week lag applied to the rate to reflect expectation effects. Key takeaway: marketing-sales outlook depends more on consumer purchasing power than further rate cuts, as mortgage rates are already low and sticky (average bank mortgage rate fell from 6.91% in Dec-2024 to 6.84% in Jun-2025, while the BI Rate has fallen 125 bps YTD). Historical chart suggests lower rates could still boost property-sector share prices.",
