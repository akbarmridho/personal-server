      "title": "DPR Suggests Lower Cigarette Excise Hike, Gradual Increase for Packaged Sweetened Beverages",
      "content": "The House of Representatives (DPR) recommends that the excise tax rate (CHT) for machine-made white cigarettes (SPM) and machine-made kretek cigarettes (SKM) increase by a minimum of +5% per year in 2025 and 2026. This proposal is lower compared to the average CHT rate hike of 10% in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the DPR recommends a limited increase for hand-rolled kretek cigarettes (SKT) CHT in 2025 and 2026, taking into account labor absorption. Besides CHT, the DPR also proposes a minimum excise tax rate for packaged sweetened beverages (MBDK) of 2.5% in 2025, which will be gradually increased up to 20%. This proposal differs from the draft circulated previously, where the considered MBDK excise tax rate was 1,771 Rupiah per liter, in line with the average MBDK excise tax rate in Southeast Asian countries. The latest MBDK excise discourse does not list the criteria for MBDK products subject to excise. However, in the previous draft, MBDK products subject to excise were: 1) MBDK products without sweetening food additives with a sugar content of more than 6 grams per 100 ml; and 2) MBDK products containing natural or artificial sweetening food additives at any level. The DPR's proposals for CHT rates and MBDK excise are still only recommendations, with the final decision resting with the Minister of Finance in the new government cabinet. The government itself targets excise revenue of 244.2 trillion Rupiah in the 2025 State Budget Draft (RAPBN), an increase of +5.93% compared to the 2024 outlook of 230.5 trillion Rupiah. Key Takeaway: A lower CHT rate hike going forward has the potential to be a breath of fresh air for the cigarette industry, which has been burdened by continuous high tariff hikes in recent years. Responding to the news, the stock prices of HMSP and WIIM strengthened by +2.72% and +2.05% respectively on Wednesday (11/9), while GGRM slightly decreased by -0.16%. Meanwhile, the gradual implementation of MBDK excise tax rates has the potential to provide relief for consumer companies to adapt in their efforts to maintain demand volume and/or profitability. This is because the previous MBDK excise tax discourse of 1,711 Rupiah per liter was feared to trigger a significant increase in selling prices to compensate for the excise burden.",

      "title": "Government Budget Draft Revised, Oil Prices Drop, Retail Sales Contract, Property Sector Concerns, Nuclear Power Committee Planned, Sinarmas Group Data Center, Tourism Bill Postponed",
      "content": "The Director at the Ministry of Finance, Isa Rachmatarwata, said on Tuesday (9/10) that the budget for ministries or agencies in 2025 will increase significantly to 1,160.08 trillion Rupiah, up from the 976.78 trillion Rupiah budget in the 2025 State Budget Draft (RAPBN). This announcement came just one day after the Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, presented the results of the 2025 RAPBN discussion to the elected president, Prabowo Subianto, on Monday (8/10). Isa confirmed that this budget increase will not cause the budget deficit to widen, as the funds are merely shifted from non-ministry/agency budgets. In the new budget, the 5 ministries or agencies with the largest budgets are the Ministry of Defense (166.26 trillion Rupiah), the National Police (126.62 trillion Rupiah), the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (116.22 trillion Rupiah), the Ministry of Health (105.6 trillion Rupiah), and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (93 trillion Rupiah). Brent oil prices fell -3.69% to 69.19 US Dollars per barrel in Tuesday (10/9) night trading, marking the lowest level since December 2021. This decline occurred after OPEC+ revised down its 2024 oil demand growth projection from 2.11 million barrels per day to 2.03 million barrels per day. Furthermore, OPEC+ also revised down its 2025 oil demand growth projection from 1.78 million barrels per day to 1.74 million barrels per day. This downward revision was influenced by lower oil demand from China - the world's largest oil importer - amid economic slowdown and the shift towards cleaner fuels. Bank Indonesia noted that retail sales in Indonesia in July 2024 contracted by -7.2% Month-over-Month (MoM), but grew +4.5% Year-over-Year (YoY) (vs. June 2024: +0.4% MoM and +2.7% YoY). Bank Indonesia stated that the monthly decline was caused by demand normalization post-Eid al-Adha. For August 2024, Bank Indonesia estimates retail sales to grow +1.6% MoM and +5.8% YoY. Senior Vice President of Marketing at Rumah123, Bharat Buxani, stated that he hopes the government can postpone the increase in VAT from 11% to 12% for 6 months to 1 year because it has the potential to slow down growth in the property sector. Buxani mentioned that now is not the right time to raise the VAT rate, considering public purchasing power is on a declining trend. The Jakarta Post reported that the Indonesian government plans to announce the Executive Committee for the Nuclear Energy Program next week. The committee will be chaired by the president and run by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, aimed at supervising and accelerating nuclear power project development in Indonesia. According to the National Research and Innovation Agency, Indonesia targets to test and operate the first commercial Nuclear Power Plant (PLTN) between 2030-2034. Katadata reported that the Sinarmas group will build a data center worth 300 million US Dollars or 4.7 trillion Rupiah in Kuningan, South Jakarta in 1Q25. The data center will be built through a joint venture with LG CNS Co., Ltd, namely PT LG Sinarmas. The project is scheduled for completion in 3Q26 and start operating in 4Q26. The President Director of PT LG Sinarmas, Han Dong-Hyup, claimed that this facility is the first AI-operated data center in Indonesia, with the majority of clients coming from the banking sector affiliated with the Sinarmas group or investors from South Korea. The Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, Sandiaga Uno, stated that the discussion of the Tourism Bill will be postponed and continued by the next government and DPR. Sandiaga mentioned that this decision was made so that the aspirations of tourism business actors can be accommodated well in the draft regulation. Previously, the Indonesian Tourism Industry Association requested that the discussion of the Tourism Bill be postponed because it was not yet in line with the aspirations of tourism actors.",
