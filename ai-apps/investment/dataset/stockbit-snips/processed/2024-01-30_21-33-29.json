      "title": "Toyota: Still the World's Best Seller, but New Scandal Emerges",
      "content": "Toyota Motor Corp. (TYO: 7203) on Monday (29/1) announced it will temporarily halt shipments for 10 car models due to diesel engine certification issues. The problem arose after an investigative committee found that the affected models had differences in horsepower output and Engine Control Unit (ECU) devices compared to those used during the certification test. Based on a release from Toyota Motor Corp., one of the affected car models is the Toyota Fortuner produced by PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia (TMMIN). Responding to this issue, TMMIN Vice President Director, Bob Azam, claimed that this case is not related to cars in Indonesia. Bob explained that the problem relates to certification procedures in several countries other than Indonesia. Bob also stated that the issue is neither related to nor affects vehicle safety and the amount of emissions produced by the vehicles. Toyota's diesel engine certification issue occurred just a month after the scandal involving its subsidiary, Daihatsu Motor Co., which was proven to have manipulated safety tests for 64 car models. As a result, Daihatsu will stop shipments and halt operations at least until February 2024. Amidst these scandals, Toyota Motor Corp. announced that its global sales realization reached 11.2 million vehicles in 2023, a growth of +7.2% YoY. This realization makes Toyota the world's best-selling car manufacturer for 4 consecutive years. Sales of Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles reached 10.3 million vehicles in 2023. Of this figure, sales of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) for Toyota experienced a significant increase of +31.4% YoY to 3.4 million units, while sales of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) only reached 104 thousand units. For comparison, Toyota's competitors in the BEV segment - namely BYD and Tesla - recorded battery electric vehicle sales of 1.57 million units (+72.8% YoY) and 1.81 million units (+38% YoY) respectively during 2023.",

      "content": "The issue adds negative sentiment to ASII shares, which have been under selling pressure in the last month due to the Daihatsu safety scandal issue and the entry of BYD into Indonesia. Nevertheless, we assess that the impact of this issue on ASII's finances will be minimal, considering the contribution of Toyota Fortuner is only about ~3% of ASII's total domestic sales in 2023. The potential impact from the export side is also relatively small, considering ASII only has ~5% ownership in TMMIN. On the other hand, the popularity of Toyota's Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) sales also occurs in Indonesia. We assess that this trend can help ASII maintain market share amidst increasing competition in the electric car segment. On Tuesday (30/1), ASII shares strengthened +3.45% to the level of 5,100/share, but have weakened -9.73% in the last 1 month.",
