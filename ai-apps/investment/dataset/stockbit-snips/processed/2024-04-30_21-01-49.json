      "title": "ASII 1Q24: Resilient Performance Thanks to Diversification; Final Dividend of Rp421/Share Approved",
      "content": "Astra International ($ASII) recorded a net profit of 7.5 trillion rupiah (-14.4% YoY, -8.4% QoQ) in 1Q24, equivalent to 24.1% of the consensus FY24 estimate. Although appearing below expectations, the low net profit was also caused by the impairment of investment in Medikaloka Hermina ($HEAL) and GoTo Gojek Tokopedia ($GOTO). If the investment impairment is set aside, ASII's net profit in 1Q24 remained at a quite resilient level of 8.1 trillion rupiah, equivalent to 26.3% of the consensus FY24 estimate and in line with expectations. Based on segments, Automotive and United Tractors ($UNTR) suppressed ASII's performance, while Financial Services became the main support. Here is the detail: Automotive - Operating profit fell -45.8% YoY, although it improved quarterly. The decline in operating profit was caused by an increase in cost of sales (+4.7% YoY) and general and administrative expenses (+8.3% YoY), even though revenue remained relatively stable (+0% YoY, +17.6% QoQ). Management explained that the success in maintaining revenue - even though ASII's car sales volume dropped -20% YoY - was due to increased sales of cars with more premium selling prices, such as the Innova Zennix and Yaris Cross. UNTR - Operating profit fell -8.5% YoY and -22.6% QoQ, driven by weakness in the heavy equipment sales and coal mining segments. Meanwhile, the mining contractor segment recorded good performance and became the support for UNTR's performance. Financial Services - Operating profit grew +19.1% YoY and +5.0% QoQ, driven by strong consumer financing in the car, motorcycle, and heavy equipment segments. In addition to the Financial Services business, ASII's performance was also supported by the relatively solid performance of associated entities and joint ventures (JV). Net profit from associated entities and JVs still managed to grow to 2.6 trillion rupiah (+5.2% YoY, +16.0% QoQ), supported by an increase in the net profit of PT Astra Honda Motor to 2.4 trillion rupiah (+4.0% YoY). Key Takeaway: We assess ASII's performance in 1Q24 as quite good. Amidst sluggish automotive sales, ASII's net profit excluding impairment dropped only -5% YoY. The positive performance recorded by the Financial Services segment, Mining Contractors (under UNTR), and associated entities and JVs successfully supported ASII, which is a positive note. This 1Q24 performance demonstrates ASII's stability thanks to its diversified business. Furthermore, we also assess that various bad news has been reflected in ASII's stock price, so the risk of further downside appears limited. With a low valuation (7x 1-Year Forward P/E), we assess that ASII offers an attractive risk-reward. Additionally, at the GMS today, Tuesday (30/4), ASII shareholders also approved the payment of a final dividend of 421 rupiah per share, indicating a final dividend yield of 8.2%.",
