      "content": "The State-owned Banks Association (Himbara) – consisting of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), and Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) – announced on Wednesday, 24 September 2025 that they will raise the counter-rate US-dollar deposit interest to 4% per annum effective 5 November 2025. The increase applies to all balance categories and all tenors up to 12 months. The move follows Finance Minister Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa’s statement on Friday, 19 September that the government is preparing a market-based incentive scheme to encourage owners of US-dollar deposits to place their funds domestically, aiming to strengthen the national foreign-exchange reserves, increase the supply of US dollars in the banking system, and facilitate financing of strategic government projects. The policy is expected to support the rupiah, which had depreciated to IDR 16,676 per US$ on Wednesday, 24 September, the weakest level since April 2025. The recent weakening of the rupiah over the past week was mainly driven by negative sentiment regarding (1) the weakening independence of Bank Indonesia and (2) the potential increase in government debt (deficit) to spur economic growth. Meanwhile, the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS) lowered the maximum interest rate on foreign-currency deposits guaranteed at conventional banks by 25 basis points to 2%, and lowered the maximum interest rate on rupiah deposits guaranteed at conventional banks by 25 basis points to 3.5%.",
