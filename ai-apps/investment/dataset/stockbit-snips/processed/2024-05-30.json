      "title": "BYD Launches New Hybrid Vehicle, Risk for ASII",
      "content": "BYD announced the launch of a new plug-in hybrid (PHEV) vehicle equipped with the latest DM 5.0 technology, which the company claims achieves a fuel consumption of 2.9 liters per 100 km (equivalent to 34.5 km per liter), compared with the previous DM 4.0 version that consumes 3.8 liters per 100 km (26.3 km per liter). The DM 5.0 version is priced from 99.8 thousand yuan (approximately IDR 220 million), while the DM 4.0 version starts at 79.8 thousand yuan (approximately IDR 180 million). The price could be higher in Indonesia due to import duties and luxury vehicle tax (PPnBM).\n\nThere is currently no information on whether the PHEV DM 5.0 models (Qin L sedan and Seal 06 sedan) will be sold in Indonesia, as even the DM 4.0 models (Qin Plus DM-i sedan and Song Plus DM-i SUV) have not yet entered the Indonesian market. However, BYD officially entered Indonesia earlier this year and has purchased land in Subang, so the company could launch its PHEV models in Indonesia in the future, likely beginning with the DM 4.0 version.\n\nAt the IIMS 2024 exhibition, BYD’s products received a positive response, with the number of vehicle order letters (SPK) reaching more than 1,000 units (Toyota recorded 762 units and Wuling 799 units).\n\nTo date, BYD sells three battery-electric vehicle (BEV) models in Indonesia: the Dolphin SUV, the Atto 3 SUV and the Seal sedan, priced respectively from IDR 425 million, IDR 515 million and IDR 629 million.\n\nThe hybrid-vehicle segment in Indonesia is growing rapidly, with ASII holding a market-share of up to 72.5 % for FY 2023.\n\nKey Takeaway: Because BYD’s hybrid models are priced considerably lower, their entry could negatively affect ASII’s hybrid market share. ASII’s hybrid models – the Innova Zenix Hybrid (fuel consumption 18.8 km per liter) and the Yaris Cross Hybrid (27 km per liter) – are priced higher, starting at IDR 430 million and IDR 367 million respectively. Hybrid vehicles contributed about 7 % of ASII’s total vehicle sales in FY 2023.",

The upward shift is driven by strong Q1 2024 GDP data and policy measures taken by the Chinese government. The IMF, however, projects China’s growth to slow to only 3.3 % by 2029, constrained by an ageing population and a slowdown in productivity expansion.",

By the end of 2023, only 13 countries – including the United States, India and China – had adopted renewable-energy policies for buildings, industry, transport and agriculture, accounting for just 12.7 % of total energy consumption. Of the 69 countries that have end-user renewable-energy targets, only 17 have extended those targets beyond 2024.",
