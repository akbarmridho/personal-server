      "title": "Wholesales Mobil +2% YoY di Feb-25, Pertama sejak Jun-23",
      "content": "Gaikindo notes that national car wholesales in February 2025 reached 72,295 units (+2.2% YoY, +17% MoM), marking the first annual growth since June 2023. This result brings national car wholesale sales for 2M25 to 134,144 units (-4.5% YoY), equivalent to 15-18% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 2M24: 16.2% of 2024 realization). Here are some highlights of car sales in February 2025: Astra International's main two brands - Toyota + Daihatsu - recorded a decline in annual sales performance (-5.8% YoY, +13% MoM) in February 2025, worse than the industry realization (+2.2% YoY, +17% MoM), causing their combined market share to drop to 50.3% in February 2025 (vs. February 2024: 54.6%, January 2025: 51.8%). Cumulatively over 2M25, Toyota + Daihatsu wholesales were recorded at 68,421 (-7.5% YoY), worse than the industry decline (-4.5% YoY), so their combined market share for 2M25 fell to 51% (vs. 2M24: 52.6%, 1M25: 51.8%). Among ASII's top 3 main competitors, Mitsubishi recorded the most positive performance with wholesales reaching 8,790 units in February 2025 (+6.6% YoY, +23% MoM), causing its market share to rise to 12.2% (vs. February 2024: 11.6%, January 2025: 11.5%). Meanwhile, Suzuki booked a sales decline to 4,750 units (-4.9% YoY, -4.7% MoM), but the decline level was still better than Toyota + Daihatsu. Wuling and Chery recorded sales surges of +61% YoY and +241% YoY respectively in February 2025. Chery's sales of 1,468 units in February 2025 are the highest since the brand entered Indonesia, driven by the launch of the Tiggo Cross at the 2025 Indonesia International Motor Show (IIMS). Meanwhile, BYD's sales were recorded at 1,399 units, relatively stable compared to the average of the last 2 months. We assess that the relatively good sales volume - enabling YoY growth - was driven by solid IIMS 2025 sales and a slight seasonal demand increase related to Eid al-Fitr shifting to February 2025. IIMS 2025 itself was deemed successful, recording a sales volume increase of +16% YoY to 22,322 units. In our view, the success of IIMS 2025 indicates that consumers are responding to the new models launched, which can support the recovery of national car sales this year.",

However, Sudirman said that Indonesia does not fully possess the technology for coal gasification into DME, so it still needs to rely on foreign investment that already has this technology. Previously, in 2023, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, said that the DME project did not require foreign investors. In 2023, foreign investor Air Products and Chemicals Inc. withdrew from the DME project with Bukit Asam. The DME project is reportedly to be funded by the Danantara Investment Management Agency with a cost of 11 billion US dollars, equivalent to approximately 27.5% of the total investment for the 21 downstreaming projects to be funded by the agency.",
