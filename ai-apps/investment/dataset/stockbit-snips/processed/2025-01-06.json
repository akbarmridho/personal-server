      "title": "Uncertainty Over HGBT Incentive and Its Impact on Gas‑Intensive Industries",
      "content": "The Chairman of the Association of Ceramic Industry (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, said that there is still no continuation regarding the specific natural gas price incentive (HGBT) worth USD 6.5 per MMBtu, which ended on 31 December 2024. According to a report by Tempo, the termination of the HGBT policy caused the price of gas used below the industrial gas allocation limit (AGIT) to rise from USD 6.5 per MMBtu to a commercial price above USD 10 per MMBtu.\n\nEdy also stated that Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) increased the surcharge for industries using gas above the AGIT by +21.08%, from USD 13.85 per MMBtu to USD 16.77 per MMBtu for the period 1 January–31 March 2025.\n\nEdy explained that the HGBT incentive initially reduced the gas cost component from 28‑30% of total ceramic production costs to a level of 23‑26%. However, gas supply disruptions in West and East Java since 2023, together with the surcharge of USD 13.85 per MMBtu that has been in place since May 2024, have pushed the gas cost component back above 30% of ceramic production costs.\n\nEdy has sent a letter to President Prabowo Subianto to save the national ceramic industry after foreign investors in Asaki said they would halt investment due to legal uncertainty. PGAS has not commented on the surcharge or the gas supply disruption.\n\nEnergy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said on Friday (3 January) that the HGBT incentive is under evaluation. In December 2024, Acting Director General of Oil and Gas, Dadan Kusdiana, signaled that the HGBT policy would be continued in 2025 at a similar price, around USD 6 per MMBtu. Dadan also said the ministry received a recommendation from the Ministry of Industry to add 15 new sub‑sectors as HGBT recipients. Previously, HGBT recipients were limited to seven sectors: ceramics, fertilizer, petrochemicals, oleochemicals, steel, glass, and rubber gloves.\n\nKey Takeaway: PGAS could enjoy higher margins with the end of the HGBT incentive in early 2025 and the surcharge increase. Conversely, higher gas prices will negatively affect industries with a high gas‑energy cost component, although the impact is expected to be short‑term as the HGBT policy is still under government discussion.\n\nBased on the market close on Monday (6 January), PGAS shares rose +7.52%, while several gas‑sensitive stocks moved mixed: $TPIA (‑5.23%), $ARNA (‑1.45%), $MARK (‑0.46%), $AMFG (+1.16%), $CAKK (+1.34%).",

The value of the cooperation has not been disclosed and will be negotiated.\n\nWintermar Offshore Marine (WINS) said it targets fleet utilization of 75% in 2025, up from 68% in 2024, as several drilling projects in Indonesia have not yet started, such as the Masela and Andaman blocks.
