      "title": "Investor Qatar Enters 1 Million Home Programme",
      "content": "The Indonesian government signed a memorandum of understanding with Qatar‑based investor Qilaa International Group on Wednesday, 8 January 2025, to build one million affordable homes for low‑income urban residents. The programme is part of the administration’s goal of constructing three million homes per year under President Prabowo Subianto’s government. Under the agreement, the government will provide land for apartment construction, prioritising the regions of Jakarta, Banten and West Java, while Qilaa International Group will act as contractor and finance the projects. The financial size and duration of the partnership have not been disclosed. In December 2024, Hashim Djojohadikusumo – head of the Housing Task Force and brother of President Prabowo – said the United Arab Emirates would also cooperate to build one million affordable homes. The announcement came one day after Housing and Settlement Minister Maruarar Sirait said he was discussing with President Prabowo and the Housing Savings Management Agency (BP Tapera) a revision of the Tapera contribution from mandatory to voluntary. Under the existing regulation, the Tapera contribution is mandatory for all workers earning above the minimum wage as of 20 May 2027, at a rate of 3 % of monthly earnings. It remains unclear whether the minister’s statement implies a future amendment of the Tapera rule. Maruarar added that the government is awaiting a Constitutional Court decision on a public lawsuit against the existing Tapera regulation. The sustainable funding from the Qatar investor could support the housing programme, potentially reducing reliance on Tapera funds. Greater certainty of the housing programme could positively affect supporting sectors such as cement ($SMGR, $INTP), ceramics ($ARNA, $CAKK) and home‑appliance makers ($ACES, $MDIY, $TOTO). Conversely, the possibility of making the Tapera contribution voluntary could ease pressure on households’ discretionary income, potentially boosting overall consumer purchasing power.",
