      "title": "US Does Not Change Tariff for Indonesia at 32%",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on Monday local time (7/7) [link] set a tariff of 32% for products originating from Indonesia, unchanged from the initial tariff announced in April 2025 [link]. Spokesperson for the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Haryo Limanseto, stated that the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, is scheduled to arrive in the US on Tuesday (8/7) to meet with US government representatives to discuss Trump's tariff decision for Indonesia. The US government will only implement the new tariff on August 1, 2025, postponed from the previously set deadline of July 9, 2025. Trump also [said] that the August 1, 2025 deadline is 'not 100% certain', signaling that the US government is still open to further negotiations. The tariff for Indonesia remains unchanged even though the government has offered a package worth 34 billion US dollars for investment and the import of goods [link] from the US, which includes the purchase of 1 million tons of US wheat per year in the 2026-2030 period and energy purchases worth 15.5 billion US dollars. Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, [said] that the decision to import energy from the US will be postponed until the final negotiation results. Previously [link], Airlangga hoped that Indonesia could reach a lower tariff agreement compared to Vietnam, considering the value of the package offered by Indonesia. Last week, the US lowered tariffs on Vietnamese imported products from 46% to 20%, while goods from other countries transported via Vietnam were subject to a 40% tariff. In [his letter] to President Prabowo Subianto, Trump mentioned that the 32% tariff on Indonesia is not even enough to eliminate the trade deficit disparity, which he claims is caused by tariffs, non-tariffs, and trade barriers implemented by Indonesia. Furthermore, Trump threatened that if Indonesia imposes retaliatory tariffs on the US, the US will add a similar amount to the tariff for Indonesia on top of the existing 32% tariff. Responding to this development, the IHSG closed up 0.05% today, Tuesday (8/7), with the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar strengthening by +0.14% to the level of 16,208 Rupiah and the 10-year government bond yield rising by +0.9 bps to the level of 6.589%.",

      "content": "Generally, the reaction of Asian markets was muted in today's trading, including Indonesia. Besides the Rupiah, the majority of Asian emerging market currencies even strengthened today against the US Dollar, such as the South Korean Won (+0.57%) and the Thai Baht (+0.14%). This may indicate that market participants still have optimism that this decision is not final and an agreement can still be reached before August 1, 2025. For Indonesia itself, we assess that the risk of failure to reach a trade agreement (relative to competitor countries) could put pressure on Indonesian exports, so economic growth will become increasingly dependent on domestic factors - primarily government spending - in the context of recent economic developments.",

      "content": "1. Reuters [link] reported that the US government will not immediately impose an additional 10% tariff on BRICS member countries. Reuters sources said that the additional tariff will only be imposed if the BRICS member countries adopt policies deemed 'anti-American.' The Reuters report emerged after President Donald Trump on Sunday (6/7) threatened to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country allied with the 'BRICS anti-American policy,' without further elaboration. BRICS agreed last weekend to continue talks on a cross-border payment system for trade and investment. 2. China on Tuesday (8/7) warned the US government not to reignite trade tensions, and [threatened] retaliation against countries that make deals with the US to remove China from global trade supply chains. 3. The Secretary General of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (GAPKI), Hadi Sugeng, [said] that Indonesian palm oil exports to the US could fall by about 15-20% due to the 32% tariff imposed by the US on products originating from Indonesia. Hadi explained that the average Indonesian palm oil export reached 2.25 million metric tons per year in the last 3 years. During 2024, Indonesia exported 29.5 million tons of palm oil products to the global market. Indonesian palm oil products - which account for 85% of US palm oil imports - may lose market share to Malaysian palm oil, considering Malaysia is subject to a lower tariff of 25%. Furthermore, Hadi mentioned that the competitiveness of Indonesian palm oil will also decrease against other vegetable oils - such as soybean oil and rapeseed oil - especially if those vegetable oil exporting countries receive lower tariffs. 4. The Government and Commission XI of the House of Representatives [agreed] on the discourse of expanding the state revenue base in 2026 through the imposition of export duties on coal and gold products. Deputy Chairman of Commission XI of the DPR, Fauzi H Amro, stated that the amount of the export duty tariff will be proposed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to the Ministry of Finance. Currently, raw gold products or dore bullion are already subject to export duties in accordance with Finance Ministerial Regulation No. 38/2024, but gold bars and jewelry are not yet included in this object. Meanwhile, coal has not been subject to export duties since 2006 and is only subject to royalties as part of non-tax state revenue (PNBP). 5. Bank Indonesia [noted] that Indonesia's consumer confidence index increased to 117.8 in June 2025 (vs. May 2025: 117.5). Despite the increase, the consumer confidence index in June 2025 is still close to the May 2025 level, which is the lowest level since September 2022 along with weakening purchasing power and shrinking middle class.",
