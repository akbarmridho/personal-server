      "title": "US Inflation Meets Expectations, Fed Rate Cut Expectations Rise",
      "content": "US consumer price index (CPI) for November 2024 rose to 2.7 percent year‑on‑year and 0.3 percent month‑on‑month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm). This is higher than the October 2024 CPI of 2.6 percent YoY and 0.2 percent MoM, marking the highest monthly inflation in seven months and above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, yet both the annual and monthly rates were in line with consensus expectations. Following the data release, the market became more optimistic about a possible Fed rate cut at the December 2024 meeting, scheduled for next week. The CME FedWatch Tool shows the probability of a 25‑basis‑point cut at the December meeting rising from 73.8 percent on Wednesday (4/12) to 98.6 percent on Thursday (12/12). Conversely, the probability of a cut of 75 basis points or more by June 2025 fell from 53.5 percent on Wednesday to 48.1 percent on Thursday. On Wednesday (11/12) US equity markets were mixed: the Nasdaq gained 1.77 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.82 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.22 percent. Meanwhile, the 10‑year US Treasury yield increased by 4 basis points to 4.27 percent and the US dollar index (DXY) rose 0.29 percent to 106.71. Key Takeaway: Although expectations for a Fed rate cut in December have risen, the strengthening US dollar puts pressure on the Indonesian rupiah and may limit Bank Indonesia's ability to follow the Fed in cutting rates. Bank Indonesia said it is ready to intervene in the foreign‑exchange market to stabilise the rupiah, which is currently slightly below the psychological level of 16,000 per US dollar (source: https://emailer.stockbit.com/t/c/8646f3e7-d687-4632-a1ce-4594c943901c/6b66c67b-db5c-4c37-a454-acca3e13e648).",

The IEA expects global oil consumption to grow by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2025, a 1 percent year‑on‑year increase to 103.9 million barrels per day.
