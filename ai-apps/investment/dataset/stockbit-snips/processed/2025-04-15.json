      "title": "Car Sales -5% YoY in March 2025",
      "content": "Gaikindo reported that national wholesale car sales in March 2025 fell to 70,909 units (-5.1% YoY, -1.9% MoM), due to a shift in seasonality related to Lebaran and IIMS 2025. The result made wholesale car sales for the first three months of 2025 (3M25) reach 205,136 units (-4.7% YoY), roughly in line with expectations as it represents 23-27% of Gaikindo's 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 3M24: 25% of the 2024 realization). Highlights of March 2025 car sales: 1. Astra sales weak, although relatively better than other Japanese brands. Combined, the two main Astra International brands (Toyota + Daihatsu) recorded a sales decline (-5.7% YoY, -2.3% MoM) in March 2025, worse than the industry average (-5.1% YoY, -1.9% MoM), causing their combined market share to drop to 50.1% in March 2025 (vs. March 2024: 50.4%, February 2025: 50.3%). The drop was mainly driven by a 21% YoY decline in Daihatsu sales, while Toyota sales grew +6.3% YoY. Cumulatively for 3M25, Toyota + Daihatsu wholesale sales fell -6.9% YoY to 103,954 units, worse than the industry decline (-4.7% YoY), bringing their market share to 50.7% (vs. 3M24: 51.9%). Other Japanese brands weakened significantly in March 2025, with Honda and Suzuki each falling -40.4% YoY and -33.4% YoY respectively. Over 3M25, the two brands fell -20.4% YoY each. 2. Chinese brands continue to surge. BYD recorded sales of 3,205 units in March 2025 (+129% MoM), the highest level since BYD entered Indonesia and surpassing Hyundai sales. This raised BYD's market share to 4.5% in March 2025 (vs. February 2025: 1.9%). Chery posted its highest monthly sales of 1,829 units (+128% YoY, +25% MoM), continuing the trend seen in February 2025. Only Wuling showed a different trend compared to BYD and Chery. Key Takeaway: Combining February and March data to avoid distortion from Lebaran-related seasonality, car sales fell -1.6% YoY. Although weak, the realization is roughly in line with Gaikindo's expectation of stagnant 2025 car sales compared to 2024. The current stagnant market is being supported by the increasing contribution of Chinese brands, which erodes the market share of Japanese brands.",

      "content": "1. OPEC on Monday (14/4) cut its global oil demand growth forecast to 1.3 million barrels per day for 2025 and 1.28 million barrels per day for 2026, each 150,000 barrels per day lower than the previous projection. This is the first downgrade of oil demand growth since December 2024, driven by the escalation of the trade war due to US tariffs.\n2. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday (14/4) that the reduction of import income tax (PPh) and customs duties will apply generally, not only to US-origin products. He explained that the adjustment is part of deregulation measures to minimize negative impacts from US reciprocal tariffs. His statement differs from that of the Head of the Fiscal Policy Agency, Febrio Nathan Kacaribu, who said last week that the tax adjustments would apply only to US-origin products.\n3. The US government continues its plan to impose import tariffs on semiconductor and pharmaceutical commodities, launching a trade investigation led by the US Department of Commerce on Monday (14/4). The investigation, started on 1 April 2025, focuses on the national security impact of imported semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, pharmaceuticals, and finished drug products. Results are expected within 270 days, though US officials have indicated a desire for a faster resolution.\n4. Indonesian Minister of Communication and Digital Meutya Hafid said the ministry is opening the possibility to lower frequency fees for telecom operators to improve the health of the telecom business, which requires large capital. The timing of any fee reduction has not been determined as coordination with other ministries and agencies is needed.\n5. BPI CIO Pandu Sjahrir announced that a Qatar joint investment fund of USD 4 billion will focus on priority sectors such as food security, energy security, downstream processing, digital infrastructure, health, and tourism.\n6. FORE CEO Vico Lomar said the company targets a net profit growth of about +70-80% in 2025. For the first nine months of 2024, FORE posted a net profit of IDR 42 billion (a turnaround from a loss in 9M23), revenue of IDR 727 billion (+135% YoY) and same-store sales growth of +42% YoY. FORE also aims to open 55 new stores in 2025, targeting a total of 300 stores by year-end, and 600 stores within five years.\n7. AVIA Deputy CEO Ruslan Tanoko bought approximately 8 million AVIA shares at an average price of IDR 390 per share between 8-10 April 2025, a transaction worth about IDR 3.1 billion. After the transaction, his ownership increased from 0.0609% to 0.0738%.\n8. Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada (CMNP) plans a rights issue of roughly 2.2 billion new shares, which could dilute existing shareholders by up to 25%. The issue price has not been announced; proceeds will be used for capital contributions or loans to subsidiaries for toll road construction. The plan will be discussed at the extraordinary shareholders meeting on 22 May 2025.\n9. Indosat (ISAT) intends to expand its business activities to include, but not limited to, defense-related telecommunications, telecom resale services, AI-based programming, IoT consulting and design, payment system support, advertising, and market research services. The plan will be discussed at the shareholders meeting on 28 May 2025.",
