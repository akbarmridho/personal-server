      "title": "New Finance Minister Promises to Maintain State Budget Deficit, Ease Liquidity",
      "content": "Finance Minister, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, confirmed that his ministry will maintain the State Budget (APBN) deficit below 3% of GDP and asserted there is no need to impose new taxes - in line with the stance of his predecessor, Sri Mulyani. Purbaya also stated that his ministry plans to inject existing government cash reserves held at Bank Indonesia, approximately 200 trillion rupiah, into the banking system to improve liquidity and encourage credit disbursement, thereby fostering job creation. In a meeting with the DPR on Wednesday (10/9), Purbaya mentioned that tight liquidity had caused an economic slowdown in Indonesia over the past year. He also highlighted slow government spending, resulting in government cash reserves at Bank Indonesia increasing to 430 trillion rupiah. Purbaya stated that the liquidity injection plan has been discussed with Bank Indonesia senior deputies so that these funds are not reabsorbed by the central bank, but rather can be utilized by the banking sector. Purbaya's statement comes amidst foreign investor concerns regarding the uncertainty of fiscal discipline following President Prabowo Subianto replacing Sri Mulyani as finance minister. Sri Mulyani herself was regarded as a symbol of fiscal credibility during the tenure of the last 3 Indonesian presidents, according to Bloomberg. Purbaya said that he will not take unconventional steps. Purbaya also explained that he will focus on accelerating government programs and improving liquidity to boost economic growth without increasing the government's debt burden. Previously, Purbaya claimed that the Indonesian economy could grow above +6% YoY in the near future, potentially even reaching the +8% YoY growth target set by President Prabowo. For comparison, the 2025 APBN outlook forecasts economic growth in the range of +4.7-5% YoY, while the 2026 RAPBN targets economic growth of +5.4% YoY.",

The increase in the IHSG today was led by the Financial sector (+1.33%) driven by the rise in stock prices of big banks, possibly also influenced by positive sentiment from the government's plan to ease liquidity which is one of the main issues for the banking sector currently. As an illustration, here is the Loan-to-Deposit (LDR) Ratio position for banks only from the big 4 banks as of June 2025 (except BMRI as of May 2025), sorted from highest to lowest: BMRI (93.1%), BBNI (86.2%), BBRI (85%), and BBCA (78%).",

Responding to Israel's move, the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned the attack, stating that it was a violation of international law.

This estimate is driven by a large build-up of oil inventories following increased production by OPEC+ members. EIA forecasts that the global oil inventory build-up will average more than 2 million barrels per day in the 3Q25-1Q26 period. EIA explained that this projection was made before OPEC+ announced a production increase plan of 137 thousand barrels per day in October 2025. 3. US President, Donald Trump, told European Union officials that he is willing to impose new tariffs on India and China to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the war with Ukraine.
