      "title": "Danantara Prepares Rp210 Trillion Credit Ceiling for Merah Putih Village Cooperatives",
      "content": "The Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Farida Farichah, stated that Danantara has agreed to provide a credit ceiling of 210 trillion rupiah for the development of approximately 80,000 units of Merah Putih Village Cooperatives (KDMP). Farida explained that Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), Bank Mandiri (BMRI), and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) will each manage 66 trillion rupiah, while the remaining 12 trillion rupiah will be placed in Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS). See the table above to see the comparison of these ceilings against the current loan and third-party fund positions of the state-owned bank group (Himbara).\nDanantara itself has not commented on Farida's statement, so the source of funds for the ceiling is not clearly known. Previously, the Minister of Cooperatives, Ferry Juliantono, in early October 2025 conveyed that Danantara and the Ministry of Finance would channel additional funds to KDMP in order to accelerate physical development as well as operational needs for outlets and warehousing. The CEO of Danantara, Rosan Roeslani, explained that the support from the Ministry of Finance will be channeled through the State Budget (APBN), while the Director General at the Ministry of Finance, Askolani, mentioned that the allocation can be taken from regional transfer budgets or other spending posts. In the Draft State Budget and Financial Notes for 2026, it is mentioned that the KDMP program will be given support of 83 trillion rupiah from the APBN to be channeled through Himbara.\nTo date, financing for KDMP that has been executed also involves Himbara, including: 1) placement of the remaining 2025 APBN surplus budget (SAL) amounting to 16 trillion rupiah, with related regulations having been promulgated in early September 2025; and 2) liquidity injection amounting to 200 trillion rupiah in early September 2025, which includes an incentive for interest cost reduction from ~3.8% to 2% if these funds are used for the disbursement of KDMP credit.\nThese latest KDMP developments follow reports of a delay in the program's implementation timeline. Most recently, the government targeted the completion and operation of physical infrastructure development for approximately 80,000 KDMP by March 2026, delayed from the initial target this month. As of Tuesday (28/10), only 22,351 KDMP have been declared active, equivalent to 28% of the government's target. Meanwhile, 82,246 KDMP have legal status, with 16,485 cooperatives already having outlets.\n\nKey Takeaway\nWe assess that the discourse on KDMP funding from Danantara has the potential to become a positive sentiment for Himbara because it will provide assurance that the execution risk and profitability of the KDMP program will not burden bank capital. However, there are no details yet regarding the scheme for placing the 210 trillion rupiah fund into Himbara, including the placement interest rate (if any). From the debtor's side, the KDMP credit interest rate has been set at 6% with a maximum financing of 3 billion rupiah per cooperative and a maximum tenor of 72 months.",

The quarterly net profit increase in 3Q25 was mainly driven by the absence of a one-off loss on the impairment of business development projects (vs. 2Q25: loss of 6.5 million US dollars).
