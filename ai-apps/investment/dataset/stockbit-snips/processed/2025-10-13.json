      "title": "Trump Says Trade with China Will Be Fine After Threatening Additional Tariff",
      "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday (12 October) that trade relations between the United States and China “will be fine.” This statement reverses his comment on Friday (10 October), when he threatened to impose an additional tariff of 100 percentage points on goods originating from China and to control all exports of important U.S. software to China starting 1 November 2025. Trump explained that the threat was based on China’s decision to tighten export restrictions on rare-earth minerals effective 1 December 2025, which also includes equipment used for mining and refining those minerals. China produces 90 % of the world’s processed rare-earths and rare-earth magnets, which are used in electric vehicles and military radars. Reuters reported that the upcoming Chinese export restrictions will require exporters to obtain a licence before exporting products containing more than 0.1 % Chinese-origin rare earths or those produced with Chinese technology. Licences will be granted to qualifying parties, though the exact criteria have not been disclosed. China will also reject export licence applications for rare-earth minerals related to the defence sector and will scrutinise applications linked to advanced semiconductors and certain artificial-intelligence applications. In response, the Chinese government urged both sides to resume negotiations, while stating it is ready to take retaliatory measures if the United States does not withdraw its policy. Currently, the U.S. tariff on Chinese products stands at 30 % and China’s tariff on U.S. goods is 10 %. The U.S. equity markets corrected sharply on Friday (10 October) with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling 2.7 % and 3.6 % respectively, but S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures rose about 1 % on Monday (13 October) after Trump’s softened comments over the weekend. The key takeaway is that, based on previous tariff escalations, the announced tariff threat may be a negotiating tactic as the temporary tariff-delay deadline is set to expire in mid-November 2025. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet at the APEC Summit in South Korea on 31 October–1 November 2025. Although Trump said on Friday he did not see a need to meet Xi, he later clarified that the meeting has not been cancelled.",
