The Politburo also mentioned that the Chinese government will stabilize the stock and property markets, and must strongly boost consumption and expand domestic demand \"in all directions.\" Morgan Stanley's team of economists stated that the Politburo's statement provides the most aggressive stimulus tone in the last decade, although implementation remains uncertain.",

      "content": "Reuters reported that Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. (OCBC Singapore) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB Malaysia) are competing to acquire a controlling stake in Bank Pan Indonesia (PNBN). Reuters sources mentioned that OCBC Singapore and CIMB Malaysia have submitted non-binding offers for the shares being offered by ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. and the Gunawan family. The offers are reportedly due this month. In addition to OCBC Singapore and CIMB Malaysia, Reuters sources mentioned that Maybank Group Malaysia, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (SMBC) are also interested in buying PNBN. PNBN has not commented on this issue, while OCBC Singapore, CIMB Malaysia, Maybank Malaysia, MUFG, and SMBC declined to comment. Previously, Bloomberg and Reuters reported that the Gunawan family and ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. were considering selling their stake in PNBN. Together they own a total of 85.74% of PNBN shares, with the controlling Gunawan family holding 46.52% and ANZ holding 39.22%. Their combined shares were valued at approximately 39 trillion Rupiah based on Tuesday's (10/12) closing price. Key Takeaway: If this acquisition materializes, both OCBC Singapore and CIMB Malaysia as potential buyers could potentially consolidate PNBN into their respective existing business units - Bank CIMB Niaga (BNGA) if purchased by CIMB Malaysia, or Bank OCBC NISP (NISP) if purchased by OCBC Singapore. This is because Indonesian banking regulations require a single presence policy, where each controlling shareholder can only own one bank or several banks through a consolidation scheme. The bank consolidation scheme can take the form of a merger, amalgamation, integration, or the establishment of a Joint Business Group (KUB). On this day, the PNBN stock price closed up +5.8% at 2,010 Rupiah per share.",
