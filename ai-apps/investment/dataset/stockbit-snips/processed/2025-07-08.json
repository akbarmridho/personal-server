      "title": "US Does Not Change Tariff for Indonesia at 32%",
      "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday (July 7 local time) set a tariff of 32% on products originating from Indonesia, unchanged from the initial tariff announced in April 2025. Ministry of Coordinating Economic Affairs spokesperson Haryo Limanseto said Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto is scheduled to arrive in the United States on Tuesday (July 8) to meet with U.S. officials to discuss Trump’s tariff decision for Indonesia. The United States will implement the new tariff on August 1, 2025, delayed from the previously set deadline of July 9, 2025. Trump also said the August 1, 2025 deadline is “not 100% certain,” indicating the U.S. government remains open to further negotiations. The tariff for Indonesia remains unchanged even though the Indonesian government has offered a package worth 34 billion US dollars for investment and import of goods from the United States, including the purchase of 1 million tons of U.S. wheat per year for the 2026-2030 period and energy purchases worth 15.5 billion US dollars. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Deputy Minister Yuliot Tanjung said the decision to import energy from the United States will be postponed until final negotiations are concluded. Previously, Airlangga hoped Indonesia could reach a lower tariff agreement than Vietnam, given the size of Indonesia’s offered package. Last week, the United States reduced the tariff on Vietnamese imports from 46% to 20%, while goods from other countries shipped through Vietnam are subject to a 40% tariff. In his letter to President Prabowo Subianto, Trump stated that a 32% tariff on Indonesia is still insufficient to eliminate the trade deficit, which he claimed is caused by tariffs, non-tariff measures, and trade barriers imposed by Indonesia. Trump also warned that if Indonesia imposes retaliatory tariffs on the United States, the United States will add a similar tariff on top of the existing 32%. In response, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 0.05% on Tuesday (July 8), the Indonesian rupiah strengthened by 0.14% to 16,208 per US dollar, and the 10-year government bond yield rose by 0.9 basis points to 6.589%. Overall, Asian market reaction was muted today, including Indonesia. Apart from the rupiah, most Asian emerging-market currencies appreciated against the US dollar, such as the South Korean won (+0.57%) and the Thai baht (+0.14%). This may indicate that market participants remain optimistic that the decision is not final and an agreement can be reached before August 1, 2025. For Indonesia, we assess that the risk of failing to reach a trade agreement (relative to competing countries) could pressure Indonesian exports, making economic growth increasingly dependent on domestic factors, especially government spending, in the current economic context.",

      "content": "1. Reuters reported that the United States government will not immediately impose an additional 10% tariff on BRICS member countries. Reuters sources said the additional tariff would only be applied if BRICS members adopt policies deemed “anti-American.” The Reuters report followed President Donald Trump’s threat on Sunday (July 6) to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country allied with “anti-American BRICS” policies, without further detail. The BRICS countries themselves agreed last weekend to continue discussions on a cross-border payment system for trade and investment. 2. China on Tuesday (July 8) warned the United States not to reignite trade tensions and threatened retaliation against countries that make agreements with the United States to exclude China from the global supply chain. 3. The Secretary General of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (GAPKI), Hadi Sugeng, said that Indonesia’s palm oil exports to the United States could fall by about 15-20% because of the 32% U.S. tariff on Indonesian imports. He explained that the average Indonesian palm oil export to the U.S. reached 2.25 million metric tons per year over the past three years. In 2024, Indonesia exported 29.5 million tons of palm oil to the global market. Indonesian palm oil, which accounts for 85% of U.S. palm oil imports, could lose market share to Malaysian palm oil, which faces a lower tariff of 25%. Additionally, Hadi noted that the competitiveness of Indonesian palm oil will also decline against other vegetable oils such as soybean oil and rapeseed oil, especially if those exporting countries receive lower tariffs. 4. The government together with Commission XI of the House of Representatives agreed on a proposal to expand state revenue base in 2026 by imposing export duties on coal and gold products. Deputy Chair of Commission XI, Fauzi H Amro, said the export duty rates will be proposed by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources to the Ministry of Finance. Currently, raw gold or dore bullion is already subject to export duties according to Minister of Finance Regulation No. 38/2024, but gold bars and jewelry are not included. Coal has not been subject to export duties since 2006 and is only levied a royalty as part of non-tax state revenue (PNBP). 5. Bank Indonesia recorded that Indonesia’s consumer confidence index rose to 117.8 in June 2025 (versus 117.5 in May 2025). Although it increased, the June 2025 index remains close to the May 2025 level, which is the lowest since September 2022 amid weakening purchasing power and a shrinking middle class.",
