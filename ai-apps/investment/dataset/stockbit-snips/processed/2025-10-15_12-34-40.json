      "title": "Purbaya Revises Upward Q4'25 Economic Growth Projection & Opens Opportunity to Lower VAT",
      "content": "Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, said on Tuesday (10/14) that economic growth could reach +5.67% YoY in Q4'25, higher than the previous projection delivered by Purbaya last week at the level of +5.5%. According to Purbaya, the acceleration of economic growth in Q4'25 - which will be driven by new stimulus to be announced soon by the government - can boost inflows, thus the rupiah exchange rate is likely to strengthen. At the end of September 2025, the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, told the Financial Times that the government is planning a stimulus worth 2 billion US dollars (equivalent to ~33 trillion rupiah) to boost consumer spending during the Christmas and New Year holiday period. The last stimulus provided by the government was a stimulus worth 16.2 trillion rupiah announced in mid-September 2025. For 2026 itself, the government will launch several fiscal incentive schemes as follows: Extension of 100% DTP VAT for property until 2027 to maintain middle-class purchasing power and support the property sector which has a large multiplier effect. Under this scheme, the government will fully bear the VAT on the purchase of ready-to-occupy new homes with a maximum selling price of 2 billion rupiah. As for property with prices around 2-5 billion rupiah, the VAT exemption only applies to the first 2 billion rupiah. Not increasing excise duty and the Retail Selling Price (HJE) of cigarettes to maintain price stability and industry burden amidst economic recovery. Additionally, Purbaya also said that the government is opening the opportunity to lower the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate in 2026. Currently, the effective VAT for general goods and services is at the 11% level. Purbaya added that this discourse is not yet final, but a reduction in the VAT rate is possible if the economy and state revenue are in good condition. Previously, Purbaya projected that the Indonesian economy would accelerate further next year where growth could reach +6% YoY in 2H26.",
