      "title": "Sri Mulyani Replaced by Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa as Finance Minister",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto today, Monday (8/9), replaced Sri Mulyani from the position of Finance Minister, a post she had held for almost 14 years in the last 20 years. As her replacement, President Prabowo inaugurated Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, who has served since 2020 as Chairman of the Board of Commissioners at the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS). Following this decision, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed down 1.28% to 7,767, and the one-month NDF rupiah rate against the US dollar weakened 1.07% to 16,585 by late afternoon. Prior to today’s reshuffle, Sri Mulyani was often rumored to resign from her post. Rumors of her resignation resurfaced at the end of August 2025 after her house was looted during a large demonstration. State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi, in today’s press conference, only explained that the removal of Sri Mulyani from her position is a presidential prerogative. According to Bloomberg, Sri Mulyani has been a symbol of fiscal credibility for the last three Indonesian presidents and is widely recognized for helping Indonesia secure investment-grade credit ratings. Purbaya previously served in government as Deputy Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment and as a special staff member of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs. Before entering government, Purbaya was a senior economist at Danareksa Research Institute and the chief executive officer of PT Danareksa Sekuritas.",

      "content": "1. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm payrolls (NFP) in August 2025 increased by only 22,000, well below the consensus expectation of 75,000. July 2025 NFP data were revised up from 73,000 to 79,000. June 2025 NFP was revised from an increase of 14,000 to a decrease of 13,000, marking the first decline since December 2020. The unemployment rate rose from 4.2% in July 2025 to 4.3% in August 2025, the highest level since October 2021. In response, the market is currently expecting a Federal Reserve rate cut in September 2025 with a probability of 100%, based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool.\n2. The Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia said on Monday (8/9) that burden-sharing will be carried out prudently. Under the scheme, Bank Indonesia will pay a higher interest rate on government deposits to help finance housing and cooperative programs launched by President Prabowo’s administration. The ministries did not disclose the interest rate level, the amount to be paid, or the program duration. The measure was taken amid growing concerns about the impact of these programs on the budget.\n3. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said that the free trade agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA) will be signed on 23 September 2025. Earlier, in June 2025, Airlangga said the agreement would give Indonesia zero tariffs for about 80% of its export products to the EU and remove non-tariff barriers, aiming for greater market access for footwear, garments, palm oil and fishery products. According to several media reports, Indonesian commodities subject to EU tariffs include palm oil derivatives with rates around 5-12.8%, biodiesel (palm-oil based) around 8-18%, textiles around 8-12%, and seafood around 16-20%.\n4. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said on Monday (8/9) that the government targets online shopping festival (Harbolnas) 2025 transaction volume to reach 35 trillion rupiah, a 12.2% year-on-year increase compared with 31.2 trillion rupiah in 2024. Harbolnas 2025 will be held from 10-16 December 2025.\n5. Bank Indonesia recorded that Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves at the end of August 2025 fell to 150.7 billion US dollars (down from 152 billion in July 2025). The decline was driven by external debt repayments and exchange rate stabilization measures. The reserve level at the end of August 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.3 months of imports or 6.1 months of imports plus external debt payments.",
