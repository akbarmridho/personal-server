      "title": "S&P500 Records All-Time High Following US GDP Revision",
      "content": "The S&P 500 recorded an all-time high at the close on Thursday (28 August) local time, rising +0.32% to 6,502, following the upward revision of U.S. 2Q25 GDP data on the same day. U.S. 2Q25 GDP was revised up by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis to an annualized +3.3% (vs. 1Q25: -0.5% annualized), higher than the consensus expectation of +3.1% and the initial estimate of +3%. On a weekly basis, the S&P 500 gained +2.07%, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was relatively flat (-0.82%), while the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 12 basis points to 4.2% on Thursday (28 August). This movement followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks on Friday (22 August) indicating that the central bank may open the possibility of cutting U.S. interest rates at the September 2025 meeting as labor market risk increases. Following the GDP revision, the probability of a September 2025 rate cut remained stable on a weekly basis at about 85% on Friday (29 August), according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Amid the S&P 500 rise, Indonesia’s composite index (IHSG) fell -1.53% to 7,830 on Friday (29 August), driven by negative sentiment from a series of demonstrations since the start of the week.\n\nKey Takeaway: In the near term, the market awaits the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index to be released on Friday (29 August) local time, the U.S. employment data on Friday (5 September), and the U.S. inflation data on 11 September 2025. These three data points could influence the Fed’s rate decision at the September 16-17, 2025 meeting. Jeff Roach of LPL Financial said that weaker U.S. employment data could dampen the momentum of economic growth from the previous quarter, thereby opening further room for rate cuts.",
