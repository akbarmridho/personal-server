      "title": "BEI Implements Revised FCA, Prepares to Release Short Sell",
      "content": "BEI officially implemented the revision of the special monitoring board criteria for full call auction starting Friday (21/6). As previously discussed in Stockbit Snips, this criteria revision will tighten the provisions for a stock to be included in the FCA and provide flexibility for a stock to exit the FCA. In line with the implementation of this revision, 6 stocks have exited the special monitoring board as of Friday (21/6), one of which is Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN). Under the old provisions, BREN - which was subject to criterion number 10 in the special monitoring board - could only trade regularly after 30 calendar days since entering the special monitoring board on May 29, 2024. However, because the new criterion number 10 only requires a duration of 7 trading days for a stock to exit the special monitoring board, BREN's stock can now trade regularly and is no longer under full call auction. This revision was generally responded to positively by market participants, with stocks released from the special monitoring board unanimously strengthening in today's trading, except for those currently suspended. Besides the revision of the special monitoring board criteria, BEI is preparing to release the short sell trading mechanism, with an implementation target no later than October 2024. As of June 14, 2024, BEI has set 116 stocks that can be transacted with short sell, the full list of which can be viewed here. Short selling itself is a trading mechanism in the stock market where investors borrow shares from a broker and sell them in the market with the expectation that the stock price will fall. After the stock price drops, the investor buys back the shares at a lower price and returns them to the broker, thereby profiting from the difference between the selling price and the repurchase price. Key Takeaway: Generally, the revision of the full call auction special monitoring board criteria and the implementation of short sell potentially increase stock transaction liquidity. How broad investor access to the short sell feature will be depends on the final mechanism and terms and conditions provided by the exchange to its members. The mechanism and terms and conditions from the exchange will determine the extent of interest from exchange members in executing short sells.",
