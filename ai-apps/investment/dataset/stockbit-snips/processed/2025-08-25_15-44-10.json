      "title": "Powell Signals Opportunity to Cut Interest Rates",
      "content": "The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, in his speech on Friday (22/8) local time, signaled that the central bank is opening the possibility of cutting US interest rates at the September 2025 meeting, marking a shift in tone from the central bank's hawkish stance amid uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs. However, Powell asserted that they do not yet have a definite decision.\nPowell stated that based on the Fed's baseline outlook, risks to the labor market are increasing, while the impact of tariffs on inflation is expected to be only temporary. Before Powell delivered his speech, the market had anticipated a Fed rate cut in September 2025 following weak US labor data for the period of May-July 2025.\nPowell also announced that the Fed will re-adopt Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) as its future monetary policy framework. The Chief Economist at RSM US LLP, Joe Brusuelas, told Reuters that this framework change indicates the Fed's stance will lean more towards higher-for-longer, even though the probability of cutting interest rates in the short term has increased.\nResponding to Powell's speech, the probability of a US rate cut at the September 2025 meeting increased from ~83% a week ago to ~85% as of today, Monday (25/8), based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, the probability of a US rate cut of more than =50 bps until the end of the year increased from ~81% to ~83%.\nThe Fed meeting itself will take place on September 16-17, 2025. Before that meeting, monthly US labor data will be released on September 5, 2025, followed by the release of monthly inflation data the following week, which could influence the Fed's decision.",

      "content": "A rate cut has the potential to increase the attractiveness of risk assets, including emerging market assets like Indonesia. Responding to Powell's relatively dovish speech, the US stock market reacted positively with the S&P500 and Nasdaq strengthening by +1.52% and +1.54% respectively on Friday (22/8) local time. Meanwhile, the IHSG rose +0.87% in today's trading, with sectors sensitive to interest rates such as Finance (+1.87%) and Property (+3.65%) strengthening quite significantly. A Fed rate cut itself can provide further room for Bank Indonesia to lower the BI Rate. Bank Indonesia itself estimates that the Fed will still cut interest rates by -50 bps until the end of the year.",

      "content": "1. A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel on Friday (22/8) supported Indonesia on several key claims in the dispute regarding countervailing duties imposed by the European Union on biodiesel imports from Indonesia. The European Union is Indonesia's third-largest export destination for palm oil products and an important market for biodiesel. Responding to this ruling, the Minister of Trade, Budi Santoso, urged the European Union to immediately revoke the countervailing duties. Reuters reported that the European Union may file an appeal, but a final ruling cannot be made because the WTO's highest appellate court has not been operational since 2019 due to President Donald Trump's first administration repeatedly blocking judge appointments. Previously, the European Union imposed countervailing duties of around 8-18% since 2019 on biodiesel originating from Indonesia, driven by accusations that Indonesian biodiesel producers benefited from subsidies, tax incentives, and access to raw materials below market prices. Meanwhile, Indonesia brought the dispute to the WTO in 2023, alleging that the EU's imposition of duties violated WTO rules.\n2. The Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) announced that it will begin distributing summary trading information at the end of session 1 trading starting Monday (25/8), in addition to the distribution of similar information at the end of the trading day. The files distributed at the end of session 1 include a summary of transaction activities based on investor domicile codes, data on indices listed on the IDX, and a recapitulation of trading based on investor type. All these files are stated to be distributed using the same format as the distribution at the end of the trading day. The IDX explained that the availability of this information is expected to help market participants obtain a more comprehensive overview of investor participation dynamics, while supporting decision-making processes in transactions on the IDX.\n3. Commodity analysis firm Kpler estimates that China's seaborne thermal coal imports grew +12.6% MoM to 25.63 million tonnes in August 2025, marking the highest monthly volume since December 2024. Reuters reported that this increase in imports was driven by thermal power generation, a decline in domestic coal production in China, and low coal prices. Meanwhile, Kpler estimates India's thermal coal imports fell -18.8% MoM to 9.74 million tonnes in August 2025, marking the lowest monthly volume since February 2023. Reuters reported that the decline in Indian coal imports was pressured by a shrinking share of thermal power generation amid an increase in new renewable energy sources and an increase in domestic coal production in India.\n4. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued new regulations regarding mineral reference prices (HPM) and coal reference prices (HPB) through the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 268.K/MB.01/MEM.B/2025, which provides flexibility for mining businesses to sell commodities below the reference price while still requiring tax and royalty payments based on the HPM and HPB. The Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, Gita Mahyarani, told Kontan that this rule does not bring significant changes for businesses and is merely a confirmation of the mechanism already in effect.\n5. President Prabowo Subianto on Monday (25/8) inaugurated Brian Yuliarto as the Head of the Mineral Industry Agency, a new institution that will oversee the development of rare earths and radioactive materials. Brian currently also serves as the Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology.",
