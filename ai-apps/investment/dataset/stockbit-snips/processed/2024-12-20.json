Instead of paying VAT upfront, he suggested that VAT be paid later, after oil and gas are discovered.",

      "title": "TPMA forms joint venture with KKGI, potential additional net profit ~7.6%",
      "content": "Trans Power Marine (TPMA) together with Resources Alam Indonesia (KKGI) announced the establishment of a joint venture (JV) named PT Trans Bahtera Pioneer (TBP). The JV will operate in coal transportation and logistics services in East Kalimantan, a region that produced 210 million tons of coal in 2023, equivalent to about 30% of national production. One of TBP's future clients will be PT Insani Bara Perkasa, a KKGI subsidiary that produced 5.3 million tons in 2023. Ownership of the JV is 50% KKGI and 50% TPMA with an initial capital of 51.5 billion rupiah, so each issuer will contribute 25.75 billion rupiah. The JV's contribution will be reported in both issuers' financial statements using the equity method. In its development plan, TBP will invest 200 billion rupiah to purchase six tugboat and barge sets (used or new) in the first year (2025). The cooperation is expected to expand to 20 sets in the coming years. Financing will consist of at least 20% internal cash and the remainder through bank loans. Previously, TPMA expanded through several JVs. In 2021, TPMA formed PT Trans Logistik Perkasa (TLP) together with T&J Industrial Holding Limited (TJI) – an entity of Tsingshan Holding Group – and Pacific Pelayaran Indonesia. In early September 2024, TPMA also founded Trans Ocean Permata (TOP), a joint venture with PT Samudra Investama Maju. Key Takeaway: Based on a conservative estimate and management input, TBP could add net profit of 2.5 million US dollars when the fleet reaches 20 sets, representing 7.6% of the FY25 TPMA net profit estimate of 32.4 million US dollars (before TBP contribution). With six ships in the first year, TBP could generate net profit of 461 thousand US dollars, equal to 1.4% of the FY25 TPMA net profit estimate. Assumptions used: addition of six ships phased, with two ships in 1Q25 and four ships in 2Q-4Q25; TBP revenue is expected to be lower than TOP in 2025 due to faster delivery expectations for TOP; revenue per set assumed at 1.1 billion rupiah per month (approximately 683 thousand US dollars) for tug and barge, similar to TLP which has the lowest per-set revenue among TPM and BEST; net profit margin assumed at 30%, same as TOP.",
