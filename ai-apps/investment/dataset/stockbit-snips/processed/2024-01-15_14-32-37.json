      "title": "Indonesia's Upstream Oil and Gas Investment +13% YoY in FY23, Lifting Below Target",
      "content": "SKK Migas has released a report on the realization of investment and performance of the upstream oil and gas sector in Indonesia during 2023. Here are the details: Investment grew +13% YoY to US$ 13.7 billion, exceeding global upstream oil and gas investment growth in the range of +6.5% YoY and marking the largest upstream oil and gas investment in Indonesia in the last 8 years. Oil lifting decreased by -1.1% YoY to 605.5 MBOPD, equivalent to 92.5% of the 2023 State Budget target and 98% of the 2023 SKK Migas target. Gas sales rose +0.6% YoY to 5,378 MMSCFD, equivalent to 87% of the 2023 State Budget target and 96.5% of the 2023 SKK Migas target. During 2023, Indonesia also successfully discovered 2 giant gas block discoveries, namely Geng North and Layaran. Both blocks are among the 5 largest natural gas block discoveries in the world in 2023, and also become Indonesia's largest discoveries since 2000. The Head of SKK Migas, Dwi Soetjipto, stated that the increase in investment in 2023 - especially for development well drilling - has been able to reduce the rate of decline in oil production and resume increasing Indonesia's gas production. For 2024, the following targets are set: Oil lifting of 596 MBOPD based on the 2024 SKK Migas target and 635 MBOPD based on the 2024 State Budget. Gas sales of 5,544 MMSCFD based on the 2024 SKK Migas target and 5,785 MMSCFD based on the 2024 State Budget. Investment in upstream oil and gas increased by +29.2% YoY to US$ 17.7 billion. Key Takeaway: The increasing trend of upstream oil and gas investment in Indonesia has the potential to bring positive impacts for issuers in oil and gas supporting services through increased job volume and better service rates, which can ultimately grow revenue and net profit. On the IDX, several issuers operating in oil and gas supporting services are ELSA, APEX, WINS, LEAD, RUIS, BBRM, and HITS. Stockbit has also released Mini Unboxing WINS and Mini Unboxing ELSA which discuss the prospects and challenges of these two stocks.",
