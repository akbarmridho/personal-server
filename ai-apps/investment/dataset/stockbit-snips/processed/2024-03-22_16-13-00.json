      "title": "Government Plans to Merge 7 State-Owned Construction Companies into 3 Entities",
      "content": "State-Owned Enterprises Minister, Erick Thohir, stated that the government plans to reduce the number of State-Owned Construction Companies (BUMN Karya) from 7 companies to 3 companies through consolidation. This action is part of the financial recovery efforts for BUMN Karya, which was previously discussed since 2023. Erick mentioned that the entities that will remain after the merger are Adhi Karya ($ADHI), PT PP ($PTPP), and PT Hutama Karya. Subsequently, each resulting entity will be given a focus according to its specific business lines and expertise, with the following details: PT Hutama Karya and Waskita Karya ($WSKT): toll road projects, non-toll roads, institutional building, and residential commercial. PTPP and Wijaya Karya ($WIKA): airport projects, port projects, as well as some remaining residential projects. ADHI, PT Nindya Karya, and PT Brantas Abipraya: construction projects related to water and railway infrastructure. Erick stated that coordination has been conducted with the Ministry of Public Works and Housing and the Ministry of Finance to push this consolidation plan. Erick did not provide a date for when the BUMN Karya consolidation action will be completed, only emphasizing that they still have time to realize this corporate action until October 2024 or before his term ends. Regarding this news, $WIKA and $ADHI declined to comment, while $PTPP stated they are still awaiting clearer direction from the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises. The financial health condition of BUMN Karya has been under scrutiny in recent years, with $WIKA and $WSKT facing a series of PKPU (Postponement of Debt Payment Obligations). Based on the Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER) metric, all BUMN Karya issuers have high debt levels: WSKT: 9.88x (as of 9M23), WIKA: 4.52x (as of 9M23), PTPP: 1.55x (as of FY23), ADHI: 1.37x (as of FY23). In February 2024, WIKA together with 15 creditors agreed on a master restructuring agreement (MRA) valued at 24.79 trillion rupiah. Key Takeaway: Although details of the merger plan are not yet available, we assess that the consolidation of BUMN Karya can have a positive long-term impact. Besides the capital structure of the merged entities becoming stronger, the division of business focus will also reduce competition and increase specialization. Thus, the profitability of BUMN Karya can increase in the future. Specifically for the PTPP and WIKA merger discourse, we assess that merging both has the potential to provide a negative sentiment for PTPP in the short term. This is because PTPP currently has much better financial health and profitability compared to WIKA. However, the actual impact of the merger between the two companies will depend on the merger scheme. On Friday (22/3), the price of PTPP shares dropped by -2.78%, ADHI was unchanged, while WIKA and WSKT were still under suspension. Related Stocks: $ADHI, $WIKA, $WSKT, $PTPP.",
