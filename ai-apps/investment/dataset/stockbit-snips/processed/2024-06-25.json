      "title": "Government Plans to Extend Credit Restructuring Relaxation",
      "content": "Minister of Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said that President Joko Widodo requested the relaxation of credit restructuring for Covid-19‑affected loans be extended until 2025. The proposal aims to reduce the burden on the banking industry in provisioning for losses from non‑performing People's Business Credit (KUR).\n\nAirlangga said the proposal will be followed up through the Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) and the Governor of Bank Indonesia. In response, the Chairman of the OJK Board of Commissioners Mahendra Siregar said that the regulator will take deeper steps and evaluate the credit restructuring program that has been running.\n\nThe Covid‑19‑affected credit restructuring relaxation originally started in March 2020 and was supposed to end in March 2024. Although its term has ended, OJK still gives banks time to continue the restructuring that is already underway.\n\nWith the end of the relaxation, loans that have been restructured but remain problematic will no longer be classified as performing, but will move to the problematic category. As a result, banks must charge a provisioning cost to create reserves for those problematic loans.\n\nBelow is a summary of the development of Covid‑19‑affected credit restructuring:\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess that if the proposal is implemented, it could have a positive impact on banks' net profit in the short term due to reduced provisioning burden from the re‑classification of problematic loans. On the other hand, if the restructured loans do not improve, the policy in the long term will only postpone the classification of bad loans.",

      "content": "Deputy III of the Presidential Staff Edy Priyono said the government predicts Indonesia will face a rice deficit in July 2024 as national rice production fell 20.9% year‑on‑year to 10.27 million tons in the first four months of 2024.\n\nTrade Minister Zulkifli Hasan said the retail price ceiling (HET) for cooking oil will rise next week from 14,000 rupiah per liter to 15,700 rupiah per liter, higher than the initially planned increase to 15,500 rupiah per liter.\n\nBank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo said in a meeting with the DPR on Monday (24/6) that the central bank does not see an urgent need to raise the policy interest rate to stabilize the rupiah. This assessment is based on relatively low inflation, and further rate hikes would negatively affect economic growth. Perry also expressed optimism that the rupiah will strengthen to a fundamental level below 16,000 per US dollar.\n\nFinance Minister Sri Mulyani said the 2024 state budget recorded a deficit of 21.8 trillion rupiah or 0.1% of GDP as of May 2024. The deficit was driven by state revenue which fell 7.1% year‑on‑year to 1,123.5 trillion rupiah, equal to 40.1% of the 2024 budget target, due to declines across all revenue items. Meanwhile, actual government spending rose 14% year‑on‑year to 1,145.3 trillion rupiah, equal to 34.4% of the 2024 budget target.\n\nThe World Bank suggested the Indonesian government lower the taxable income threshold for companies to boost state revenue. World Bank Chief Economist Habib Rab said the current corporate tax threshold in Indonesia is six times higher than in OECD countries. Director at the Directorate General of Taxes Dwi Astuti said the agency is discussing the proposal internally.\n\nEramet and BASF SE announced they will cancel a joint‑venture nickel smelter investment worth 2.6 billion US dollars in Weda Bay. BASF told Bloomberg that they no longer see a need for the investment as global electric‑battery supply increases.\n\nNFC Indonesia, through its subsidiary PT Energi Selalu Baru (ESB), announced it has acquired 50% of the shares in Infi Asia E‑Mobility Pte. Ltd. with an undisclosed transaction value. The move aims to accelerate ESB’s expansion into the main Southeast Asian markets, including Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. ESB is a producer of Volta electric scooters. As of 1Q24, ESB has facilitated more than 665,000 battery‑swap transactions through 299 swap stations.",
