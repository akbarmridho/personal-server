      "title": "ADRO Plans Spin-off of Thermal Coal Business",
      "content": "Adaro Energy Indonesia (ADRO) plans to spin off and sell its entire thermal coal business under PT Adaro Andalan Indonesia (AAI). The sale of AAI shares will be carried out through an initial public offering (PUPS) to existing shareholders who are interested. ADRO is also considering a cash dividend to all shareholders, which could be used to help finance shareholders who wish to participate in the AAI PUPS.\n\nThe offering price for the AAI PUPS will use the volume weighted average price (VWAP) formed after market close on the record date, while ensuring transaction fairness as regulated in POJK No. 35 of 2020. According to an assessment by a public appraisal firm, the fair price of AAI is estimated at 2.45‑2.6 billion US dollars.\n\nThe plan will be discussed at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPSLB) on 18 October 2024.\n\nAAI is a subsidiary of ADRO with 99.99% ownership and operates in thermal coal and supporting services for coal mining. Its business lines include logistics services, land services, water, investments, and power generation.\n\nAs of 1H24, AAI has total assets of 5.4 billion US dollars, representing 52.9% of ADRO’s total assets. In the same period, AAI’s revenue and net profit were 2.6 billion US dollars and 992.8 million US dollars, respectively, representing 89.4% of ADRO’s revenue and 104.8% of ADRO’s net profit. The net profit includes a non‑recurring income of 322.9 million US dollars that is excluded from ADRO’s net profit.\n\nKey Takeaway: After this transaction, ADRO will focus on the metallurgical coal segment under Adaro Minerals (ADMR) and the renewable energy segment under Adaro Green. The proceeds from the AAI spin‑off can be used by the company to fund organic or inorganic expansion or to distribute dividends to shareholders.\n\nBased on the fair price of AAI and its 1H24 financials, excluding the non‑recurring profit of 322.9 million US dollars, AAI could be valued at 1.8‑2 times FY24F annualized P/E. This valuation is far below its peers, ITMG and PTBA, which trade at FY24F annualized P/E of 7.04 and 7.71 respectively.\n\nThe transaction could also benefit Saratoga Investama Sedaya (SRTG), which holds about 15% of ADRO, as SRTG may receive a special dividend from the spin‑off and will have the option to participate in the AAI share offering.",

Bloomberg cited that ANZ has engaged financial advisers to divest the stake, with potential buyers including Japanese and Malaysian banks. Previously, ANZ attempted to sell PNBN in 2015, but negotiations stalled because PNBN’s controlling shareholders refused to grant a board seat to the new investor. Bloomberg also noted that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. had previously considered buying PNBN but withdrew over valuation issues.",

Consequently, ASII’s market share fell to 55.3% in August 2024 (July 2024: 59%; August 2023: 57.1%).

Over the first eight months of 2024, ASII’s wholesales dropped 15.8% YoY with a market share of 56.7% (8M23: 55.8%).",
