      "title": "US Core Inflation Below Expectations, Rate Cut Expectations Rise",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday (15 Jan) announced that core inflation in the United States eased year-over-year in December 2024 and came in below expectations, although headline inflation rose. Details:\n- YoY inflation: 2.9% (consensus: 2.9%; Nov 2024: 2.7%)\n- MoM inflation: 0.4% (consensus: 0.3%; Nov 2024: 0.3%)\n- Core YoY inflation: 3.2% (consensus: 3.3%; Nov 2024: 3.3%)\n- Core MoM inflation: 0.2% (consensus: 0.2%; Nov 2024: 0.3%)\nThe above development revives market hopes for more US rate cuts. Before the data release, the market was generally pessimistic with a higher-for-longer narrative, and the Fed was expected to cut rates by only 25 basis points this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool on Thursday (16 Jan), the probability that the Fed will cut rates by more than 25 basis points in 2025 rose to 45%, up from 34.8% on 14 Jan 2025.\nFollowing the inflation data, US equity markets closed higher on Wednesday (15 Jan): DJIA +1.6%, S&P 500 +1.8%, Nasdaq +2.4%. On the same day, the US Dollar Index (DXY) fell 0.16% to 109.1 and the 10-year US Treasury yield dropped 14 basis points to 4.653%.\nIn Indonesia, the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) closed up 0.39% on Thursday (16 Jan), while the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield fell 9 basis points to 7.172% and the rupiah weakened 0.24% against the US dollar to 16,360.\nBank Indonesia’s Head of Monetary Management and Securities Asset Department, Edi Susianto, said the rupiah’s weakness remains under control. He noted the depreciation is short-term as the market digests Bank Indonesia’s decision to cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% on Wednesday (15 Jan).\nKey Takeaway\nAlthough the increased Fed rate-cut expectations are a positive signal for Indonesia, we assess the market will remain volatile until further clarity on the new US administration’s policy, which could affect rate direction. Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated as US President on 20 Jan 2024 local time. The next Fed meeting is set for 28-29 Jan 2024 local time.\nTo cope with volatility from shifting rate narratives, investors can lock in short-term high-yield bonds with low volatility such as PBS003 (2-year maturity) offering a yield of 6.79% per annum.",
