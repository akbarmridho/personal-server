      "title": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) FY24 Net Profit +0.1% YoY, Slightly Below Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded a decrease in net profit in 4Q24 to 15.1 trillion rupiah (-6.3% YoY, -1.8% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 2024 to 60.2 trillion rupiah (+0.1% YoY), slightly below expectations as it equals 98.5% of the consensus estimate. This performance was caused by: 1) Net Interest Margin (NIM) in line with guidance; 2) cost of credit (CoC) worse than guidance; and 3) credit growth below guidance. NIM In Line with Guidance; 2025 NIM Target at 7.3-7.7%. BBRI recorded a decrease in NIM to the level of 7.4% in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: 8.3%, 3Q24: 8%), so the NIM for 2024 fell to 7.74% (vs. 2023: 8.2%) and was in line with management guidance in the range of 7.6-8%. Loan yield for 2024 increased to 13.2% (vs. 2023: 13.1%), while the cost of fund rose to 3.7% (vs. 2023: 3.1%). BBRI management targets NIM in 2025 to slightly decline in the range of 7.3-7.7%, and provides guidance regarding the potential for a one-off adjustment from modification loss which may impact NIM during 1H25. CoC Worse than Guidance; 2025 CoC Target at 3-3.2%. BBRI recorded an improvement in CoC to 2.8% in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: 2.2%, 3Q24: 3.2%), although high CoC at the beginning of the year still caused the CoC throughout 2024 to swell to 3.2% (vs. 2023: 2.4%) and was worse than management guidance targeting CoC below 3%. The fact that CoC was worse than guidance was also caused by lower credit growth than guidance. This is reflected in the +41% YoY increase in provision expenses during 2024, which resulted in flat net profit growth. BBRI management targets CoC in 2025 in the range of 3-3.2%, and provides guidance regarding the potential increase in CoC in 1Q25 along with the plan for front loading provisioning from subsidiaries and modification loss. CoC is expected to start normalizing in 2H25. In terms of asset quality, Loan-at-Risk (LAR) improved to 10.7% in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: 12.5%, 3Q24: 11.7%), while Gross NPL also dropped to 2.8% (vs. 4Q23: 3%, 3Q24: 2.9%) and was in line with management guidance targeting NPL below 3%. BBRI management also provided guidance that Special Mention Loans (SML) are expected to increase until 1H25, with NPLs for the micro and ultra-micro segments remaining high. Credit Growth Below Guidance; 2025 Target at +7-9% YoY. BBRI recorded credit growth of +7% YoY in 2024 (vs. 2023: +11.2% YoY, 3Q24: +8.2% YoY), lower than management guidance in the range of +10-12% YoY. This realization was supported by the corporate (+24% YoY) and consumer (+10% YoY) segments, with a slowdown in the growth of the micro segment (+2.7% YoY) and small segment (-0.7% YoY). Meanwhile, third-party funds (DPK) only grew +0.5% YoY in 2024, in line with the company's strategy to lower time deposits (TD), resulting in the bank entity's Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) reaching 88.9% in 2024 (vs. 4Q23: 84.2%). BBRI management targets credit growth in the range of +7-9% YoY in 2025. 2024 Dividend Payout Ratio (DPR) Minimum 85%. BBRI management plans to propose a DPR for the 2024 fiscal year of a minimum of 85% (vs. 2023: 80%) at the AGM in March 2025, indicating a dividend yield of approximately ~8.3% (including the interim dividend in December 2024) based on the share price as of Wednesday (12/2) at 4,030 rupiah per share. Key Takeaway. We assess BBRI's performance as mixed. Generally, we are cautious about the future outlook, especially due to management guidance suggesting a difficult condition in 1Q25 before it is expected to gradually improve in 2Q25-4Q25. On the other hand, although worse than guidance, we see a positive side in the improving trend of CoC and asset quality, which were the main concerns regarding BBRI's performance in 2024. We believe NIM and credit cost are the two main things investors need to watch regarding BBRI going forward.",
