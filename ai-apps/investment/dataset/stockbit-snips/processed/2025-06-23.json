      "title": "US Strikes Iran, Hormuz Strait Potentially Closed",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday (22/6) that the US military has attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities, marking direct US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict. The attack came only three days after the White House spokesperson said that the US decision to strike Iran would be determined within the next two weeks. In response, the Iranian parliament reportedly supports a plan to close the Strait of Hormuz, a shipping lane that carries about 20% of global oil supplies each day. However, the final decision to close the strait lies with Iran's National Security Council. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday (22/6) that he has contacted the Chinese government to prevent Iran from closing the strait. China is currently the largest importer of Iranian oil, with imports exceeding 1.8 million barrels per day in May 2025, according to vessel-tracking firm Vortexa. To date, Iran has not launched a retaliatory strike against the US. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country is considering all options to respond to the attack. Trump warned that if Iran retaliates against US assets, the United States will respond with greater force than the initial strike. Bloomberg reports that Iran currently lacks any alliance to confront the US, although China and Russia have condemned the US attack. Abbas said he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday (23/6), but Bloomberg noted that military assistance from China and Russia will be difficult because there is no formal military relationship with Iran. The only proxy militant group that has shown support for Iran is the Houthi movement, which has announced threats targeting commercial ships and US naval vessels. Key Takeaway: In response to these developments, September 2025 Brent futures briefly jumped +5.2% to $79.4 per barrel on Monday (23/6) before falling to $76.1 intraday (+0.8%) as there was no immediate concrete response from Iran, indicating that Middle East oil supplies remain largely uninterrupted despite the escalating conflict. Stock markets reacted muted in the afternoon, with the Nikkei down -0.13%, EURO STOXX 50 down -0.44%, and S&P Futures down -0.05%. The Indonesian IDX composite (IHSG) fell -1.74%, driven mainly by large-cap stocks such as $DSSA (-5.91%), $BREN (-4.13%) and $BBRI (-1.85%). We assess that the market is still waiting to see how far Iran will respond to the US strike before prices react further, and this situation should be closely monitored by investors.",
