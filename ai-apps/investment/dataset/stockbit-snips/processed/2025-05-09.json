      "content": "Coordinator of Food Affairs Minister Zulkifli Hasan said on Thursday (8 May) that the government will no longer import rice in 2025, as domestic production and stock have risen sharply. Indonesia produced 8.61 million tonnes of rice in the first quarter of 2025, a 53 percent year-on-year increase. Perum Bulog reported that the government’s rice reserve stock at Bulog warehouses reached 3.6 million tonnes at the beginning of May 2025, the highest level in the past 57 years. In a press conference on Friday (2 May), BPS projected that total rice production for the first half of 2025 could reach 18.76 million tonnes, an 11.2 percent year-on-year increase, supported by favorable weather and a significant expansion of harvested area to 6.22 million hectares, up 11.9 percent year-on-year. In addition, the US Department of Agriculture’s report in April 2025 estimated that Indonesia’s rice production for the 2024/2025 cropping season would rise 4.8 percent year-on-year to 34.6 million tonnes, the highest projected volume in Southeast Asia. The government targets national rice production at 32.8 million tonnes for 2025. The increase reflects a post-El Niño recovery in 2023, which had pushed domestic rice prices up about 20 percent year-on-year in March 2024. The abundant supply also led to a 1-2 percent year-on-year decline in rice prices in April 2025, continuing a 4-9 percent decline in March 2025. Key Takeaway: The rise in domestic production and stock can limit the risk of a rice price surge like that seen in early 2024. Rice prices have been relatively stable since the second half of 2024. If rice management remains effective, production growth can continue without a sharp price drop, which would benefit consumer purchasing power and farmer income. Moreover, the elimination of rice imports can reduce Indonesia’s import bill. Over the ten months of 2024, BPS recorded that Indonesia imported 3.48 million tonnes of rice worth USD 2.2 billion (approximately IDR 34.2 trillion).",

      "content": "1. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday (8 May) agreed on a trade framework between the two countries, marking the first trade agreement the US has signed with a partner since Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in April 2025. Trump praised the deal as a \"breakthrough\" that could open further agreements to expand market access for US goods. Under the framework, the UK will accelerate customs clearance for US goods and reduce barriers on agricultural, chemical, energy and industrial exports. The UK government said the US will cut automotive import tariffs to 10 percent and metal import tariffs to zero. Final details will be negotiated over the coming weeks.\n2. Reuters reported that OPEC oil production in April 2025 fell to 26.6 million barrels per day, 30,000 barrels per day lower than March 2025, despite OPEC+ planning to raise output in April. The decline was mainly due to reduced output from Venezuela, where exports contracted after the cancellation of a cargo to Chevron (NYSE: CVX) amid US actions to disrupt Venezuelan oil exports.\n3. The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded that domestic motorcycle sales in April 2025 fell to 406,691 units (-3 percent year-on-year, -25 percent month-on-month). Cumulative sales for the first four months of 2025 reached about 2.1 million units (-3 percent year-on-year), representing 31-33 percent of the 2025 target of 6.4-6.7 million units.\n4. Bank Indonesia reported that the Indonesian Consumer Confidence Index rose to 121.7 in April 2025 (vs. 121.1 in March 2025), the first increase in four months. The rise was driven by a +3.1-point increase in the current economic conditions index, while the consumer expectations index fell by 1.9 points due to lower expectations for job availability (-2.4 points) and business activity (-3.7 points).\n5. Budihardjo Iduansjah, Chairman of the Indonesian Retailers and Shopping Center Tenants Association (Hippindo), said the association sees a potential reduction in retail employment due to store rationalisation. Although no official data from members are available, Hippindo warns that the trend of store closures should be monitored. He explained that the retail sector overall is underperforming, highlighted by weak sales during the 2025 Lebaran period compared with previous years.\n6. Djoko Widajatno, member of the Advisory Council of the Indonesian Nickel Mining Association, said the Philippines' plan to ban nickel ore exports starting June 2025 could significantly affect Indonesian nickel smelters. Indonesia imported about 10 million tonnes of nickel ore from the Philippines in 2024, mainly for the Morowali and Weda Bay smelters. The ban could tighten global nickel ore supply and push prices up, offering short-term benefits to Indonesian nickel producers but raising operational costs for smelters.\n7. Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said on Thursday (8 May) that the government will stop importing oil from Singapore within six months, replacing it with imports from Middle Eastern countries and the United States. The decision is based on price parity with Middle Eastern oil and geopolitical considerations. Kontan reported that 54-59 percent of Indonesia’s oil imports currently come from Singapore.\n8. Bitcoin again broke the US$100,000 level on Thursday (8 May), the first time since February 2025, though still below the all-time high of around US$109,000 set in January 2025. The rise occurred after the US-UK trade agreement was announced, raising optimism about de-escalation of trade tensions.\n9. Sheila Aryyani Hanusanti, General Manager of Marketing at Milk Cisarua Mountain Dairy (CMRY), said the company launched a new dessert product called \"Cimory Eat Milk\" nationwide on 1 May 2025. The product is packaged in pouches and is offered in three flavours, targeting Indonesian consumers who like to have a sweet snack after a heavy meal.\n10. Robert Francis Prevost was elected as the 267th Pope. Prevost, born in the United States and holding Peruvian citizenship, is the first Pope born in the United States and the second from South America. He chose the papal name Leo XIV.",

The plan had been delayed in 2024 due to a disagreement between the company and OJK over the definition of current-year profit.
