      "title": "DHE SDA Revised, Government Provides Flexibility",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto on Monday (17/2) officially issued Government Regulation No. 8/2025 requiring the placement of all foreign exchange from natural resource export (DHE SDA) within the country for one year. The policy becomes effective on 1 March 2025. The new regulation does not apply to the oil and gas sector, where the implementation of DHE SDA placement will still refer to Government Regulation No. 36/2023 with a placement of 30 percent for three months. President Prabowo estimates that the revision will increase foreign exchange stored in domestic banks by 80 billion US dollars by the end of 2025 or more than 100 billion US dollars within twelve months from implementation. The revision aims to increase the supply of foreign exchange to ease the rupiah's pressure against the US dollar recently. Although the share and tenor increase, the revision gives exporters the ability to use foreign exchange placed in a special account for several purposes, namely: 1) conversion to rupiah in the same bank for business operations; 2) payment of tax obligations, state revenue, and other obligations to the government; 3) payment of dividends in foreign currency; 4) payment for procurement of goods and services not yet available domestically; 5) repayment of loans for capital goods procurement in foreign currency. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said the government will ensure that the DHE SDA policy does not cause disruption for companies. Several association representatives indicated they do not object to the new regulation. According to the Executive Director of the Indonesia Mining Association, Hendra Sinadia, the revision gives exporters room to maintain cash flow. Key Takeaway: The revision of DHE SDA placement potentially provides positive sentiment for banking issuers due to added foreign exchange liquidity. With flexibility allowing the use of export foreign exchange for operational and financial needs, we assess that the revision does not have a too significant impact on the continuity of natural resource exporters' businesses. Bloomberg consensus expects Bank Indonesia to keep the BI Rate at 5.75 percent in the Governor Board meeting on Wednesday (19/2). The House of Representatives on Tuesday (18/2) passed an amendment to the Mining Law, aiming to increase downstream processing and access for religious community organizations and MSMEs. The amendment allows priority access for mining concessions to companies that intend to build processing facilities, considering investment size, added value, and job creation. It also allows religious community organizations and MSMEs priority access to certain mining areas, previously granted only to state-owned enterprises. Universities were previously included but were removed in the final draft. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday (17/2) led a meeting with leading Chinese entrepreneurs, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Bloomberg reported that this indicates a return of Chinese government support for the private sector to revive the economy after a series of crackdowns in 2020, although the extent of policy change remains unclear. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Monday (17/2) said OPEC+ is not considering delaying the monthly oil supply increase scheduled to start in April 2025. The statement came after Bloomberg reported that OPEC+ was reviewing a possible delay despite a request from US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices. Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi on Tuesday (18/2) said the ministry is studying the implementation of a 50 percent biodiesel blend (B50) in 2026 and also targeting a 3 percent CPO blend for jet fuel in 2026. Nikkei Asia reported that Apple is discussing with several suppliers the possibility of establishing an iPhone factory in Indonesia, driven by a ban on iPhone 16 sales in Indonesia since October 2024 due to the lack of a domestic component certificate (TKDN). If built, Indonesia would become the second Southeast Asian country after Vietnam with iPhone production facilities. Humpuss Maritim Internasional ($HUMI) through its subsidiary PT Hutama Trans Kencana purchased one oil tanker from PT Patria Nusasegara for 7.05 million US dollars. The transaction is intended for the development of the fuel oil distribution business. The Indonesia Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading of Wijaya Karya ($WIKA) after the company announced a postponement of principal payments on sukuk and bonds due on 18 February 2025. The exchange said the announcement indicated problems with the company's business continuity. Previously, WIKA had proposed partial repayment and an extension of the remaining principal of bonds and sukuk mudharabah for two years, but the relevant committees could not reach a decision on the proposal.",
