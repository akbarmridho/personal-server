      "content": "26 March 2025 ‚Äì The compilation of 2024 issuer performance (Part 1) summarizes the financial results of issuers that are closely related to consumers, covering the banking, consumer staples, dairy, poultry, retail, tobacco, healthcare, and media sectors. The section presents revenue, operating profit, and net profit for each sector. The key takeaways note that overall consumer-related sectors performed well in 4Q24 and FY24, with top-line growth above +6% YoY in both periods. Operating profit margin remained relatively stable, resulting in a total operating profit increase of +5.6% YoY in 4Q24 and +7.2% YoY in FY24. Margin compression in consumer staples, dairy, retail and tobacco was offset by gains in banking and poultry. Net profit fell ‚Äì1.6% YoY in 4Q24, driven by foreign-exchange losses at consumer-staples firm $ICBP and higher provisions at several banks, but FY24 net profit grew +4.8% YoY, led by banking, poultry and dairy.\n\nHighlights per industry: ‚Ä¢ Banking remained the largest net-profit contributor in FY24, driven mainly by $BBCA (+13% YoY) and $NISP (+19% YoY), while the other three big banks posted only +0-3% YoY. Credit growth was strong for BBCA and $BMRI, both exceeding FY24 guidance, whereas $BBRI‚Äôs provision surge made it the only big bank with a cost-of-credit worse than its guidance. ‚Ä¢ Poultry posted the highest YoY net-profit growth in FY24, helped by a 5% YoY drop in average corn prices and price increases of DOC (+28% YoY) and broiler (+3% YoY). ‚Ä¢ Media, healthcare and dairy also posted double-digit net-profit growth in FY24. ‚Ä¢ Consumer staples (notably $UNVR) and tobacco saw net-profit declines due to lower volumes, higher excise and down-trading.\n",
