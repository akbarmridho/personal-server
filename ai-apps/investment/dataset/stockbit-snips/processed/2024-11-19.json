      "content": "Economists expect Bank Indonesia to keep the BI Rate at 6% during the Governing Board meeting on Wednesday 20 November, according to a Reuters survey. The same survey also expects the BI Rate to be cut by 25 basis points to 5.75% in December 2024, a smaller reduction than previously forecast, due to a weaker rupiah against the US dollar as a result of the positive sentiment surrounding Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. Kontan reported that the Indonesian Employers Association (Apindo), the Indonesian Textile Association (API), and the Association of Retailers and Shopping Center Tenants (Hipindo) have asked the government to postpone the planned increase of the value‑added tax (VAT) to 12% that was scheduled to start in early 2025, arguing that consumer purchasing power is still unstable and the hike would suppress demand and hurt industry. According to Kompas, President Prabowo Subianto had promised in January 2024 not to raise tax rates if elected in the 2024 election. The House of Representatives has proposed a tax amnesty bill as a national legislative priority for 2025, which would become the third tax amnesty program in the past decade after the 2016‑2017 and 2022 rounds. The Ministry of Investment and Downstream/ BKPM Regulation No. 1/2024 grants a 0% import duty and a government‑covered luxury goods sales tax (PPnBM) for electric vehicles, both fully built up (CBU) and completely knocked down (CKD), with local content ranging from 20% to 40%. The incentive applies only to importers from countries that have an international agreement with Indonesia and to firms that will build electric‑vehicle factories in Indonesia, as well as existing conventional‑vehicle manufacturers that will shift to electric vehicles. SKK Migas reported that upstream oil and gas investment during the first ten months of 2024 reached US$10.3 billion, up 1% year‑on‑year, achieving only 58.2% of the 2024 target of US$17.7 billion. Director Djoko Siswanto projected that total upstream investment could reach US$16 billion for the full year, a 16.6% year‑on‑year increase, but noted that delays in domestic component (TKDN) availability have hampered project progress and also affected oil and gas lifting, which reached 1.56 million BOEPD, 94% of the 2024 budget target of 1.66 million BOEPD. National coal production reached 711.37 million tonnes as of 15 November 2024, slightly above the government’s 2024 target of 710 million tonnes but still far below the 2024 work plan and budget target of 922.14 million tonnes. The Acting Executive Director of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association (APBI), Gita Mahyarani, forecasts total 2024 coal output around 800 million tonnes, compared with 775 million tonnes in 2023. Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. has increased its proposed investment in Indonesia to almost US$100 million over the next two years, up from a previous US$10 million proposal, in an effort to persuade the government to lift the ban on the iPhone 16 series. The ban remains because the device lacks the required domestic component (TKDN) certificate; the government will issue the certificate after Apple fulfills an investment commitment of IDR 1.7 trillion, of which it has already met IDR 1.5 trillion.",

      "title": "BBCA 10M24: Net Profit +15% YoY, Loan Growth Strengthens",
      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recorded a net profit (bank only) of IDR 5.9 trillion in October 2024, up 34% month‑on‑month and 19% year‑on‑year. This result raised the net profit (bank only) for the first ten months of 2024 to IDR 46.2 trillion, a 15% year‑on‑year increase. The performance was driven by: 1) continued strengthening of loan growth; 2) a rebound in Net Interest Margin (NIM); and 3) a reversal of provision expenses. Loan growth: BBCA’s bank‑only loan portfolio grew 14.2% year‑on‑year during the first ten months of 2024, exceeding management’s FY24 consolidated guidance range of 10‑12%. This increase outpaced the growth of third‑party funds (DPK), which rose only 2.7% year‑on‑year, pushing the loan‑to‑deposit ratio (LDR) to 78%. The LDR remains lower than that of other big banks: as of September 2024, BMRI’s LDR was 93.7%, BBRI’s 89.6%, and BBNI’s 95.3%. NIM rebound: BBCA posted an NIM of 5.93% in October 2024, up 18 basis points month‑on‑month and 39 basis points year‑on‑year, the second‑highest monthly level since 2022. The NIM for the first ten months of 2024 rose to 5.7%, up 21 basis points year‑on‑year, in line with management’s FY24 consolidated guidance of 5.7‑5.8%. The NIM improvement was driven by a shift in asset mix toward higher‑yielding assets, including moving funds from Bank Indonesia deposits to government bonds and loans. Provision reversal: BBCA recorded a reversal of provision expenses amounting to IDR 341 billion in October 2024 (September 2024 provision expense was IDR 541 billion). This reduced the credit cost for the first ten months of 2024 to 0.22%, better than the management’s FY24 guidance range of 0.3‑0.4%. Dividend from subsidiaries: Net profit was also boosted by dividend receipts from subsidiaries of IDR 1.1 trillion in October 2024, bringing total dividend income for the first ten months of 2024 to IDR 2.3 trillion. Although these dividends are classified as non‑interest income in the bank‑only financial statements, they will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Key takeaway: The bank‑only performance of BBCA in October 2024 is positive, especially due to strong loan growth and solid NIM. While loan growth aligns with management guidance, BBCA’s liquidity remains ample compared with other big banks, giving the bank room to maintain its cost of funds and expand lending. The improvement in credit cost also indicates preserved asset quality.",
