      "content": "Bank Central Asia (BBCA) reported net profit for the bank-only segment of IDR 5 trillion in May 2025 (+12% YoY, +10% MoM). This result brings the bank-only net profit for the first five months of 2025 (5M25) to IDR 25.2 trillion (+16% YoY). Excluding dividend income, net profit for 5M25 grew +10% YoY, higher than the consensus estimate for consolidated 2025 net profit of +6.6% YoY. Net Interest Income (NII) and Non-Interest Income (Non-II), excluding dividend income, grew solidly by +7% YoY each during 5M25. Operating expenses (OPEX) remained efficient, increasing only +4% YoY during 5M25. Consequently, Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP), excluding dividend receipts, rose +8% during 5M25. Including dividends, Non-II grew +22% YoY during 5M25. Although dividends from subsidiaries are recorded as Non-II in the bank-only financial statements, they will be eliminated in the consolidated statements. Monthly, both Net Interest Margin (NIM) and credit cost (CoC) improved after the April 2025 spread widening. NIM was 5.86% in May 2025 (vs. April 5.56%), while CoC was 0.18% in May 2025 (vs. April 0.59%). This yields a 5M25 NIM realization of 5.73%, in line with the 2025 management guidance of 5.7-5.8%. CoC realization for 5M25 was 0.37%, still above the 2025 guidance of 0.3%. BBCA's liquidity remains good with a Loan-to-Deposit Ratio of 80% and a CASA ratio that rose to 83.2% in May 2025, supported by Current Account growth of +12% YoY, +4% MoM. The solid liquidity supports credit growth of +12% YoY in May 2025. Key Takeaway: The bank-only performance of BBCA in 5M25 is considered positive. NIM is within guidance, CoC is still above guidance but improving in May 2025. Loan growth remains strong though slowing in line with management targets. Interest income rose to IDR 8 trillion in May 2025 (+9% YoY, +4% MoM), indicating a possible rise in lending yield, as noted by management.",

BRMS targets its underground gold mine in Palu, Central Sulawesi, to start operating in 4Q27.
