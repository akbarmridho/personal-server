      "title": "RI Inflation in 2023 Eased to 2.61%, Below Expectations",
      "content": "BPS noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in Indonesia in December 2023 eased to a level of 2.61% YoY (vs. November 2023: 2.86% YoY, December 2022: 5.51% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation which projected inflation of 2.72% YoY. This realization is in line with Bank Indonesia's target to keep inflation during 2023 at the 2-4% level. The decline in the annual inflation rate in December 2023 also differs from the trend in recent years, where since 2019 inflation tended to increase at the end of the year. The easing inflation in December 2023 was specifically caused by the high base effect due to the increase in fuel prices at the end of 2022. On a monthly basis, CPI inflation in December 2023 reached 0.41% MoM (vs. November 2023: 0.38% MoM). This realization was lower than the consensus expectation which projected 0.5% MoM inflation, but marked the highest monthly inflation in the last 12 months. Meanwhile, core inflation in December 2023 eased to 1.8% YoY (vs. November 2023: 1.87% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation which projected core inflation at 1.85% YoY. Based on expenditure groups, monthly and annual CPI inflation in December 2023 was driven by food, beverages, and tobacco which experienced inflation of 1.07% MoM and 6.18% YoY. This expenditure group contributed 0.29% to monthly inflation in December 2023, with an annual inflation contribution of 1.6%. Responding to this inflation data release, the IHSG closed stronger by +0.7% at the level of 7,323 on Tuesday (2/1). Key Takeaway: The inflation rate being below expectations provides room for Bank Indonesia to start cutting the benchmark interest rate sooner than anticipated, especially with the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar having strengthened to 15,473 per 2 January 2024 and indications of interest rate cuts by The Fed. Currently, the consensus estimates that Bank Indonesia will start cutting interest rates in 3Q24. Interest rate cuts can have a positive impact on sectors sensitive to interest rate changes, such as: Banking: lower cost of fund can increase Net Interest Margin. Property: lower mortgage interest rates can boost property demand. Furthermore, our study also found that the stock prices of property issuers tend to rise when interest rates have reached their peak and begin to be cut.
