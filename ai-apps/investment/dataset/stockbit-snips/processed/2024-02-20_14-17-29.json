      "title": "Divestment Agreement for INCO Postponed to Next Week",
      "content": "Deputy Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, stated that the divestment agreement for 14% of Vale Indonesia (INCO) shares to MIND ID will be signed on February 26, 2024, postponed from the initial planned schedule which was supposed to take place this week. Kartika mentioned that the shareholders have agreed on the transaction price. However, his side could not disclose the value amount as it is material public information. The divestment price for INCO shares to MIND ID is currently uncertain. On Friday (16/2), Kontan reported that the transaction price was 3,070 Rupiah per share. However, on Monday (19/2), IDN Financials reported that the divestment of INCO shares would be executed at a price of 3,750 Rupiah per share. After this divestment, MIND ID's share ownership in INCO will increase to 34%, making it the largest shareholder. Special Staff to the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises, Arya Sinulingga, stated that the government will overhaul the board of commissioners and directors of INCO once the divestment is complete. Last week, INCO announced the resignation of 2 people from its board of commissioners. Key Takeaway As we have written in the previous Stockbit commentary, we predict that the INCO stock price movement has the potential to be volatile in line with the developments in the divestment process. On Friday (16/2), the INCO stock price weakened -7.75% following news of the divestment at a price of 3,070 Rupiah per share. However, on Monday (19/2), the INCO stock price rebounded +4.34% following news of a transaction price of 3,750 Rupiah per share. Although the divestment price for 14% of INCO shares has the potential to be lower than the market price, we assess that there is little chance the market price will drop to the same level. This is considering that this divestment is a prerequisite for INCO to obtain an extension of the IUPK concession, so it is reasonable for the government to obtain a lower price. In the long run, we see INCO's stock performance will be influenced by: 1) the movement of nickel selling prices which are currently under pressure, and 2) the development of nickel downstream projects that are currently under construction.",
