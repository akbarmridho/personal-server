      "content": "The US economy contracted by -0.3% annualized in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: +2.4% annualized), according to the initial estimate from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. This result is far lower than the consensus expectation which projected +0.3% annualized growth, simultaneously marking the first contraction since 1Q22. On an annual basis, the US economy still grew +2% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24: +2.5% YoY), but this marks the first growth slowdown since 4Q22. The weakening US economy in 1Q25 occurred alongside a surge in imports of +41.3% QoQ and +13.4% YoY, amid inventory building in anticipation of tariff hikes. On the other hand, trade war sentiment between the US and China began to ease. On Friday (2/5), the Chinese government stated it was evaluating the possibility of tariff negotiations with the US. Nevertheless, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce affirmed that it would only negotiate if the US first canceled tariffs on Chinese goods. Following the positive sentiment from the potential de-escalation of the trade war, the price of gold fell to the level of 3,260 US dollars per troy ounce on Friday (2/5), after reaching an all-time high of 3,423 US dollars per troy ounce on April 21, 2025. The US Dollar Index (DXY) also improved by +0.35% WoW to the level of 99.82 as of Friday (2/5), after briefly falling to its lowest level since March 2022 at 98.27 on April 21, 2025. In Indonesia itself, the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar strengthened by +2.35% WoW to the level of 16,435 on Friday (2/5), improving from its all-time low of 16,870 on April 24, 2025. On Friday (2/5), the IHSG also strengthened by +0.72% and the Indonesian government bond yield for the 10-year tenor fell about -5 bps to the level of 6.88%.",

      "content": "The prospects of trade negotiations between the US and China have the potential to make the US economic slowdown smoother than previously feared. This can provide positive sentiment for the general market (risk-on), especially emerging markets. Nevertheless, the potential flow shift (from the US market) will still depend on the growth prospects of the respective countries. Domestically, a more stable rupiah exchange rate can loosen the room for Bank Indonesia to cut the BI Rate to help boost economic growth.",

      "content": "1. Consensus economists surveyed by Reuters expect Indonesia's economic growth to slow down to +4.91% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24 realization: +5.02% YoY). Quarterly, consensus economists estimate Indonesia's economy will contract -0.89% QoQ in 1Q25 (vs. 4Q24 realization: +0.53% QoQ). This expectation is based on increasing uncertainty regarding global trade and low government spending in 1Q25. Indonesia's Q1 2025 economic growth data will only be released on May 5, 2025. 2. BPS noted that Indonesia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose to 1.95% YoY in April 2025 (vs. March 2025: 1.03% YoY inflation), marking the highest level since August 2024 following the Eid effect. Monthly, CPI inflation eased to 1.17% MoM (vs. March 2025: 1.65% MoM inflation). Core inflation rose to 2.5% YoY (vs. March 2025: 2.48% YoY inflation), marking the highest level in the last 22 months. 3. S&P Global noted that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in April 2025 plummeted to the level of 46.7 (vs. March 2024: 52.4), marking the first contraction in factory activity in 6 months and the sharpest decline since August 2021. 4. The Ministry of Finance noted that the 2025 State Budget deficit as of 1Q25 reached 104.2 trillion rupiah or 0.43% of GDP. Nevertheless, the primary balance is still in a surplus of 17.5 trillion rupiah. The 2025 State Budget targets a deficit of 2.53% of GDP and a primary balance deficit of 63.3 trillion rupiah. 5. S&P Global noted that China's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in April 2025 fell to 50.4 (vs. March 2025: 51.2), but exceeded the consensus expectation of 49.8. This result marked the seventh consecutive month of expansion in factory activity, although it was the weakest growth since January 2025. This data indicates that the stimulus measures taken by the Chinese government still support the country's economic recovery. 6. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that job vacancies in the US in March 2025 decreased by 288,000 to the level of 7.19 million (vs. February 2025: 7.48 million), below the consensus expectation of 7.48 million and marking the lowest level in the last 6 months. 7. Barito Renewables Energy (BREN) recorded net profit of 34 million US dollars in 1Q25 (+19% YoY, -5% QoQ). The annual increase in net profit was primarily driven by a decrease in net financing costs to 26 million US dollars (-8% YoY, -8% QoQ) from refinancing conducted in September 2024, as well as an exchange rate difference gain of 1 million US dollars (1Q24: loss 1 million US dollars, 4Q24: gain 2 million US dollars). Based on Stockbit calculations, BREN's EBITDA reached 126 million US dollars in 1Q25 (+3% YoY, -5% QoQ). 8. Advisor and brother of President Prabowo Subianto, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, told Reuters that the government plans to build 10 GW of nuclear power plants (PLTN). This plan is part of an addition of 103 GW of electricity capacity by 2040. Besides nuclear, this additional electricity capacity will come from 75 GW derived from solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass, and the remaining 18 GW will come from gas. Currently, Indonesia has a power generation capacity of 90 GW, with only 15 GW derived from renewable energy. 9. BPS noted that foreign tourist (wisman) arrivals in Indonesia reached approximately 841 thousand people in March 2025 (-2.2% YoY, -5.6% MoM). This result brought the total wisman arrivals to approximately 2.7 million people during 1Q25 (+7.8% YoY), equivalent to 17-20% of the government's 2025 target, which is in the range of 14-16 million people.",

This surge caused the operating profit margin to drop to 9% (vs. 1Q24: 13.3%, 4Q24: 17.8%), resulting in operating profit reaching only 192 billion rupiah (-28% YoY, -54% QoQ) and below expectations as it represented 17% of the 2025F consensus estimate (vs. last 3 years: ~22%).",
