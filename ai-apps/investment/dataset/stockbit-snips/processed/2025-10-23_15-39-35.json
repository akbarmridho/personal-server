      "content": "Bank Indonesia recorded that the money supply in a broad sense (M2) in September 2025 grew by +8% YoY to 9,771.3 trillion rupiah (vs. August 2025: +7.6% YoY). This development was driven by the growth of the narrow money supply (M1) by +10.7% YoY and quasi money by +6.2% YoY. Bloomberg reports that Danantara has recruited 2 former investment professionals from GIC Pte., Daniel Lim and Weihan Wong, as investment directors who will cover the global private market. Bloomberg sources stated that Lim will be assigned to study private credit opportunities, while Wong will be responsible for private equity. Both are reported to carry a global investment mandate, with an initial focus on opportunities in Indonesia. Danantara representatives declined to comment on this news to Bloomberg. The US on Wednesday (22/10) announced new sanctions targeting Russia's two largest oil companies - Rosneft and Lukoil - in an effort to pressure Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The sanctions announcement came 1 day after US President Donald Trump stated that the planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest would be postponed indefinitely. Finance Minister, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that the government does not plan to increase the BPJS Health contribution tariff in 2026. Previously, the plan for an increase in the BPJS Health contribution was included in book II of the financial notes along with the 2026 Draft State Budget. Purbaya mentioned that the government will still focus on recovering the domestic economy first. However, Purbaya opens the opportunity to increase the BPJS Health contribution tariff if the Indonesian economy can grow above +6%. Additionally, Purbaya also announced that the government has prepared approximately 20 trillion rupiah to clear the arrears of BPJS Health contributions, although he did not specify the number of participants whose arrears would be cleared.",

In 3Q25, UNVR recorded revenue growth of +12% YoY, marking the first annual growth since 3Q23. Although the annual growth level was also caused by a low-base effect in 3Q24, the quarterly revenue level also increased by +8% QoQ and was at a relatively similar level to 1Q25, the period when revenue was boosted by the Eid effect. Positive revenue in 3Q25 was driven by solid volume growth, where UNVR posted an increase in underlying volume in the domestic market of +10% YoY. Segmentally, the 'Home & Personal Care' segment experienced a recovery, recording a revenue growth of +15% YoY, after successively contracting since 4Q23.",

On the other hand, PBT from the 'industrial estate' segment was recorded at 79 billion rupiah in 3Q25 (+154% YoY, -66% QoQ) due to weak land sales at JIIPE.
