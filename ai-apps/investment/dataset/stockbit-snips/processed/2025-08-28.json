      "title": "EXCL 2Q25: Net Loss Rp1.6 Trillion, Below Expectations",
      "content": "XLSmart Telecom Sejahtera (EXCL) recorded a net loss of 1.6 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: profit of 385 billion rupiah, 2Q24: profit of 484 billion rupiah). This result makes the net loss for EXCL in the first half of 2025 amount to 1.2 trillion rupiah (vs. 1H24: profit of 1 trillion rupiah), below the 2025F consensus estimate that projected a net profit of 1.5 trillion rupiah. Key points: Number of mobile subscribers rose to 82.6 million in 2Q25 (+41% YoY, +40% QoQ), below the initial estimate of 94.5 million. Management explained that the lower subscriber base compared to the estimate was due to harmonisation of subscriber definitions after the merger. Average revenue per user (ARPU) for mobile fell to 36 thousand rupiah in 2Q25 (-14% YoY, -5% QoQ) because the ARPU of Smartfren customers was lower (2024: 24 thousand rupiah) compared to XL Axiata (2024: 43 thousand rupiah). Increase in costs across all expense categories after the merger: The quarterly net loss in 2Q25 was caused by a more aggressive rise in total expenses than revenue growth. The main expense increase came from salaries and employee costs, reaching 1.1 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (+139% YoY, +114% QoQ) due to higher headcount, and infrastructure costs of 3 trillion rupiah (+39% YoY, +29% QoQ) due to more sites and regulatory costs from additional spectrum obtained after the merger. All these expenses pushed the post-tax loss to 1.6 trillion rupiah in 2Q25. Nevertheless, EXCL reported a normalized profit after tax of 313 billion rupiah in 2Q25 (-36% YoY, -19% QoQ) when excluding one-off items such as integration costs (379 billion rupiah), accelerated depreciation (739 billion rupiah), and asset impairment (802 billion rupiah). The asset impairment recorded in 2Q25 relates to assets held for the 900 MHz frequency band, which will be returned by EXCL at the end of 2026. Guidance for 2025: EBITDA margin around 40-45%. Following the post-merger release, management announced an initial guidance for 2025 with revenue growth target of +20-30% YoY (vs. +12% YoY in 1H25) and an EBITDA margin of 40-45% (vs. 46% in 1H25). Management also anticipates additional integration costs of 1 trillion rupiah in 2H25 and expects a reduction in opex of about 100-200 million US dollars (equivalent to 1.6-3.2 trillion rupiah) this year. Key Takeaway: After the financial release, EXCL shares fell 6.8% to 2,760 rupiah per share on Wednesday (27/8). We assess that the market reacted negatively due to the larger-than-expected integration cost realization. Going forward, EXCL performance through the end of 2025 will remain challenging because of (1) projected additional integration costs up to 1 trillion rupiah in 2H25 and (2) continued accelerated depreciation related to 900 MHz equipment and legacy vendor assets. This is also reflected in the expected decline of EBITDA margin from 46% in 2Q25 to a range of 40-45% for 2025, partly due to the lower EBITDA margin of FREN.",

      "content": "1. Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto told Reuters on Tuesday (26/8) that the United States has essentially agreed to grant near-zero tariffs for Indonesian cocoa, palm oil, and rubber, which were previously subject to a 19% tariff imposed by former President Donald Trump. Hartarto claimed the tariff exemption will take effect after both parties reach a final agreement, but no schedule has been set because the U.S. is busy negotiating tariffs with other countries. The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta has not responded to Hartarto's claim.\n2. Thousands of workers from various regions will hold a demonstration on Thursday (28/8) at the DPR RI building and the Presidential Palace, Jakarta.

The decision follows a trend of interest-rate reductions and aims to strengthen economic performance while reaffirming policy synergy.\n4. Bloomberg reported that Danantara has signed a master agreement worth USD 1.42 billion with GEM Co. Ltd. to develop an HPAL smelter with a production capacity of 66,000 tonnes of nickel MHP per year.
