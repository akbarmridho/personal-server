      "title": "BI Holds Interest Rate, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia decided to hold the BI Rate at the level of 5.75% today, Wednesday (19/2), with the deposit facility and lending facility also maintained at 5% and 6.5% respectively. This decision is in line with consensus expectations. Bank Indonesia Governor, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision is an effort to stabilize the rupiah exchange rate, keep inflation under control, and encourage economic growth. Perry mentioned that they see room for further reduction in the BI Rate, mainly due to low inflation and to support economic growth. Nevertheless, Perry explained that the timing of the next BI Rate cut will depend on global dynamics. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg consensus expects the BI Rate to still decrease by another 50 bps to the level of 5.25% by the end of 2025. Bank Indonesia still maintains its expectation of a 25 bps interest rate cut by the Fed during 2025, the same as the expectation last month and in line with consensus expectations based on the CME FedWatch Tool analysis as of Wednesday (19/2). Perry emphasized efforts to maintain the stability of the rupiah exchange rate through the optimization of pro-market monetary instruments, such as SRBI, SVBI, and SUVBI. In addition, the revision of the implementation rules for export proceeds from natural resources effective March 1, 2025, is expected to support the stability of the rupiah exchange rate going forward. Bank Indonesia also increased the macroprudential liquidity incentive (KLM) from a previous maximum of 4% of DPK to a maximum of 5% of DPK. Furthermore, the amount of KLM incentives for the housing sector - including public housing - will be gradually increased starting April 1, 2025, from 23 trillion rupiahs to around 80 trillion rupiahs to support government housing programs. On Wednesday (19/2), the IHSG fell by -1.14%, with the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar weakening by -0.42% to the level of 16,339, and the 10-year government bond yield rising by +14 bps to the level of 6.901%. Key Takeaway: This decision was met negatively by the market, with the IHSG posting a net foreign outflow in the regular market of 964 billion rupiah today, stopping the foreign inflow trend of the previous 2 days. Sectors sensitive to interest rates - such as banking/finance (-1.78%) and property (-0.80%) - experienced declines today. On the other hand, the increase in KLM incentives can be good news for the banking sector, considering that liquidity conditions tend to be tight.",

Gita's statement came after the coal price touched the level of 102 US dollars per ton on Tuesday (18/2), approaching the lowest level in the last 4 years. Furthermore, a prolonged decline in coal prices will be felt first by miners located in regions with high logistics tariffs, such as Central Kalimantan and Jambi. Gita also explained that the decline in coal prices is closely related to the increase in production this year targeted by the world's 2 largest importers, China and India.",

This revenue recovery was supported by sales volume growth of +11.7% YoY in 4Q24, resulting in a YoY sales volume increase of +7.4% for 2024. Although the gross profit margin in 4Q24 slightly decreased to 34.3% (-20 bps QoQ, -60 bps YoY), the recovery in revenue growth managed to increase the EBIT margin to 20.1% (+0 bps QoQ, +30 bps YoY).",
