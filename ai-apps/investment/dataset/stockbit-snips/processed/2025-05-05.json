      "title": "Indonesia Economy +4.87% YoY in 1Q25, Weakest since 3Q21",
      "content": "Indonesia's Central Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that the country's economy grew only 4.87 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the first quarter of 2025, compared with 5.11 percent YoY in 1Q24 and 5.02 percent YoY in 4Q24. This fell short of the consensus forecast of 4.91 percent YoY and marked the weakest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2021. The result is also below the government’s 2025 target of 5.2 percent YoY, although it remains within Bank Indonesia’s target range of roughly 4.7-5.5 percent YoY.\n\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP contracted 0.98 percent in 1Q25 (vs. a 0.83 percent contraction in 1Q24), again weaker than the consensus expectation of a 0.89 percent decline.\n\nThe slowdown in annual growth was driven by weaker household consumption, which rose only 4.89 percent YoY versus 4.91 percent YoY in 1Q24, and a drop in government consumption of 1.42 percent YoY versus a 19.9 percent increase in 1Q24. The decline occurred amid the Lebaran season, government incentive programmes, and tighter fiscal spending.\n\nBPS head Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti attributed the weakening of household and government consumption to a high-base effect from the 2024 general election. She also noted that the impact of the 2025 state-budget efficiency measures ordered by President Prabowo Subianto in January 2025 on government consumption will become more visible in 2Q25.\n\nIn addition to consumption, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) also weakened, growing only 2.12 percent YoY versus 3.78 percent YoY in 1Q24, reflecting a “wait-and-see” attitude among investors toward global economic developments.\n\nAnnual GDP growth in 1Q25 was supported mainly by net exports, which contributed 0.83 percentage points (vs. 0.06 pp in 1Q24), and other variables contributing 0.86 pp (vs. 0.16 pp in 1Q24).\n\nBy sector, agriculture posted the largest contribution, expanding 10.52 percent YoY (vs. a 3.54 percent contraction in 1Q24) and adding 1.11 percentage points to GDP growth (vs. 0.07 pp in 4Q24 and –0.41 pp in 1Q24), driven by a bumper harvest of rice and corn.\n\nRegionally, growth was weakest in Maluku and Papua (+1.69 percent YoY), Bali and Nusa Tenggara (+3.12 percent YoY), Kalimantan (+4.32 percent YoY) and Sumatra (+4.85 percent YoY). Sulawesi and Java outperformed the national average, recording 6.4 percent YoY and 4.99 percent YoY respectively.\n\nIn a separate statement, National Development Planning Minister Rachmat Pambudy said on Monday (May 5) that the government targets GDP growth of about 5.8-6.3 percent YoY for 2026.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAlthough Indonesia’s economy could accelerate in the second half of 2025 as government spending rises and interest rates are cut, the ongoing US-China trade dispute creates uncertainty for future growth. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani warned that a 32 percent US tariff could shave 0.3-0.5 percentage points off Indonesia’s growth. Previously, the World Bank and IMF had lowered their 2025 growth outlooks from 5.1 percent YoY to 4.7 percent YoY.",
