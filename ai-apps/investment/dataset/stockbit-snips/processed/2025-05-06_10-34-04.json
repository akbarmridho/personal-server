      "content": "BPS noted that Indonesia's economic growth only reached +4.87% YoY in 1Q25 (vs. 1Q24: +5.11% YoY, 4Q24: +5.02% YoY), below the consensus expectation which projected +4.91% YoY, marking the weakest economic growth since 3Q21. This realization is lower than the government's 2025 target of +5.2% YoY, although it remains within Bank Indonesia's target range aspiring for growth around +4.7-5.5% YoY.Quarterly, Indonesia's economic growth contracted by -0.98% QoQ (vs. 1Q24: -0.83% QoQ), also lower than the consensus expectation of -0.89% QoQ.From the expenditure side, the slowdown in annual Indonesian economic growth was influenced by weakening household consumption (+4.89% YoY vs. 1Q24: +4.91% YoY) and a decrease in government consumption (-1.42% YoY vs. 1Q24: +19.9% YoY), amidst shifts in Lebaran seasonality, incentives for the public, and government budget efficiency.The Head of BPS, Amalia Adininggar Widyasanti, attributed the weakening household consumption and the decrease in government consumption to the high-base effect from the 2024 election. Amalia also stated that the impact of the 2025 State Budget efficiency instructed by President Prabowo Subianto in January 2025 on government consumption will be more visible in 2Q25.Besides household and government consumption, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) also weakened (+2.12% YoY, vs. 1Q24: +3.78% YoY) due to investors' wait and see attitude towards global economic developments.Indonesia's annual economic growth in 1Q25 was more driven by net exports with a contribution of 0.83 percentage point (vs. 1Q24: 0.06 percentage point) and other variables with a contribution of 0.86 percentage point (vs. 1Q24: 0.16 percentage point).Based on the business field, the agriculture sector (+10.52% YoY vs. 1Q24: -3.54% YoY) became the largest contributor to economic growth in 1Q25 with a contribution reaching 1.11 percentage point (vs. 4Q24: 0.07 percentage point, 1Q24: -0.41 percentage point), supported by the harvest of rice and corn crops.Spatially, weak economic growth was restrained by the Maluku and Papua region (+1.69% YoY), Bali and Nusa Tenggara (+3.12% YoY), Kalimantan (+4.32% YoY), and Sumatra (+4.85% YoY). Meanwhile, the Sulawesi and Java regions managed to record higher growth compared to national economic growth, reaching +6.4% YoY and +4.99% YoY, respectively.In a separate occasion, the Minister of National Development Planning, Rachmat Pambudy, said on Monday (5/5) that the government is targeting economic growth around +5.8-6.3% YoY during 2026.",
