      "title": "Pemerintah Deregulasi Kebijakan Impor & Kemudahan Berusaha",
      "content": "The Ministry of Trade officially announced a series of regulations aimed at deregulating import policies and facilitating business operations. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said that this step aligns with Indonesiaâ€™s accession to the OECD, the negotiations of the Indonesia-European Union Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IEU-CEPA), and the negotiations with the United States concerning non-tariff barriers.\n\nDeregulation of Import Policies\nTechnically, the Ministry of Trade revoked Ministerial Regulation (Permendag) No. 36 of 2023 in conjunction with No. 8 of 2024 and replaced them with the issuance of Permendag No. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24 of 2025.\n\nMinister of Trade Budi Susanto said that there are four priority groups of goods that are being relaxed (see table). Budi also mentioned that this deregulation package is the first package and can be followed by a second package.\n\nVice Minister of Finance Anggito Abimanyu said that the deregulation will be supported by faster and integrated import supervision systems. The Ministry will also accelerate the duration for applying remedial tariffs (protective duties) on certain products from 40 days to 14 days.\n\nDeregulation of Business Facilitation\nThe Ministry of Trade also eased franchise ownersâ€™ procedures by issuing Permendag No. 25 of 2025. Under this regulation, franchise owners may start operations even if the regional government has not yet issued a Franchise Registration Certificate (STPW) within five days after the STPW application. Previously, franchise owners had to wait for the issuance of the STPW before commencing business activities.\n\nKey Takeaway\nBased on existing regulations, importers must obtain an import permit (PI) that usually has a validity of up to one year. Therefore, the import relaxation that removes the need for a PI could provide greater ease and flexibility for importers.",

      "content": "1. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said that the state revenue realization for the first half of 2025 reached only IDR 1,201.8 trillion, a 9% year-on-year decline, representing just 40% of the 2025 state budget target. This is the lowest level in three years. By comparison, the first-half 2024 realization was 47% of the 2024 budget target, the first-half 2023 was 57%, and the first-half 2022 was 59%.\n\nShe explained that the decline was caused by weaker commodity prices, the diversion of state-owned enterprise dividends to the BPI Danantara, and the cancellation of the implementation of VAT 12%.\n\n2. Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia said the government plans to cut the mining quota period (RKAB) from three years to one year. The move aims to improve governance in the mining sector and to better control coal and ore supply. Previously, the RKAB was set for one year, but the government changed it to a three-year cycle in 2023 to ease bureaucracy.\n\n3. The U.S. Senate passed a $3.3â€¯trillion tax-cut and spending-reduction bill proposed by President Donald Trump on 1 July. The U.S. House of Representatives had passed the bill on 22 May 2025, and it will now return to the House for final approval after Senate amendments. If the U.S. House approves it, the bill would deliver a $4.5â€¯trillion tax cut and a $1.2â€¯trillion spending cut.\n\n4. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation No. 14/2025 to attract investment from oil-drilling technology providers to increase production from existing wells. Under the new policy, oil-field operators may partner with technology providers to boost output from idle or mature wells and fields, which are often neglected in favor of new, more economical wells. Deputy Minister of Energy Yuliot Tanjung said the government has identified about 2,500 wells and more than 100 fields or structures that could be opened for such partnerships.\n\n5. Bloomberg reported that PT Pertamina and its subsidiary PT Pertamina International Shipping are seeking a foreign loan of about US$700â€¯million with a ten-year tenor to build vessels. Bloomberg noted that the terms could change as negotiations are still in early stages.\n\n6. Bumi Resources (BUMI) announced that Yingbin Ian He and Jinping Ma have submitted their resignations as director and commissioner of the company, respectively.",
