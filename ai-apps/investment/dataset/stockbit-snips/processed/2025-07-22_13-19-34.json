      "title": "RI Coal Exports to China Drop -12% YoY in 1H25",
      "content": "China customs noted that coal imports from Indonesia in June 2025 plummeted -30% YoY to a level of approximately 11.6 million tons. This result brought China's coal imports from Indonesia during 1H25 to approximately 91 million tons, a decrease of -12% YoY. For context, Indonesia's coal exports to China still grew slightly during 1Q25 (+1% YoY), before starting to experience an annual decline in 4M25 (-5% YoY). The decline in China's imports of coal from Indonesia during 1H25 was deeper compared to imports from other countries, such as Russia (-4% YoY), Mongolia (-4% YoY), and Australia (-1% YoY). Generally, China's coal imports in June 2025 fell to approximately 33 million tons (-26% YoY, -8% MoM), marking the lowest monthly import since February 2023. This result caused China's total coal imports during 1H25 to drop -11% YoY to approximately 221.7 million tons. Reuters reported that the trend of declining coal imports from Indonesia to China occurs in line with increasing domestic coal production in China. Additionally, the decline in global coal prices has made high-quality coal—which produces more energy per ton—more cost-competitive, thus suppressing the demand for Indonesian coal supplies which have lower calorific value. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources noted that Indonesia's coal production since the beginning of 2025 reached approximately 390.2 million tons as of July 22, 2025, equivalent to approximately 53% of the 2025 target. Meanwhile, Indonesian coal exports reached approximately 199.2 million tons, only equivalent to approximately 40% of the 2025 target.",
