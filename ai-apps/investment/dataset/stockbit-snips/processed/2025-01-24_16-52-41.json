      "title": "Trump Opens Negotiations with China, Rupiah Strengthens to 16,173",
      "content": "The rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar strengthened by +0.66% to the level of 16,173 on Friday (24/1), marking the fifth consecutive day of gains and appreciating by a total of +1.17% WoW. Besides the rupiah, the currencies of several other emerging market countries also strengthened against the US dollar over the past week as of Friday (24/1), such as the Malaysian ringgit (+3.05% WoW), the Thai baht (+2.34% WoW), and the Philippine peso (+0.48% WoW).\n\nThe strengthening of the rupiah exchange rate was driven by the easing of trade war risks between the US and China after the US President, Donald Trump, said on Thursday (23/1) that he could reach a fair trade deal with China. Trump mentioned that he had a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week before he was officially inaugurated as the US president on January 20, 2025. Trump stated that the conversation went well and was friendly.\n\nTrump added that he preferred not to impose import tariffs on China. However, Trump emphasized that import tariffs are an extraordinary tool for the US to exert power over China.\n\nTrump's statement came a few days after he said he would impose a 10% import tariff on China effective February 1, 2025, on the grounds that the country had supplied narcotics to the US via Canada and Mexico. Upon inauguration, Trump implemented a 25% import tariff policy for Canada and Mexico for the same reason. This threat of import tariffs for China was softer compared to Trump's campaign promise where he claimed he would impose up to 60% import tariffs on China upon taking office.\n\nMarket Strategist at Krung Thai Bank, Poon Panichpibool, told Reuters that Asian currency rates would strengthen and the US 10-year government bond yield would tend to stabilize/decrease as long as market participants remain convinced that the Trump administration will not immediately implement tariff hikes and the tariff amounts will not be as severe as previously feared.",
