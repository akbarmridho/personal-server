      "content": "Multi-year growth story - We assess that DEWA offers significant growth potential in the coming years, with the company's EBITDA projected to grow from IDR 896 Million in 2024 to IDR 3.7 Trillion in 2028 (CAGR +43%). Meanwhile, we estimate DEWA's net profit will reach IDR 1.6 Trillion in 2028, up from the level of IDR 16 Million in 2024 (CAGR +216%). This growth will be driven by: 1) margin improvement in line with the business model transformation, shifting from reliance on subcontractors to being executed internally; and 2) potential for additional new contracts from affiliated groups. Business model transformation - DEWA is undergoing a business model transformation, which will reduce reliance on subcontractors and transition all existing contract work to be performed internally. We expect the internal work portion to gradually increase from the 52% level in 2024 to 100% in 2028. This transformation will boost the company's EBITDA margin from the 15% level in 2024 to 35% in 2028F, considering the significant margin difference if a project is executed through a subcontractor (~8%) compared to internally (~35%). Besides the upside from existing contracts, DEWA management also indicated the potential for additional contracts from affiliated groups, contingent upon the company proving it can deliver work effectively. We assume new contract additions from affiliates reach 50 million bcm in 2026, followed by additional additions of 25 million bcm each in 2027 and 2028. Increased capacity and capability as capital for transformation - The ample balance sheet post-financial restructuring through a debt-to-equity swap undertaken by DEWA in early 2025 opens access to funding from both banking and non-banking sources - including financing from vendors - which can be used to acquire heavy equipment for the company's projects. Furthermore, the joining of Teguh Boentoro (Salim affiliate) and Sorimuda Pulungan (former director of PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama or BUMA) to DEWA's board of directors demonstrates the company's commitment to executing the above transformation strategy. Current valuation already reflects 2026F net profit, but there is still potential upside by referencing BRMS - Despite rallying +66% since early 2025, we see DEWA's stock price still having potential upside by referencing BRMS - DEWA's sister company whose stock price is also trading at a premium around the estimated net profit for the next 2-3 years. With a price of IDR 184/share as of June 5, 2025, DEWA is trading at a valuation of 14.3x P/E 2025F and 7.1x P/E 2026F, more premium compared to United Tractors' ($UNTR) current valuation at 4.7x P/E 2025F. By considering the potential performance over the next 2-3 years, we see DEWA can trade at the level of Rp270/share or equivalent to 6.7x P/E 2028F. Although still higher than UNTR's 2025F P/E, we feel DEWA deserves to trade at a more premium valuation because the company focuses on the mining contractor segment, which is UNTR's best segment. Moreover, given that the growth over the next 2-3 years originates from internal initiatives and execution, we see the business risk from those growth sources tending to be small. The success of this business transformation is already beginning to show with DEWA's EBITDA and net profit growing by +62% QoQ and +901% QoQ in 1Q25.",

Currently, the company has 2 main clients, namely PT Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) and PT Arutmin Indonesia (AI), which are 2 of the largest mines owned by BUMI. Following management changes in June [2023](https://market.bisnis.com/read/20230614/192/1665504/sah-orang-kepercayaan-salim-duduki-direksi-darma-henwa-dewa) and [2024](https://emitennews.com/news/dewa-sepakat-berhentikan-djajen-sebagai-komisaris), and a [financial restructuring](https://www.idx.co.id/StaticData/NewsAndAnnouncement/ANNOUNCEMENTSTOCK/From_EREP/202503/38c85d4839_d500f9b4b9.pdf) in early 2025, we see the potential for DEWA's performance growth in the coming years (multi-year growth). This growth will be driven by 2 factors: 1) business model transformation, from previously relying on subcontractors to being executed entirely internally; and 2) potential for additional new contracts from affiliated groups. We project DEWA's net profit will grow from IDR 16 Million in 2024 to IDR 1.6 Trillion in 2028F, reflecting a CAGR growth of +216%. We also estimate the company's EBITDA will reach IDR 3.7 Trillion in 2028F, growing from IDR 896 Million in 2024 and reflecting a CAGR of +43%. This growth prospect can be achieved through improving the company's capacity and capability. From a capital aspect, the ample balance sheet after conducting a debt-to-equity swap allows DEWA to obtain funding - both from banking and vendor financing - to ensure the availability of heavy equipment to execute every project. Furthermore, the joining of Teguh Boentoro (Salim affiliate) and Sorimuda Pulungan (former director of PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama or BUMA) to DEWA's board of directors demonstrates the company's seriousness in executing the above transformation strategy.",

      "content": "DEWA is undergoing a business model transformation, from previously relying on subcontractors to executing projects entirely internally. This transformation has the potential to boost DEWA's margin going forward. Based on our analysis of the company's performance in 1Q25, DEWA booked an EBITDA margin of approximately ~35% for internally executed projects, about 4 times larger than the margin when using subcontractor services in the range of ~8%. We assess the EBITDA margin of 35% as a realistic figure to achieve, considering its level is equivalent to the EBITDA margin of UNTR's subsidiary, Pamapersada, at 34% during 2024. Pamapersada is the sector leader in the mining contracting business. To smooth this business transformation initiative, DEWA management at the end of 2024 decided to increase internal production capacity by 30 million bcm per year through a syndicated credit facility worth IDR 2.6 Trillion led by Bank Central Asia ($BBCA). Part of the equipment purchased using this facility - which is equivalent to the capacity for work of ~5.7 million bcm per year - was received by the company at the end of 2024, while the remainder is expected to arrive in early 2025. In 2025, DEWA will again increase its heavy equipment capacity equivalent to 30 million bcm per year, where the equipment is financed by vendors (vendor financing) and is expected to be received by the company in early 3Q25. Through this vendor financing scheme, DEWA's heavy equipment supplier vendor, XCMG China, provides deferred payment terms, so DEWA does not need to make a full payment and can pay in installments over the agreed tenor. Based on DEWA management's projection, when this business model transformation is fully running in 2027F, this initiative has the potential to increase DEWA's internal production capacity for AI and KPC from ~68 million bcm at the end of 2024 (46% of total operating capacity) to 147.6 million bcm at the end of 2027 (100% of total operating capacity).",

      "content": "Based on our discussion with DEWA management, the company indicated potential for new contracts from affiliated parties outside the BUMI group by the end of 2025. These contracts are expected to reach 50 million bcm per year and can be increased to 150 million bcm per year if DEWA successfully posts good performance. We see DEWA's expansion and contract growth trajectory running smoothly, considering the company's affiliation with a large Indonesian conglomerate and being in line with the trend of awarding contracts to affiliated entities to increase economic value within the group ecosystem. We expect that DEWA can still gain other contracts commensurate with its still substantial balance sheet capacity, as well as many new projects from related groups. Based on our analysis, several related entities that potentially add work for DEWA are: 1. Bumi Resources Minerals ($BRMS), a gold and copper company affiliated within the BUMI group. As of 2024, BRMS has total reserves of 5,054 koz of gold and 613 thousand tons of copper. 2. Ithaca Resources, a coal mining group affiliated with the CEO of BRMS and Vice Director of BUMI, Agoes Projosasmito. 3. Gayo Mineral Resources, a DEWA subsidiary engaged in gold mining. Based on information from DEWA management, Gayo Mineral Resources is expected to complete JORC in 2027. After completing JORC, DEWA potentially gains additional profit from the revaluation results of Gayo Mineral Resources. Furthermore, the operation of Gayo Mineral Resources has the potential to be additional work for DEWA. 4. Mach Metal Australia, a gold and copper mine owned by the Salim group in Australia.",

Additional volume of 50 million bcm from new contracts outside KPC and AI for 2026F, followed by contract additions of 25 million bcm each for 2027F and 2028F. 3.

      "content": "With the prospect of growth in the coming years, we estimate DEWA's fair value could reach Rp270/share (+47% upside from the price of Rp184/share as of June 5, 2025), based on the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation method. Our calculation considers sustainable company growth until 2028 (multi-year growth) followed by stable performance thereafter. At a price of Rp270/share, DEWA has a P/E valuation in 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 of 20.9x, 10.4x, 7.6x, and 6.7x, respectively. The price of Rp270/share also implies EV/EBITDA in 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 of 7.6x, 4.9x, 4x, and 3.6x, respectively. The calculation of DEWA's fair value depends on 2 main factors: 1) the speed of the progress in transitioning work from subcontractors to internal on existing contracts (KPC and AI); and 2) the addition of new work contracts outside existing contracts. In our base-case scenario which yields a fair value of Rp270/share, we estimate that the total proportion of internal work will increase to 69% in 2025, 87% in 2026, 98% in 2027, and 100% in 2028. This scenario also assumes additional work of 50 million bcm in 2026, increasing to 75 million bcm in 2027 and 100 million bcm in 2028. Beyond the base-case scenario, we also calculate the fair value of DEWA based on a more optimistic (bull-case) and more pessimistic (bear-case) scenario. The bull-case scenario results in a fair value of Rp300/share (+63% upside), while the bear-case scenario results in a fair value at the level of Rp160/share (-13% upside).",

      "content": "Besides calculating the fair value using conventional valuation methods, we assess that investors also need to consider the aspect of the owner or controller, which potentially influences how the market values DEWA. Using BRMS as a case study - whose stock price is also trading at a premium level - we assess that DEWA could continue to trade at a premium by considering the outlook for performance over the next 2-3 years. DEWA's stock price has rallied +66% YTD to the level of Rp184/share as of June 5, 2025, equivalent to 14.3x P/E 2025F and 7.1x P/E 2026F. This valuation is higher than UNTR's 2025F P/E at 4.7x. However, by taking into account the performance outlook for the next 2-3 years, we see DEWA's stock price potentially trading at the level of Rp270/share, equivalent to 6.7x P/E 2028F. Although still higher than UNTR's 2025F P/E, we see DEWA deserves to trade at a more premium valuation considering the company focuses on the mining contractor segment, which is UNTR's best segment. In addition, we assess that the business risk from DEWA's growth source tends to be small, given that the company's growth over the next 2-3 years comes from internal initiatives and execution. The success of this business transformation is already visible with the company's EBITDA and net profit in 1Q25 growing by +62% QoQ and +901% QoQ. We use BRMS as a case study to see DEWA's potential premium valuation, by considering the similarities between the two companies in terms of 1) controller, where both companies are sister companies under the BUMI group; 2) the existence of corporate actions; and 3) significant growth prospects post-corporate action. In 2021, BRMS conducted rights issues twice with total fund raised of approximately IDR 3.3 Trillion to finance expansion for the Palu gold mine project (PT Citra Palu Minerals or CPM) and the Gorontalo gold and copper mine (PT Gorontalo Minerals or GM). Although the contribution from BRMS's expansion only began to be significantly reflected in the financial performance in 2H23, the valuation of BRMS's enterprise value (EV) had started to increase since 2021. Its valuation corrected from its peak in May 2022, but remained at a relatively premium level until the end of 2022. Throughout 2023, BRMS's EBITDA gradually increased, but was no longer accompanied by a rise in valuation. The valuation increase resumed starting from 3Q24 along with the acceleration of EBITDA growth. The above dynamics can also be seen in the EV/EBITDA graph below, although the very small EBITDA figures in the 2021-2022 period caused the EV/EBITDA numbers to be highly volatile. In general, it can be concluded that BRMS's valuation increased first, reflecting expectations of performance growth in the coming years.",
