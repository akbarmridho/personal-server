      "content": "The significant increase in gold prices (+61% YTD) has boosted investor interest in IDX issuers operating in the gold industry. Issuers in the gold industry on the IDX themselves have diverse roles in the gold industry chain, as well as varying proportions of contribution from the gold business. This report aims to explain the gold industry process in Indonesia and related issuers, so that investors can understand the link between global gold price movements and the prospects and financial performance of each issuer. Difference in Business Model of Gold Issuers: Mining and Trading - Issuers in the gold industry can generally be divided into 2 business model categories, namely gold mining and gold trading. The gold mining business model focuses on the exploration and mining process of gold to produce gold ore and dore (gold bars with 10-30% gold content). Meanwhile, gold trading companies focus on refining and fabricating gold into final products such as minted bars and jewelry, which are then distributed and sold through retail stores. Generally, the profitability of gold mining companies tends to be influenced by the movement of gold prices, while the profitability of gold trading companies is more dependent on sales volume because their profits come from the buying and selling spread. Mapping of Issuers with Gold Business in Indonesia - Of all companies analyzed in this report, there are 11 issuers on the IDX that have gold mining concessions, with details: 2 companies CUAN and DEWA are currently exploring; 2 companies INDY and EMAS are in the gold mine facility construction phase; 3 companies BRMS, PSAB, and ARCI are pure-play gold miners; 3 companies MDKA, UNTR, and ANTM conduct gold business as one segment of their overall business operations; and 2 companies AMMN and PT Freeport Indonesia produce gold bullion from copper mines. In terms of production increase in 2026, EMAS will have the highest production growth from zero in 2025 to ~79 thousand oz of gold in 2026. Meanwhile, among the pure-play gold miners that are already operating, BRMS has the potential to record the highest production increase of +16% YoY in 2026. On the refining side, there are 3 companies ANTM, ARCI, and HRTA on the IDX that have dore gold refinery facilities into bullion, and 2 companies AMMN and PT Freeport Indonesia that operate Precious Metal Refinery (PMR) facilities which process anode slime from copper processing residue into gold bullion with 99.5-99.9% Au content.",

This price increase has also boosted investor interest in issuers operating in the gold industry. However, gold issuers on the IDX have different roles in the gold industry chain - from mining gold ore, refining, to the producers of finished goods such as gold bars and jewelry. Furthermore, the proportion of the gold business contribution to each company's financial performance also varies. Therefore, this report aims to explain the gold industry process in Indonesia comprehensively, while highlighting the position and role of issuers within it.

      "content": "In general, the gold industry business model is divided into 4 parts: 1. Exploration: the process of searching for gold ore reserves and assessing their economic feasibility for further processing. 2. Mining: the process of extracting ore gold using open pit or underground mining methods, which produces initial products in the form of dore (gold bars with 10-30% gold content) as well as other minerals such as silver, copper, and other base metals. 3. Refining: a processing operation to convert dore into bullion, high-purity gold bars (99.5-99.9%) officially recognized in the international market. 4. Fabrication: processing bullion into final products such as minted bars (small gold bars, generally 1-100 grams, which have been given serial numbers and certificates) or jewelry, which are then distributed and sold through retail stores to customers. In terms of characteristics, the gold mining business and gold trading business have model differences that can be summarized as follows: In addition to the production and sale of gold, there are supporting businesses such as gold pawn services, gold savings, and gold installment plans involving financial service companies such as PT Pegadaian and Bank Syariah Indonesia BRIS. Here are the details: 1. Gold pawn service: a loan/financing product that uses customer-owned gold as collateral to obtain cash. 2. Gold savings: a service for purchasing (can be resold) and depositing gold with financial service companies, where customers can earn profits from the increase in gold prices and/or returns in the form of gold (grams). 3. Gold installment plans: a financing scheme for purchasing gold with installments, where ownership of the gold transfers to the customer after all installments are paid off. Generally, in gold pawn and installment businesses, financial service companies earn revenue in the form of returns from the financing provided to customers. Meanwhile, in the gold savings business, financial service companies earn revenue from service fees (account opening, deposit) and the difference between buying and selling prices (spread). The gold industry cycle is repetitive, as consumers can sell minted bars or jewelry back to retail stores, which can then re-enter the refining stream to be processed into new bullion. Our report focuses on 12 issuers listed on the IDX that have exposure to the gold business model. Our report also includes PT Freeport Indonesia, considering its dominant role in the gold industry, both nationally and globally. Of these 13 companies, each has exposure to the business models as follows: The contribution of the gold business to each company's revenue is detailed as follows:",

      "title": "Sumber Emas: Tambang Emas vs. Tambang Tembaga",
      "content": "In nature, gold is generally found in relatively very low concentrations compared to other metal minerals such as copper (Cu) or nickel (Ni). The gold content in minerals is generally expressed in grams per ton (g/t), unlike other minerals expressed as a percentage (%) such as %Cu per ton or %Ni per ton, which indicates thousands of grams per ton. From an economic perspective, gold ore considered economic usually has a grade of 0.5-5 grams of gold per ton of rock (g/t Au). In Indonesia, the gold production process from mines is generally divided into 2, namely gold obtained from gold mines or gold obtained from copper mines. Simply put, the differences between the two are summarized as follows: Q: Why can copper mines in Indonesia produce gold? A: Copper ore in Indonesia is found in the porphyry copper-gold type, where copper ore contains gold and silver as associated metals. Therefore, gold obtained from copper mines is called a by-product, because it is obtained from the copper extraction process. This makes gold production economically viable even at relatively low grades. In terms of cost recording, most mining costs are charged to the main product, which is copper. Meanwhile, gold revenue is recorded as by-product credit, which serves to reduce the total operating cost of copper. As a result, the cash cost data for gold from copper mines is generally not available. Q: Why do gold mines in Indonesia not also produce copper? A: Gold ore in Indonesia is found in the epithermal gold deposits type, where the metal content is dominated by gold and silver along with other metals in small quantities, making it uneconomical to extract. Therefore, the copper contained in the ore is generally left in the mine tailings. After the exploration and resource classification stages, the next stage is identifying the characteristics of the gold ore that will determine the mining and processing methods used. In Indonesia, gold ore in nature is generally found in 2 main forms, namely oxide gold ore and sulfide gold ore. Oxide gold ore is usually found near the surface, while sulfide gold ore tends to be underground. The differences in the profiles of these two types of ore are summarized as follows: Of all the companies analyzed in this report, there are 12 companies that have gold mining concessions, with the following details: - 2 companies are currently exploring, namely Petrindo Jaya Kreasi (CUAN) through the Intam project and Darma Henwa (DEWA) through the Gayo Mineral Resources project. - 2 companies are in the gold mine facility construction phase, namely Indika Energy (INDY) through the Awak Mas project and Merdeka Gold Resources (EMAS) through the Pani project. - 6 companies already produce dore gold from gold mines, namely Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS), J Resources Asia Pasifik (PSAB), Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA), United Tractors (UNTR), Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN), Archi Indonesia (ARCI), and Aneka Tambang (ANTM). - 2 companies produce gold bullion from copper mines, namely Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN) and PT Freeport Indonesia. If grouped further, the 6 IDX issuers already producing dore are as follows: - 3 pure-play gold miners, namely Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS), J Resources Asia Pasifik (PSAB), and Archi Indonesia (ARCI). - 3 companies conduct gold business as one segment of their overall business operations, namely Merdeka Copper Gold (MDKA), United Tractors (UNTR), and Aneka Tambang (ANTM).

      "title": "FAQ Eksplorasi Emas",
      "content": "Q: How can a mine increase its reserves and resources? A: A mine's reserves generally increase due to higher commodity prices (more ore becomes economic because high cash cost ore can be processed), improvements in extraction technology (adopting new methods so that low-grade ore can be processed), and/or operational cost efficiencies (optimization of mine design and mining processes). Meanwhile, a mine's resources can increase if further exploration is conducted, either in areas around the active mine (brownfield) or in areas that have never been mined (greenfield). Q: How to calculate gold reserves/resources in kilo troy ounces? A: The formula to calculate gold reserves/resources in kilo troy ounces is as follows: Q: Will every open pit gold mine be followed by an underground mine? A: Not necessarily; the transition from open pit to underground mining is only carried out if geological, economic, and technical conditions support it. In Indonesia's case, the only open pit mine that has completed the transition operation to underground is PT Freeport Indonesia's Grasberg mine. Additionally, several companies are conducting studies/development of underground mines, including: 1. Merdeka Copper Gold's (MDKA) Tujuh Bukit Mine. 2. Bumi Resources Minerals' (BRMS) Citra Palu Minerals Mine. 3. Agincourt Resources' (UNTR's subsidiary) Martabe Mine.",

      "content": "After the reserves are proven to be economical, gold mine development continues with the submission of environmental permits (AMDAL) and the construction of mine facilities and supporting infrastructure which includes mine roads, processing plants, tailings storage, and office areas. The next stage is mining activities, carried out through open pit or underground mining methods, depending on the depth of the found gold ore. In open pit mines, gold ore near the surface is mined by stripping the overburden layer and taking the gold ore using heavy equipment such as excavators and dump trucks. Conversely, the underground mining method is applied to gold ore located beneath the surface using horizontal and vertical tunnel systems. Subsequently, gold ore obtained from gold mines is processed into semi-finished goods in the form of dore. This process includes crushing the ore into fine particles (crushing and grinding) and extraction using a chemical solution (leaching). In the leaching process, 2 commonly used methods are heap leach and carbon-in-leach (CIL), with the following differences: Of the 6 companies that already produce dore from gold mines, here is the capacity profile and technology of each mine: Q: Why is the unit for gold ore recorded in grams/ton while the dore output is recorded in troy ounces (oz)? A: The unit gram/ton is used by engineers on the ground as a reference for calculating volume and operational costs. In calculating production costs (cash cost), components such as fuel consumption, mining contractor services, and ore processing capacity are generally stated in per-ton units to ensure consistency and ease of cost analysis. Meanwhile, the troy ounce unit is used at the trading level because it is the international standard for gold prices in the global market (US$/oz). The use of the troy ounce unit in output facilitates the calculation of revenue received upon gold sale, where the selling price is determined using the global market gold price. Both can actually be converted using the formula: Q: When does a mine choose heap leach or carbon-in-leach processing? A: The selection between heap leach and carbon-in-leach processing depends on the gold grade in the ore. Heap leach is more suitable for ore with low gold grades (<1 g/t) due to its low cost. Its weakness lies in the lower extraction efficiency (recovery rate) with a longer production time (weekly to monthly). Meanwhile, the carbon-in-leach process is suitable for high-grade gold ore (>1 g/t) because although it requires higher costs, these costs will be offset by a higher gold yield due to better process efficiency and faster production time. In some cases, a gold mine may have both types of processing facilities to optimize results from various ore characteristics mined, such as at BRMS's Citra Palu Minerals mine.",

Estimated production in 2025F-2026F for each issuer is compiled based on company guidance and Stockbit analysis, considering several factors as follows: BRMS: commencement of heap leach facility operation at CPM targeted for completion in 3Q25. ARCI: production ramp-up following the recovery of the Araren pit. MDKA and EMAS: commencement of heap leach facility operation at the Pani project targeted for completion in 2026. UNTR: production ramp-up from the Sumbawa Jutaraya mine. INDY: commencement of the Awak Mas mine in 2026 with a full production target of 100 thousand oz per year. AMMN: production decrease in 2025 due to the transition from phase 7 to phase 8 at the Batu Hijau mine, where mining volume is dominated by overburden and low-grade ore, resulting in decreased output from the ore processed.

      "content": "The gold refining business processes gold alloy into pure gold bullion (99.9%). Characteristically, this business gains profit from processing services, resulting in relatively stable operating profit margins around 4-5% and is not significantly affected by global gold price volatility. The gold refinery process stages can be explained as follows: 1. Smelting process: raw materials, both dore and scrap originating from jewelry metal, are melted in a furnace to ensure the metal is homogeneously mixed into a slab form. 2. Purification process: the resulting slabs are then purified in 2 ways, namely the electrolysis process (slabs are dipped into an electrolyte solution and electricity is supplied so that gold and other metals separate) and/or the chemical dissolution process (slabs are mixed with aqua regia acid solution which can separate gold and other chemical compounds to obtain silver, copper, and other metals separately). 3. Casting process: pure gold (>=99.9%) obtained in flake/granule form is melted again and then poured into molds to form gold bars (bullion) with international standards, stamped with the purity level (99.99) and official serial number. 4. (Additional) minting process: pure gold (>=99.9%) obtained in flake/granule form is poured into molds to form thin sheets of various sizes (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 grams, up to 1 kg) or gold coins, then distributed to banks, jewelry stores, or directly to investors. As of October 2025, there are 3 issuers on the IDX that have facilities to refine dore gold into bullion, namely Aneka Tambang (ANTM), Archi Indonesia (ARCI), and Hartadinata Abadi (HRTA). Specifically for ANTM, the company's refinery is the only gold refinery plant in Indonesia accredited with the 'Good Delivery List Refiner' by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). This accreditation makes ANTM's refined gold recognized, trusted, and highly liquid in the global market, thus providing a stronger reputation, wider market access, and generally higher selling prices compared to non-LBMA refineries. Meanwhile, Amman Mineral Internasional (AMMN) and PT Freeport Indonesia operate refineries with a different technology, namely Precious Metal Refinery (PMR) which processes anode slime from copper processing residue.
