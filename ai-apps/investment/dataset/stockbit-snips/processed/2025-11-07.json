      "title": "Liquidity Injection Absorption Progress by State-Owned Banks",
      "content": "The Director General at the Ministry of Finance, Febrio Kacaribu, stated that state-owned banks conglomerate (Himbara) has distributed 167.6 trillion rupiah of liquidity injection funds from the government as of October 22, 2025, equivalent to approximately 84% of the total government placement funds. This realization increased by about +48% compared to the distribution value as of October 9, 2025, which reached 113 trillion rupiah (56% of placement). As a detail, Bank Mandiri (BMRI) and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) have distributed their entire government fund placements, amounting to 55 trillion rupiah each. Meanwhile, Bank Tabungan Negara (BBTN) remains the bank with the lowest distribution rate at 41%. Responding to this, BBTN President Director, Nixon Napitupulu, said during the 3Q25 earnings call that the remaining funds are targeted to be absorbed in November 2025. See the table above to compare the realization of Himbara credit distribution from government placement funds as of October 22, 2025, and October 9, 2025. BBRI explained that 51% of the government liquidity injection was allocated to the micro segment, while most of the funds received by Bank Syariah Indonesia (BRIS) were focused on the consumer segment. On the other hand, Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) and BMRI only stated that credit distribution was directed to the real sector, such as manufacturing, telecommunications, energy, and agriculture. Febrio added that there is additional fund demand from banks that have completed the distribution of government funds. He explained that the government will conduct an evaluation first, although he believes an additional 50-100 trillion rupiah is still rational as long as the funds are channeled into sectors with a large multiplier effect, such as MSMEs, food, green energy, and public housing.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway: Credit Growth and Banking Sector Outlook",
      "content": "Previously, the Ministry of Finance was optimistic that industry-wide credit growth could increase to the +10% YoY level by the end of 2025 - compared to the +7.56% YoY level before the liquidity injection announcement - aligning with the 2025 target which had been downgraded by Bank Indonesia to the range of +8-11% YoY. As of September 2025, an increase in money supply growth (M2) was already visible, as well as the acceleration of the industry-wide credit growth trend to the +7.7% YoY level. The release of this positive data can be a leading indicator for stronger economic growth in 4Q25, after slowing down in 3Q25. For the banking sector itself, the increase in liquidity has driven down the Cost of Funds (CoF) starting from September 2025, based on the 3Q25 earnings call presentations from the big banks. Generally, big bank management hopes that the decrease in CoF can offset the pressure on loan yield so that NIM can be maintained stable, alongside expectations of faster credit growth starting from 4Q25 and into 2026.",

      "title": "Bank Indonesia Latest Data and Policy Updates",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia recorded that the growth of adjusted primary money (M0) slowed down in October 2025 to +14.4% YoY to the level of 2,117.6 trillion rupiah (vs. September 2025: +18.6% YoY). This development was influenced by the growth of general bank deposits at adjusted Bank Indonesia amounting to +27.1% YoY and circulated currency amounting to +13.4% YoY. This adjusted M0 growth has considered the impact of liquidity incentives (adjusted monetary control). Bank Indonesia will release a new instrument named BI Floating Rate Note starting November 17, 2025, aimed at deepening the money market, especially developing the overnight index swap (OIS) market. This debt security has a tenor of 1-12 months and can be traded in the secondary market, including for non-resident investors. Additionally, Bank Indonesia will expand the underlying assets for repurchase agreements (repo) in its monetary operations beyond government debt securities and bonds to include other high-quality securities, including corporate bonds, SVBI, and commercial paper. Bank Indonesia will expand the underlying assets for repo starting November 10, 2025. Bank Indonesia recorded that Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves at the end of October 2025 increased to $149.9 billion (vs. September 2025: $148.7 billion), driven by government global bond issuance and tax and service receipts, amidst exchange rate stabilization policies. The foreign exchange reserve position at the end of October 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.2 months of imports or 6 months of imports and government foreign debt payments.",
