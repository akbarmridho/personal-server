      "title": "Poultry 2Q25: Pressured Broiler and DOC Prices",
      "content": "Japfa Comfeed Indonesia (JPFA), Charoen Pokphand Indonesia (CPIN), and Malindo Feedmill (MAIN) reported pressured performance during 2Q25 as broiler and DOC (day-old chick) prices fell sharply while demand has not recovered. JPFA was the best performer in the quarter, whereas CPIN and MAIN suffered significant corrections, even posting operating losses in some lines. This result is consistent with our previous outlook (https://stockbit.com/post/18469022) that the absence of the festive (Lebaran) season and the historical effect of the Suro month could depress poultry prices.\n\n1. JPFA: Net profit declined in 2Q25 (-18% QoQ, -32% YoY), resulting in a 1H25 decline of -16% YoY and below expectations (43%/40% of the 2025F Stockbit/Consensus estimate).\n2. CPIN: Net profit collapsed in 2Q25 (-76% QoQ, -66% YoY), making 1H25 growth +7% YoY and below expectations (42%/45% of the 2025F Stockbit/Consensus estimate).\n3. MAIN: Recorded its first quarterly loss since 1Q23 and a -91% YoY decline in net profit for 1H25.\n\nKey highlights of the three issuers' 2Q25 performance:\n\nBroiler segment: Only JPFA remained profitable. JPFA posted operating profit of IDR 292 billion in the Broiler segment in 2Q25 (+14% QoQ) even though the broiler price fell to IDR 16,326 per kg (-15% QoQ). CPIN, historically the strongest, recorded an operating loss of IDR 130 billion, while MAIN posted an operating loss of IDR 77 billion.\n\nDOC segment: Prices fell to IDR 4,196 per bird (-24% QoQ), causing all three issuers to record operating losses in this segment in 2Q25. JPFA was the most resilient with a loss of IDR 13 billion, followed by MAIN with a loss of IDR 45 billion, while CPIN suffered the deepest loss of IDR 197 billion.\n\nProcessed Chicken segment: The segment was also pressured. Although JPFA and MAIN showed year-over-year revenue growth in 2Q25, JPFA's operating profit fell to IDR 79 billion (-36% YoY) and MAIN returned to a loss of IDR 12 billion (vs. a loss of IDR 14 billion in 2Q24). CPIN saw revenue decline -17% QoQ and operating profit drop sharply to IDR 46 billion after having posted a profit of IDR 331 billion in 1Q25.\n\nKey Takeaway: With poultry prices still significantly unrecovered amid weak demand, we assess that accelerated government procurement is needed to boost demand and support a price recovery in 2H25. In the medium to long term, the implementation of a free nutritious meals program could structurally increase demand if it incorporates chicken products.\n\nSince the earnings releases of CPIN and JPFA on Thursday (31 July) afternoon, JPFA's share price rose +5.31% and CPIN fell -3.25% on Friday (1 August). MAIN, which released its results on Thursday (31 July) morning, saw its share price decline -8.8% by Friday (1 August). The outperformance of JPFA's share price can be attributed to its relatively more resilient performance compared with peers. MAIN will hold an earnings call on Friday (8 August) morning.",

      "content": "1. BPS reported that the consumer price index (CPI) inflation in Indonesia reached 2.37% year-on-year in July 2025 (vs. June 2025: 1.87% YoY), higher than the consensus expectation of 2.24% YoY and marking the highest annual inflation since June 2024. The expenditure groups driving inflation were 'food, beverages and tobacco' (3.75% YoY) and 'personal care and other services' (9% YoY), contributing 1.08 percentage points and 0.57 percentage points respectively. Monthly inflation was 0.3% MoM (vs. June 2025: 0.19% MoM). Core inflation in July 2025 eased to 2.32% YoY (vs. June 2025: 2.37% YoY), below the consensus expectation of 2.37% YoY.\n2. S&P Global reported that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 49.2 in July 2025 (vs. June 2025: 46.9), indicating a continued contraction in factory activity for the fourth consecutive month. Output decline slowed compared with the previous four months, but foreign demand returned to contraction after a brief stabilization in June 2025. Manufacturers remain optimistic about the next year, driven by expectations of economic improvement and lower raw material prices. However, optimism fell sharply compared with June 2025 and is the weakest since the PMI survey began in April 2012, amid concerns over US tariffs and weak consumer purchasing power. The July 2025 PMI survey was conducted between 10-24 July 2025, with almost all responses submitted before the announcement of the US-Indonesia trade agreement on 22 July 2025.\n3. S&P Global reported that China's manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5 in July 2025 (vs. June 2025: 50.4), below the consensus expectation of 50.2. The decline was driven by a second consecutive drop in production since October 2023, amid a continued contraction in new export orders for the fourth month, with a faster decline than in June 2025. Overall, producer optimism improved compared with June 2025, though still below historical averages.\n4. BPS reported that foreign tourist arrivals (wisman) to Indonesia reached approximately 1.4 million in June 2025 (+18.2% YoY, +8.4% MoM). This resulted in total foreign visitor arrivals of about 7.1 million in the first half of 2025, a +9.4% YoY increase, representing 44-50% of the 2025 government target of 14-16 million visitors.",

Quarterly revenue fell -2.2% QoQ, but net profit grew due to a reduction in cost of goods sold (-13.9% QoQ) and operating expenses (-16.4% QoQ), raising gross margin to 37.9% (vs. 29.5% in 1Q25) and operating margin to 33.9% (vs. 24.8% in 1Q25). The lower cost of goods sold was driven by inventory valuation changes, resulting in a lower average selling cost in 2Q25.
