      "title": "China Plans Fiscal Stimulus Without Key Details",
      "content": "Chinese Finance Minister Lan Fo'an seemed to be testing investor patience last Saturday (10/12) when he announced plans to release a fiscal stimulus package without major details. Analyst and investor consensus previously expected Lan to announce a fiscal stimulus value of 2 trillion yuan or 283 billion US dollars in a briefing last weekend. Bloomberg reported that details related to these stimuli would likely only be announced at the end of October 2024 after review by the National People's Congress. Although the value was not disclosed, Lan explained several fiscal stimulus plans that the Chinese government will release in the near future, including issuing more debt securities to help local governments, supporting the property sector, and increasing banking capital. Here are the details: The central government of China will issue more debt securities to ease debt pressure at the local government level. This is aimed at enabling local governments to focus more on helping their regional economies. Local governments can use funds obtained from their special bonds to purchase unsold houses and convert them into subsidized housing. Officials from the Chinese Ministry of Finance stated that there is significant room for the central government to increase debt and fiscal deficit. The largest State-Owned Banks in China will receive assistance to replenish their capital. This step was taken to relieve capital pressure after the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced a significant reduction in mortgage interest rates and cut its policy interest rate to revive the economy. Bloomberg reported that no new stimulus related to consumption incentives was conveyed by Lan in the briefing. Furthermore, Lan did not detail subsidies for households. Following this news, the stock market responded with mixed results, with the SSE Composite Index and CSI300 Real Estate Index closing higher at +2.07% and +3.94% respectively on Monday (10/14), while the Hang Seng Index weakened by -0.75%. On the same day, the yuan to US dollar exchange rate weakened by -0.18%. The announcement delivered by Lan came just one day before China's national statistics bureau announced that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in September 2024 was unchanged month-on-month and eased to 0.4% YoY (vs. August 2024: 0.4% MoM and 0.6% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation which predicted 0.4% MoM and 0.6% YoY inflation. Core inflation was unchanged month-on-month and eased to 0.1% YoY (vs. August 2024: 0.4% MoM and 0.3% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation which predicted 0.4% MoM inflation. China's annual core inflation in September 2024 was the lowest since February 2021. Key Takeaway: There are 2 potential implications of China's stimulus developments for Indonesia. From the financial market aspect, the attractiveness of the Chinese market in the eyes of foreign investors may decrease if the magnitude of the anticipated Chinese stimulus does not meet consensus expectations. This could reverse the outflow trend from several countries - including Indonesia - that has occurred recently. From an economic aspect, the success of the stimulus in aiding China's economic recovery has the potential to positively impact the exports of several Indonesian commodities, such as coal, CPO, copper, and nickel.",
