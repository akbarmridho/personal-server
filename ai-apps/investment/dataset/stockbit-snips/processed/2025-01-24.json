      "title": "Trump Opens Negotiations with China, Rupiah Strengthens to 16,173",
      "content": "The Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar strengthened by 0.66 percent to the level of 16,173 on Friday (24/1), marking a five-day rally and a week-over-week appreciation of 1.17 percent. In addition to the rupiah, several other emerging-market currencies also gained against the US dollar over the past week, including the Malaysian ringgit (+3.05% WoW), the Thai baht (+2.34% WoW), and the Philippine peso (+0.48% WoW). The rupiah's rise was driven by the easing of trade-war risk between the United States and China after US President Donald Trump said on Thursday (23/1) that he could reach a fair trade deal with China. Trump stated that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping the previous week before his own inauguration on 20 January 2025. He said the conversation went well and was friendly. Trump added that he preferred not to impose import tariffs on China, but emphasized that tariffs are a powerful tool for the United States to exert power over China. This statement came a few days after he announced a 10 percent import tariff on China effective 1 February 2025, citing that the country had supplied narcotics to the United States via Canada and Mexico. At his inauguration, Trump imposed a 25 percent import tariff on Canada and Mexico for the same reason. The proposed tariff on China is milder than his campaign promise of up to 60 percent. Market Strategist Poon Panichpibool of Krung Thai Bank told Reuters that Asian currencies are likely to strengthen and the yield on the US 10-year Treasury will remain stable or decline as long as markets believe the Trump administration will not quickly raise tariffs and that any tariff increase will be less severe than previously feared. Key Takeaway: Investors should closely monitor developments in US-China relations, as they could affect US inflation and interest-rate outlook, keeping markets volatile until more concrete news emerges. Conservative investors may consider short-term government bonds such as PBS003, which offers a 6.61 percent annual yield with a roughly two-year maturity. More risk-tolerant investors may look at big-bank stocks such as $BMRI and $BBCA.",

      "title": "Additional Market and Policy Updates",
      "content": "US President Donald Trump, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday (23/1), asked Saudi Arabia and OPEC to lower oil prices and urged a worldwide drop in interest rates. He warned global companies that they could face import tariffs if they produced goods outside the United States, without providing further details. Reuters reported that this statement reinforced the message that his second term would avoid free-market norms both domestically and internationally. Chairman of the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS), Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, told Antara News on Thursday (23/1) that the agency projects third-party funds (DPK) to grow by 6-7 percent year-over-year in 2025, expecting domestic economic recovery from mid-2Q25 as new government programs take effect and global conditions improve. LPS noted that DPK growth in 2024 was only 4.21 percent YoY, lower than its earlier 6 percent forecast. Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government has asked domestic liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters to postpone shipments this year as domestic energy demand rises, seeking to delay LNG exports until 2026 and to defer about 50 cargoes to balance increased consumption. In 2024, Indonesia exported roughly 300 LNG cargoes. The Bank of Japan decided on Friday (24/1) to raise its policy rate by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent, the highest since October 2008, in line with consensus expectations, as December 2024 inflation hit 3.6 percent YoY, above the BOJ's 2 percent target, and wages rose. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto issued a presidential instruction to cut the state budget by 306.7 trillion rupiah, comprising 256.1 trillion rupiah in ministry and agency spending efficiencies and a 50.6 trillion rupiah reduction in regional transfers, amounting to 8 percent of the 2025 APBN. The Finance Ministry spokesperson said the cuts do not require a budget revision. The instruction follows a week after the head of the National Nutrition Agency, Dadan Hindayana, said President Prabowo wants to accelerate free-lunch program distribution to 82.9 million beneficiaries this year, requiring an additional 100 trillion rupiah budget. Deputy Energy Minister Yuliot Tanjung said on Thursday (23/1) that the government aims to accelerate the development of nuclear power plants to 2029, three years earlier than the original 2032 target, aligning with the national electricity plan to reach 443 GW by 2060, with 79 percent from renewable energy. However, no private company has yet shown interest in investing in nuclear projects, which remain under government study.
