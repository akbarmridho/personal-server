      "content": "Bank Indonesia on Wednesday (17/9) cut the BI Rate by 25 bps to the level of 4.75%, outside of consensus expectations which projected no change. The lending facility was also cut by 25 bps to 5.5%, while the deposit facility was cut by 50 bps to 3.75%. With this decision, the BI Rate has fallen 125 bps since the beginning of 2025. \nGovernor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, stated that this decision is an effort to encourage economic growth, while maintaining the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate and inflation in the range of 1.5-3.5% in 2025 and 2026. Perry added that this BI Rate cut also considers the high probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at the meeting on Wednesday (17/9) local time, as well as the stable trend of the US Dollar Index (DXY) with a weakening tendency. Perry affirmed that his party welcomes the government's expansionary fiscal policy, including the placement of government cash reserves of 200 trillion rupiah in state-owned banks (Himbara), thus reflecting an all-out pro-growth stance from both state institutions.",

      "title": "Discussion on Expanding Bank Indonesia's Mandate and DPR's Authority in Governor Dismissal related to the BI Rate Cut",
      "content": "This BI Rate cut occurs amidst discussions in the DPR regarding adding Bank Indonesia's mandate and granting authority to the DPR to recommend the dismissal of the Bank Indonesia Governor, which is stipulated in the draft of the Bill on Financial Sector Development and Strengthening (P2SK) amendments. Kontan noted that the discussion on expanding the mandate includes \"creating a conducive economic environment for real sector growth and job creation.\" Currently, BI's mandate is limited to stabilizing the Rupiah exchange rate, maintaining payment system stability, and supporting sustainable economic growth within the framework of maintaining financial system stability. The discussion on a new provision where the DPR has the authority to recommend the dismissal of Bank Indonesia's board of governors may increase concerns about Bank Indonesia's independence, according to a Bloomberg report. These concerns were highlighted again after Bank Indonesia and the government signed a new burden-sharing agreement.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway on BI Rate Decision",
      "content": "We assess that Bank Indonesia's decision to cut interest rates again reinforces the signal that priority is given to economic growth recovery, following the announcement of the 3rd stimulus package for 2025 and the government's liquidity injection policy to Himbara. We also highlight that the cut in the deposit facility rate was larger than the BI Rate cut. The deposit facility rate itself is the overnight interest rate paid by Bank Indonesia on surplus funds placed by commercial banks, where this rate influences the overnight interbank loan rate. We assess that a larger cut in the deposit facility rate compared to the BI Rate is expected to increase the incentive for commercial banks to channel surplus funds as credit, rather than placing funds with other banks/Bank Indonesia. This initiative is taken considering the slow ongoing transmission of the BI Rate cut, where Bank Indonesia records that lending rates and 1-month deposit rates for banking have only decreased by -7 bps and -16 bps respectively from the beginning of the year up to August 2025.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia noted that banking credit growth reached +7.56% YoY as of 8M25 (vs 7M25: +7.03% YoY, 8M24: +11.4% YoY), lower than the 2025 target which has been downgraded by Bank Indonesia to the range of +8-11% YoY. Based on use, investment credit grew +13.86% YoY during 8M25 (vs 7M25: +12.42% YoY), while consumption credit was +7.89% YoY (vs 7M25: +8.11% YoY) and working capital was +3.53% YoY (vs 7M25: +3.08% YoY). On the funding side, Third Party Funds as of 8M25 grew +8.51% YoY (vs 7M25: +7% YoY), with a Loan-to-Deposit Ratio of 86.03 percent. \nPresident Prabowo Subianto conducted another reshuffle of the \"Merah Putih\" Cabinet on Wednesday (17/9), including shifting Erick Thohir's position from Minister of State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) to Minister of Youth and Sports and appointing Djamari Chaniago as Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. The State Secretary, Prasetyo Hadi, stated that the government has not yet appointed a definitive replacement for the new Minister of BUMN position. \nNational Nutrition Agency stated on Tuesday (16/9) that the government plans to expand the Free Nutritious Food program to teachers and posyandu volunteers. Currently, the program only targets recipients who are children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding mothers. \nUS Census Bureau noted that US retail sales in August grew +0.6% MoM (vs July: +0.6% MoM), exceeding consensus expectations which projected +0.2% MoM. Annually, US retail sales grew +5% YoY in August 2025 (vs July 2025: +4.1% YoY). Reuters reported that although US retail sales strengthened, economists still expect the Fed to cut interest rates at the meeting on Wednesday (17/9) local time due to the weakening US labor market. \nThe Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, told Reuters on Wednesday (17/9) that the free trade agreement with the European Union (IEU-CEPA) will be signed in Bali on September 23, 2025. Airlangga's statement came after the Financial Times reported on Tuesday (16/9) that European Union Trade Commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, would visit Indonesia to sign the agreement. Previously, Airlangga stated in June 2025 that the agreement would allow Indonesia to obtain zero tariffs for nearly 80% of its exported products to the European Union along with the removal of non-tariff barriers. The government also hopes that the European Union can accelerate the ratification process after the signing, so the agreement can take effect at the end of 2026 or 2027.",
