      "title": "DXY Continues Weakening Amid Fed Chair Dismissal Issue",
      "content": "The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) fell 1.8% week-over-week to 98.36 on Tuesday, 22 April, after briefly dropping to 97.93 on Monday, marking the lowest level since March 2022. Since the start of the year, the DXY has weakened 9.3% YTD to date. The weakening occurred as investors exited the United States amid escalating trade wars and concerns over a U.S. recession, and was further aggravated by worries about reduced Federal Reserve independence as President Donald Trump explores ways to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell because of disagreements over U.S. interest-rate policy.\n\nIn November 2024, Powell asserted he would not step down until his term ends in May 2026, also stating that any Trump-initiated removal would be prohibited by regulations.\n\nAmid the DXY weakness, gold continued its upward trend, reaching an all-time-high of $3,499 per troy ounce in intraday spot trading today. On Monday, 21 April, spot gold closed up 3.28% at $3,423 per ounce, up 28.8% YTD. Additionally, investors appear to be shifting funds to other developed-market currencies, reflected in a 12.1% YTD rise in the yen, an 11% YTD rise in the euro, and a 6.8% YTD rise in the pound.\n\nConversely, the Indonesian rupiah weakened 4.7% YTD to 16,855 per dollar today, though it slightly recovered from its all-time low of 16,957 on 9 April 2025. The rupiah’s depreciation since the start of the year makes it one of the worst-performing emerging-market currencies amid the DXY slide, driven largely by fragile investor confidence in Indonesia. According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, MUFG Bank projects the rupiah will further weaken to around 17,100 per dollar in the coming months, while Barclays forecasts a level of 17,200 by 1Q 2026 assuming Bank Indonesia intervention.\n\nKey Takeaway: The shift to gold is expected to continue. In mid-April 2025, Goldman Sachs raised its 2025 year-end gold price target to $3,700 per ounce, driven by heightened concerns over the U.S. economy amid the trade war with China.\n\nRegarding the rupiah, its continued weakness could limit Bank Indonesia’s ability to cut rates. Reuters reported that economists expect Bank Indonesia to keep the BI Rate at 5.75% at the Board of Governors meeting on 23 April, due to concerns that a weaker rupiah would offset slowing growth. The same Reuters poll expects a 25-basis-point cut to 5.5% in 2Q 2025 and a further 25-basis-point cut to 5.25% in 3Q 2025, where it would stay through the end of 2025.",

      "content": "1. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China is willing to import more Indonesian products, describing the two countries as “defenders of globalisation and free trade.” In response, Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono said the partnership with China and the United States is equally important for Indonesia.\n2. China’s customs authority recorded a 9% year-on-year decline in Indonesian coal imports in March 2025 to about 18 million tonnes. The drop came after Indonesia mandated the Coal Price Benchmark (HBA) as the reference price for coal exports as of 1 March 2025, although the government gave a relaxation allowing exporters to continue using the Indonesian Coal Index for existing contracts.\n3. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Regulation No. 10/2025 outlining a roadmap for the power-sector energy transition, banning new coal-fired power plants and limiting existing plants to operate no later than 2050. PLN’s EVP Zainal Arifin said renewable energy – nuclear and geothermal – will replace coal.\n4. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office flagged Indonesian customs practices as a non-tariff barrier, citing inconsistent valuation, uneven customs assessment and the risk of abuse of customs officers’ discretion. Center of Economics and Law Studies CEO Bhima Yudhistira told Kontan the issue has long been raised by foreign and domestic firms and should prompt reform.\n5. Kontan reported that live-chicken prices have plunged sharply in the weeks after Lebaran 2025 to about IDR 11,500-12,000 per kilogram, far below the government-set purchase price of IDR 21,000-23,000 per kilogram. GPI Secretary-General Samhadi said the drop is mainly due to oversupply from the free-meal program and weakened consumer purchasing power.\n6. AISI’s Commercial Director Sigit Kumala said the association is considering cutting the 2025 domestic motorcycle sales target, after 1Q 2025 sales fell 3% YoY to roughly 1.7 million units (25-27% of the 6.4-6.7 million target). He added that weaker consumer purchasing power and tighter financing have pressured sales, and no clear catalyst is seen for the remainder of the year.",
