      "title": "ASII 1Q24: Resilient Performance Thanks to Diversification; Approves Final Dividend of Rp421 per Share",
      "content": "Astra International (ASII) reported net profit of 7.5 trillion rupiah, down 14.4% year-on-year and 8.4% quarter-on-quarter in 1Q24, equal to 24.1% of the FY24 consensus estimate. Although below expectations, the low net profit was also caused by a decline in the investment value of Medikaloka Hermina (HEAL) and GoTo Gojek Tokopedia (GOTO). Excluding the decline in investment values, ASII's net profit for 1Q24 would have been a resilient 8.1 trillion rupiah, equal to 26.3% of the FY24 consensus and in line with expectations.\n\nBy segment, Automotive and United Tractors (UNTR) weighed on ASII's performance, while Financial Services were the main support. Details:\n\nAutomotive – operating profit fell 45.8% YoY, though it improved quarter-on-quarter. The decline was due to higher selling expenses (+4.7% YoY) and higher general and administrative expenses (+8.3% YoY), while revenue remained relatively stable (+0% YoY, +17.6% QoQ). Management explained that maintaining revenue despite a 20% YoY drop in vehicle sales volume was achieved by selling higher-priced models such as Innova Zennix and Yaris Cross.\n\nUnited Tractors (UNTR) – operating profit fell 8.5% YoY and 22.6% QoQ, driven by weakness in heavy equipment and coal mining sales. However, the mining contractor segment recorded good performance and supported UNTR's results (https://stockbit.com/post/14585749).\n\nFinancial Services – operating profit grew 19.1% YoY and 5.0% QoQ, driven by strong consumer financing in automotive, motorcycle and heavy equipment segments.\n\nIn addition to Financial Services, ASII's performance was supported by solid results from associated entities and joint ventures. Net profit of associated entities and JVs grew to 2.6 trillion rupiah (+5.2% YoY, +16.0% QoQ), supported by a higher profit of PT Astra Honda Motor of 2.4 trillion rupiah (+4.0% YoY).\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nWe assess ASII's 1Q24 performance as fairly good. Amid a slowdown in automotive sales (https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/news/20240325140713-4-525188/penjualan-motor-mobil-anjlok-tanda-kantong-orang-ri-seret), ASII's net profit excluding investment value declines fell only 5% YoY. Positive performance from Financial Services, Mining Contractor (under UNTR), and associated entities and JVs helped offset weaknesses, showing stability due to diversification.\n\nWe also consider that various bad news has already been reflected in ASII's share price, limiting further downside risk. With a low valuation (7x 1-Year Forward P/E), ASII offers an attractive risk-reward profile.\n\nAt the shareholders meeting on Tuesday (30/4), ASII shareholders approved a final dividend of 421 rupiah per share, indicating a final dividend yield of 8.2%.",
