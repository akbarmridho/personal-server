      "title": "Oil Prices Strengthen Due to Iran Explosion and Libya Protests",
      "content": "Crude Brent spot price has risen by 4.2% since the close on Tuesday (2/1) to USD 79.35 per barrel. Two main catalysts drove the price increase in the past two days: (1) Explosion in Iran – on Wednesday (3/1) two explosions occurred near the burial site of an Iranian military commander, killing at least 103 people. No group has claimed responsibility; Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi blamed Israel. (2) Closure of Libya's largest oil field – the Sharara Oil Field, producing 300,000 barrels per day, was shut on Wednesday (3/1) by local protesters over high fuel prices and lack of economic opportunities. The escalation of geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran, together with the shutdown of Libya's biggest oil field, raised concerns about a disruption in global crude oil supply. As of November 2023, Iran was the world's 8th largest crude producer with 3.12 million barrels per day (~3% of global output). Libya ranked 19th with 1.2 million barrels per day. The loss of 300,000 barrels per day from Libya could reduce global crude supply by about 0.3%. In response to higher oil prices, oil‑related issuers appreciated on Thursday (4/1): MEDC (+2.61%), ENRG (+2.5%), ELSA (+3.55%), WINS (+3.96%), LEAD (+2.99%). Potential supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions may support oil prices amid weak demand expectations due to a projected slowdown in global economic growth. However, if China's economy does not weaken as much as expected, it could bolster global growth.",
