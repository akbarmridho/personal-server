      "content": "Gaikindo noted that car wholesales in July 2025 only reached 60,552 units. Although increasing by +5% MoM, this figure is still down -18% YoY, not much different from the annual decline in the last 2 months (May 2025: -15% YoY, June 2025: -23% YoY). For context, wholesales in July 2025 coincided with the GIIAS 2025 exhibition held from July 24 to August 3, 2025 (GIIAS 2024: July 18-24, 2024). This result brings wholesales for 7M25 to 435,390 units (-10% YoY), equivalent to only 48-58% of Gaikindo's 2025 target range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 7M24: 56% realization for 2024). The monthly increase in industry sales is generally driven by Japanese brands, although yearly sales figures are still declining. Among Japanese brands, only Suzuki (+11% YoY, +22% MoM) posted positive annual sales growth in July 2025, driven by sales of the Fronx. For Astra International (ASII), Toyota sales were recorded at 18,905 units (-30% YoY, +6% MoM), while Daihatsu was 10,451 units (-25% YoY, +12% MoM). Combined, these two main ASII brands booked annual decline (-28% YoY, +8% MoM) and were worse than the industry realization (-18% YoY, +5% MoM). Meanwhile, we highlight the sales of Chinese brands - such as Chery and BYD+Denza - which show weakening momentum with a monthly sales decline, although they are still growing annually. Among Chinese brands, only Wuling experienced a monthly sales increase in July 2025, although this was more due to the low-base effect.",

      "content": "We assess that the price war - reflected in the launch of the BYD Atto 1 priced at ~200 million rupiah - is causing consumers to adopt a wait and see approach, potentially impacting car sales, especially in the electric vehicle segment dominated by Chinese brands. In the 2Q25 earnings call, ASII management stated that intensified competition along with the price war from Chinese brands could put pressure on ASII's margins, particularly in the greater Jakarta area which is most affected by this competition. However, given the market's already low expectations for automotive sales, we assess that ASII's stock performance could also be affected by the developments of the strategic review currently being undertaken by the company.",

In June 2025, retail sales were recorded at +1.3% YoY and -0.2% MoM (vs. May 2025: +1.9% YoY, -1.3% MoM), lower than Bank Indonesia's expectation which anticipated growth of +2% YoY and +0.5% MoM. China's national statistics bureau noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in China was flat on an annual basis in July 2025 (vs. June 2025: 0.1% YoY inflation), exceeding consensus expectations which predicted deflation of 0.1% YoY. Monthly, inflation reached 0.4% MoM (vs. June 2025: -0.1% MoM deflation), exceeding consensus expectations at 0.3% MoM. Core inflation reached 0.8% YoY (vs. June 2025: 0.7% YoY inflation), marking the highest level in the last 17 months.",

The Director General at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi, on Monday (11/8) reaffirmed that the government plans to implement the B50 biodiesel mandate in 2026, although it is highly unlikely to start in January 2026. Furthermore, it is not yet known when the trial for this policy will begin. The Indonesian Biofuel Producers Association estimates that the B50 biodiesel mandate will likely require up to 19 million kiloliters of palm oil fuel per year. For comparison, the government has allocated 15.6 million kiloliters of palm oil fuel this year for the B40 program, an increase from the 13.2 million kiloliters allocated for the B35 program in 2024.",
