      "title": "DPR Proposes Lower Increase in Cigarette Excise and Gradual Increase in Sweetened Beverage Tax",
      "content": "The House of Representatives (DPR) recommended that the excise duty rate on tobacco products (CHT) for machine-made white cigarettes (SPM) and machine-made kretek cigarettes (SKM) be increased by a minimum of 5 percent per year in 2025 and 2026. This proposal is lower than the average CHT increase of 10 percent in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, the DPR suggested a limited increase for hand-rolled kretek cigarettes (SKT) in 2025 and 2026, considering labor absorption.\n\nIn addition to CHT, the DPR also proposed a minimum excise tax on sweetened beverages in packaging (MBDK) of 2.5 percent in 2025, to be gradually raised until it reaches 20 percent. This proposal differs from the earlier draft, which considered a MBDK excise of 1,771 rupiah per liter, in line with the average MBDK excise rates in Southeast Asian countries.\n\nThe latest MBDK excise discussion does not specify the product criteria that will be taxed. However, the previous draft defined taxable MBDK products as: 1) MBDK without added sweeteners but containing more than 6 grams of sugar per 100 milliliters, and 2) MBDK containing any natural or artificial sweeteners in any amount.\n\nThe proposed CHT and MBDK rates remain recommendations; the final decision rests with the Minister of Finance in the new cabinet. The government has set a target excise revenue of 244.2 trillion rupiah in the 2025 state budget, a 5.93 percent increase compared with the 2024 outlook of 230.5 trillion rupiah.\n\nKey takeaway: The lower projected CHT increase could provide relief for the cigarette industry, which has been burdened by continuously high excise hikes in recent years.",
