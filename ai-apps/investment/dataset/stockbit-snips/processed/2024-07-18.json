      "content": "President Joko Widodo officially appointed Thomas Djiwandono, the nephew of Prabowo Subianto and treasurer of the Gerindra Party, as Deputy Finance Minister on Thursday (18 July). Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, head of the Prabowo-Gibran Synchronisation Task Force, told Reuters that the appointment is intended to smooth the transition from the administration of President Jokowi to President-elect Prabowo. According to a report by Harian Kompas, Thomas began his career as a trainee reporter at Tempo magazine in 1993 and at Indonesia Business Weekly in 1994. He later worked as a financial analyst at Whetlock NatWest Securities in Hong Kong and helped his uncle, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, manage the Arsari Group as Deputy CEO. Thomas graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in International Relations and International Economics. He was rumored to be considered for the next Finance Minister position after joining the Prabowo-Gibran task force on economics and finance. In comments to Reuters, Thomas said he will not become Finance Minister in the Prabowo-Gibran administration and that Prabowo is still considering professional candidates for the role. In February 2024, Bloomberg reported that Prabowo was weighing several former bankers as possible Finance Minister candidates, including the Director General of the Financial Services Authority Mahendra Siregar and the President Director of Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) Royke Tumilaar. In April 2024, Reuters also reported that former Finance Minister Chatib Basri was among the candidates considered by Prabowo.",
