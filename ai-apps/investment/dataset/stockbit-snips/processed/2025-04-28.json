      "title": "BBNI reports net profit of 5.4 trillion rupiah in 1Q25, up 1% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) recorded a net profit of 5.4 trillion rupiah in the first quarter of 2025, representing a 1% year-over-year increase and a 4.4% quarter-over-quarter increase, roughly in line with the consensus estimate of 23% of the 2025 forecast. Asset quality remained stable. Net interest income grew 4.7% YoY to 9.8 trillion rupiah, but the bank-only loan yield fell to 7.4% (down from 7.5% in 1Q24 and 7.9% in 4Q24) due to heightened competition, causing interest income to rise only 5.3% YoY despite a 10% YoY credit growth. Interest expense rose 6.1% YoY as the bank prioritized securing funding amid tight liquidity, pushing the bank-only cost of fund (CoF) to 2.8% (unchanged from 1Q24, up from 2.7% in 4Q24). Consequently, the net interest margin (NIM) slipped to 3.9% in 1Q25 (down from 4.0% in 1Q24 and 4.5% in 4Q24), below the management’s 2025 guidance range of 4.0%-4.2%. The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) fell to 93% from 96% in December 2024, aligning with the 2025 target of staying below 95%. Management noted that liquidity improvement remains uncertain while the rupiah stays under pressure, despite a significant maturity of SRBI in the near term. Pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) grew only 1.6% YoY due to weak non-interest income, which fell 0.5% YoY, as fee income grew modestly 2.6% YoY and recovery income dropped 7.5% YoY. Credit cost (CoC) stood at 0.9% in 1Q25 (down from 1.0% in 1Q24 and 1.5% in 4Q24), slightly below the 2025 guidance of around 1% because of reversals on several corporate clients. Management kept the 2025 CoC guidance at about 1%. Non-performing loans (NPL) and loan-at-risk (LAR) remained stable at 2% and 10.9% respectively, unchanged from the end of 2024. Direct exposure to U.S. export clients accounted for about 3% of total credit. With stricter loan underwriting and adequate provisioning, management is optimistic that any change in the 2025 CoC guidance would not materially affect results. Overall, we remain neutral on BBNI’s 1Q25 performance. Management maintains its 2025 guidance but may revise it after the 2Q25 results.",
