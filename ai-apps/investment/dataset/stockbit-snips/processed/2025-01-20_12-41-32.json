      "title": "Acquisition Plans: TOWR-DATA; BBTN-Bank Victoria Syariah",
      "content": "There are 2 planned acquisition actions announced today, Monday (20/1). First, Sarana Menara Nusantara ($TOWR) through its business entity, PT Iforte Solusi Infotek (Iforte), plans to acquire ~40% of shares in Remala Abadi ($DATA). Second, Bank Tabungan Negara ($BBTN) plans to acquire 100% of PT Bank Victoria Syariah shares. Some details regarding these two acquisitions are as follows: \n- TOWR Acquires DATA \n  TOWR through its business entity, Iforte, announced a plan to acquire ~40% of DATA shares from Verah Wahyudi Singgih Wong and Jimmi Anka. The total transaction value has not been announced. The share purchase agreement was signed on December 23, 2024. The objective of this acquisition is for business development and strengthening the group's position in the telecommunications infrastructure sector. After this transaction, TOWR through Iforte will become the new controller of DATA, leading to a mandatory tender offer.\n- BBTN Acquires PT Bank Victoria Syariah \n  BBTN announced plans to acquire 100% of PT Bank Victoria Syariah shares as part of the spin-off of the company's Sharia business unit, BTN Syariah. The acquisition value has not been announced, while the financing will use BBTN's internal funding sources. The acquisition is expected to be completed in May 2025, with BBTN's General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPS) planned for March 14, 2025. PT Bank Victoria Syariah itself is an entity directly owned approximately 80.2% by Victoria Investama ($VICO) and approximately 19.8% by Bank Victoria International ($BVIC). Furthermore, VICO owns approximately 44.2% of BVIC shares, resulting in VICO's total direct and indirect ownership in PT Bank Victoria Syariah amounting to approximately 89%.\n\nAt the closing of the market today, all five stocks closed higher, with DATA +25%, TOWR +0.76%, BBTN +0.92%, VICO +8.55%, and BVIC +19.35%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nBBTN's acquisition of PT Bank Victoria Syariah aligns with our forecast written in Stockbit Commentary in July 2024. We assess that the impact and subsequent sentiment from both acquisitions will depend on the announcement of the acquisition value, whether it is done at an expensive or cheap valuation. We assess that the stocks that will be more affected by the short-term sentiment are DATA, which will be acquired by TOWR, and VICO as the controller of PT Bank Victoria Syariah.\n\n*This article was previously released on Monday (20/1) morning in Stockbit Commentary TOWR and BBTN.",

Nevertheless, Bahlil mentioned that the government wants to maintain a balance between demand relative to the work plan and budget (RKAB) and industry capacity to maintain nickel prices. Bahlil gave an example: if a company applies for nickel production of 20 million tons, the government will only issue a permit for 60% of that amount, with the remaining 40% having to be absorbed from local businesses. Previously, Bloomberg reported in December 2024 that the Indonesian government was considering cutting the nickel ore production quota from 272 million tons in 2024 to 150 million tons in 2025.",

The Ministry of Trade also stated that the European Union will be forced to adjust its policies to comply with the WTO ruling, adding that the Indonesian government will closely monitor changes in EU regulations to meet the WTO recommendations. This dispute originated when Indonesia sued the European Union in 2019, following the EU's decision that palm oil-based diesel would not be considered biofuel due to its connection with deforestation, and its use as a transportation fuel would be phased out between 2023-2030. Although the WTO deemed the logic underlying the EU's measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions as legitimate, they found flaws in the way the EU prepared, issued, and implemented its actions.",
