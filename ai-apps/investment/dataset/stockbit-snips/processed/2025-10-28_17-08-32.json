      "content": "The government officially released Government Regulation No. 38/2025 which allows the central government to provide loans to local governments, State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN), and Regional-Owned Enterprises (BUMD) to support national development projects. This policy aims to provide cheaper financing for infrastructure projects and development programs at the provincial and regency levels. These loans will be financed from the State Budget (APBN) and must receive approval from the DPR (House of Representatives), and will only be given to borrowers in sound financial condition. The central government will also impose a fine for late payments, which will be determined according to the agreement with the borrower. The regulation emerged after President Prabowo Subianto cut the budget transfer to the regions in 2026 by -20% YoY to 693 trillion rupiah to make room for priority programs such as Free Nutritious Meals and increased defense spending.",

      "content": "Bank Mandiri (BMRI) recorded a net profit of 13.3 trillion rupiah in 3Q25 (-14% YoY, +18% QoQ). This result brings the net profit for 9M25 to 37.7 trillion rupiah (-10% YoY), in line with expectations as it equals 75% of the consensus 2025F estimate (vs. 9M24: 75% realization for 2024). In general, the performance in 3Q25 had a trend consistent with the 9M25 performance, where annual net profit declined due to: 1) Weak Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) due to an opex surge amidst Net Interest Income (NII) growing only in the low-single digits; and 2) an increase in provision expenses of +22%/+10% YoY in 3Q25/9M25. BMRI management maintained the 2025 guidance for loan growth, Net Interest Margin (NIM), and Cost of Credit (CoC). For 2026, management indicated potentially higher loan growth and aims to maintain NIM levels in an era of lower interest rates. - PPOP Decreased Due to Opex Surge Amidst Sluggish NII Growth Consistent with management guidance given in the 1H25 earnings call, opex still rose significantly in 3Q25 (+25% YoY), thus pressing PPOP down -9% YoY in 3Q25 and -7% YoY over 9M25. Management maintained guidance that the opex increase during 2025 will remain around +25% and will normalize (flat on an annual basis) in 2026. The rise in opex occurred amidst NII growing only +1%/+5% YoY in 3Q25/9M25 following pressure on the Cost of Fund (CoF). The decrease in CoF from government liquidity injection was only reflected in September 2025, where MTD CoF dropped to 2.33% (vs. 1H25: 2.46%; 9M25: 2.43%). Non-Interest Income (Non-II, including net insurance income) remained relatively solid, growing +8%/+5% YoY in 3Q25/9M25. - Asset Quality Maintained, CoC Below Guidance NPL and LAR decreased as of September 2025 (vs. June 2025) to 1.19% and 6.48% respectively. Provision expense increased +22% YoY in 3Q25 but only rose +10% YoY over 9M25, resulting in a CoC over 9M25 recorded at 0.7% and below the 2025 guidance (0.8-1%). With expectations of maintained asset quality (stable LAR and NPL) in 4Q25, the CoC position at year-end has the potential to be lower than the 2025 guidance. - Indication for 2026: Higher Loan Growth, Lower Loan Yield vs. CoF Dynamic BMRI management has not provided official guidance for 2026 but indicated that credit growth has the potential to be higher next year (vs. 2025 guidance: +8-10% YoY) following macroeconomic improvement driven by government spending and the trend of falling interest rates. Challenges are more visible on the margin side, according to BMRI management, where loan yield may face pressure due to liquidity easing increasing competition. Amid loan yield pressure, BMRI hopes to maintain NIM at a relatively stable level through CoF reduction.",

In 3Q25, cost of revenue rose +13% YoY/+11% QoQ, while opex rose +13% YoY/+9% QoQ. The increase in cost of revenue and opex in 3Q25 was mainly driven by increased depreciation costs, supporting costs, and selling costs. Meanwhile, revenue in 3Q25 only rose by +8% YoY/+6% QoQ along with weakening revenue from non-taxi segments (+2% YoY/+2% QoQ).
