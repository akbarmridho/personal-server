      "title": "OECD Cuts Indonesia Economic Growth Outlook Again",
      "content": "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has again reduced its projection for Indonesia's economic growth to 4.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) in 2025 and 4.8 percent YoY in 2026 in the outlook released in early June 2025, each lower by 0.2 percentage points compared with the March 2025 outlook. This marks the second downgrade of the Indonesia outlook by the OECD this year, following the March 2025 revision. In addition to Indonesia's growth outlook, the OECD also lowered its global economic growth projection to 2.9 percent YoY in both 2025 and 2026, each lower by 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points respectively compared with the March 2025 outlook. This second global outlook downgrade follows the March 2025 revision and is driven by significant slowdown risks in several advanced economies – such as the United States, Canada and Mexico – as trade barriers rise and geopolitical uncertainty increases. While the weakening of global growth adds extra pressure on emerging markets, the OECD emphasised that the downgrade of Indonesia's growth outlook is mainly caused by domestic factors, not by the direct impact of U.S. import tariffs. The OECD noted that Indonesia's exports to the United States account for less than 2 percent of Indonesia's GDP, limiting the direct effect of U.S. tariff policy. Specifically, the OECD recorded that private consumption and investment in Indonesia will be pressured in the first half of 2025 due to weaker business and consumer sentiment, fiscal-policy uncertainty and high borrowing costs. Externally, rising global trade tensions and falling commodity prices are expected to weigh on Indonesia's exports, reflected in BPS data showing a 10.77 percent month-on-month (MoM) contraction in exports in April 2025. The OECD forecasts that domestic demand in Indonesia will recover gradually in the second half of 2025 through 2026. It also projects Indonesian inflation to move toward 2.3 percent in 2025 and 3.0 percent in 2026, as the electricity tariff discount effect ends and the rupiah depreciation effect fades. Public investment spending through the BPI Danantara fund is seen as having potential to act as a catalyst for investment recovery. However, the OECD warned of additional risks from possible capital outflows from Indonesia, driven by both global and domestic uncertainty. These pressures could weaken the rupiah, widen the current-account deficit and increase imported-inflation risk. In 2025, the government targets a 5.2 percent YoY economic growth. Yet Indonesia's 1Q25 growth was only 4.87 percent YoY (versus 5.11 percent YoY in 1Q24 and 5.02 percent YoY in 4Q24), below the 5.2 percent target. Household consumption slowed to 4.89 percent YoY (versus 4.91 percent YoY in 1Q24). Following this data, Bank Indonesia reduced its 2025 growth outlook range from 4.7-5.5 percent to 4.6-5.4 percent, marking the second downgrade by the central bank this year.",

      "content": "1. OJK issued Circular Letter No. 7 of 2025 requiring health-insurance products to apply a co-payment risk sharing that must be borne by policyholders of at least 10 percent of the total claim amount, with a maximum limit of 300,000 rupiah per outpatient claim and 3,000,000 rupiah per inpatient claim. The circular also allows insurers to set higher maximum co-payment limits if agreed with policyholders. This rule applies only to health-insurance products with indemnity principles and managed-care schemes, and excludes micro-insurance products. 2. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) set the Coal Reference Price (HBA) for the first period of June 2025 down 16.7 percent MoM to US$100.97 per ton. The HBA also fell 8.5 percent compared with the second period of May 2025. 3. Macquarie analyst Jim Lennon said global nickel oversupply is expected to continue until 2027-2028 as demand growth slows amid expanding production capacity. Nickel prices on the London Metal Exchange recently hit a five-year low of US$13,865 per ton on 7 April 2025 before climbing back to US$15,380 per ton on Thursday. Lennon noted that US$15,000 per ton is a critical level for producers, as half of existing producers could incur losses if prices fall below that level. Nickel demand growth is slowing due to increased use of cheaper lithium-iron-phosphate batteries. Reuters reported that analyst consensus has cut the 2030 nickel demand estimate for the battery sector to 967,000 tons (versus 518,000 tons realized in 2024), far below the consensus estimate made two years ago of 1.5 million tons. 4. Singapore banks DBS and UOB announced a total loan of IDR 6.7 trillion to finance the development of data-center projects of Singaporean company DayOne and the Indonesia Investment Authority (INA). Reuters reported that this loan represents the largest rupiah-denominated financing ever in the data-center sector. The funds will be used to develop and operate three data centres with a total capacity of 72 MW in Batam, targeted for completion in 2025. 5. The controlling shareholder of Jembo Cable Company ($JECC), PT Monaspertama Persada, purchased 53.1 million JECC shares at 600 rupiah per share on 2 June 2025, 43.9 percent lower than the closing price of 1,070 rupiah per share on the same day. The transaction value was about IDR 31.9 billion. After the transaction, PT Monaspertama Persada’s ownership in JECC rose from approximately 52.57 percent to 59.59 percent. 6. The controlling shareholder of Steel Pipe Industry of Indonesia ($ISSP), PT Cakra Bhakti Para Putra, bought 6.8 million ISSP shares at 296 rupiah per share on 4 June 2025. The transaction value was about IDR 2 billion. After the transaction, PT Cakra Bhakti Para Putra’s ownership in ISSP increased from 56.3 percent to 56.4 percent.",

Iwan noted that UNTR is actively looking for new mineral mines in Australia and Canada, because most large-scale mineral mines in Indonesia are already owned by other companies and are not for sale. He explained that UNTR has been monitoring almost all mineral mines in Australia, especially in Western Australia and Queensland, but the company has not yet reached an agreement with any mine owners it wishes to acquire in Australia. Iwan estimated that the capital expenditure needed for acquisitions would range between US$500 million and US$1 billion within one year.",
