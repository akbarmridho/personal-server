      "content": "BPS notes that Indonesia's economic growth reached +5.02% YoY in Q424 (vs. Q324: +4.95% YoY), exceeding the consensus expectation of +4.98% YoY. Quarterly, Indonesia's economic growth was +0.53% QoQ in Q424 (vs. Q324: +1.5% QoQ), lower than the consensus expectation of +0.56% QoQ. This result means that Indonesia's economic growth throughout 2024 only reached +5.03% YoY (vs. 2023: +5.05% YoY), lower than the government's target of +5.2% YoY and marking the lowest growth in the last 3 years, although it is still within Bank Indonesia's target range of +4.7-5.5% YoY. From the expenditure side, domestic consumption (+4.94% YoY vs. 2023: +4.82% YoY) and gross fixed capital formation (+4.61% YoY vs. 2023: +4.40% YoY) were the largest contributors to economic growth during 2024, contributing +2.6 percentage point and +1.43 percentage point, respectively. Meanwhile, net exports recorded a negative contribution of -0.01 percentage point due to an increase in imports (+7.95% YoY vs. 2023: +1.65% YoY) which was higher than export growth (+6.51% YoY vs. 2023: +1.32% YoY). Government consumption (+6.61% YoY vs. 2023: +2.95% YoY) contributed +0.48 percentage point, with the remaining contribution of +0.53 percentage point coming from other variables. Spatially, weaker economic growth was pressed by the Java and Sumatra regions, reaching only +4.92% YoY and +4.45% YoY in 2024, respectively, much lower than Maluku and Papua (+7.81% YoY), Sulawesi (+6.18% YoY), Bali and Nusa Tenggara (+5.04% YoY), and Kalimantan (+5.52% YoY). The release of 2024 economic growth data came just a few days after BPS announced that Indonesia's consumer price index inflation accelerated to 0.76% YoY in January 2025 (vs. December 2024: 1.57% YoY inflation), well below the consensus expectation which predicted inflation at 1.88% YoY.",

      "content": "Philippine Senate President, Francis Escudero, stated on Thursday (6/2) that the Philippine Congress may ratify the bill banning exports of mineral ore - including nickel ore - as early as June 2025. The bill aims to ban the export of raw ore to boost the downstream mining industry, with the implementation of the new ban taking effect 5 years after the bill is signed to give miners time to build smelters. The Philippines is the world's second-largest supplier of nickel ore, with most of its exports going to China. The Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines and the Nickel Industry Association of the Philippines stated that a ban on mineral ore exports would cause mine closures and major disruptions to the existing supply chain, given that many mines have long-term contracts with international buyers. Director General of Minerals and Coal at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Tri Winarno, stated that the government targets nickel production of around 220 million tons in 2025, not significantly different from the Work Plan and Budget (RKAB) target for nickel production in 2024 of 240 million tons. Tri also mentioned that there are currently no concrete steps to cut the 2025 nickel production target, as the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources is still in the evaluation stage.",

Ltd., controlled more than 70% of Indonesia's nickel smelter capacity in 2023, both being among the initial investors when Indonesia began pushing for domestic nickel downstreaming. C4ADS highlighted that the influence of Chinese companies in Indonesia's nickel smelter industry may limit Indonesia's ability to control and shape the industry for Indonesia's benefit.
