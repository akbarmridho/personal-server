      "title": "Oil, Gold, and CPO Prices Collectively Increase",
      "content": "The prices of several commodities have increased in recent days. Oil and gold increased in Monday (6/2) night trading, while crude palm oil (CPO) increased in Tuesday (6/3) trading. Here is a summary of news regarding the price movements of these three commodities: Oil Brent crude futures for August 2025 delivery closed up +2.4% at 63.9 US dollars per barrel on Monday (6/2) followed by a +1.2% increase to 64.7 US dollars per barrel on Tuesday (6/3). This price increase responded to two developments: 1) the OPEC+ decision to maintain stable production increases and 2) the decline in the number of rigs in the US and supply disruptions in Canada. OPEC+ on Saturday (5/31) decided to maintain the July 2025 production increase of 411,000 barrels per day. This is the third consecutive month where OPEC+ is increasing production by the same amount, thus easing market expectations for a more aggressive increase. Furthermore, the US reported that the number of rigs continued to decline throughout May 2025, reaching its lowest level since 2021. On the other hand, Reuters estimated that 7% of oil production in Canada was impacted by forest fires in Alberta province. The price of Brent crude itself has decreased by -13.5% YTD as of Tuesday (6/3), mainly driven by OPEC+'s production increase plan which exceeded initial expectations and a decline in demand amidst a weakening global economic growth outlook due to trade wars. Gold Spot gold prices一度rose +3.1% to 3,392 US dollars per troy ounce on Monday (6/2), hitting the highest level in the last three weeks, before falling -0.9% to close at 3,357 US dollars per troy ounce on Tuesday (6/3). This increase occurred along with rising investor concerns about global uncertainty and the weakening of the US Dollar Index (DXY). The US plan to increase steel and aluminum import tariffs from 25% to 50%, plus Ukraine's attack on Russia late last week increased investor concerns. The DXY itself closed down -0.7% at 98.7 in Monday (6/2) trading. Gold prices have increased by +28% YTD as of Tuesday (6/3) and had reached an all time high of 3,500 US dollars per troy ounce last April (4/22). This YTD increase was mainly driven by trade tensions causing investors to shift to safe haven assets. The DXY has weakened by -9.6% YTD as of Tuesday (6/3). CPO CPO futures for August 2025 delivery briefly rose +2.6% to 3,977 ringgit per ton before closing up +1.4% at 3,934 ringgit per ton on Tuesday (6/3). This increase followed the Indian government's decision to cut the basic import tax on crude edible oils from 20% to 10% on Friday (5/30). This policy aims to lower domestic food prices while supporting the local refining industry. With this adjustment, the total import tariff for crude edible oil decreased from 27.5% to 16.5%, considering there are additional levies besides the basic tariff. Meanwhile, the tariff for processed edible oil remained unchanged, widening the tariff gap between crude and processed edible oils, thus encouraging importers to switch to crude oil imports. CPO prices have fallen -13.2% YTD as of Tuesday (6/3), mainly driven by decreased demand from India. India's CPO imports even weakened to their lowest level in 14 years in January 2025.",
