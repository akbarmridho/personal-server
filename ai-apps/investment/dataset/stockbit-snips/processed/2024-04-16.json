      "title": "Important Developments During Lebaran Holiday",
      "content": "During the Idulfitri 2024 holiday period, several developments need investors' attention:\n\n1. US inflation again exceeds expectations – the US recorded inflation of 3.5% year-on-year in March 2024 (versus February 2024: 3.2%), surpassing the consensus level of 3.4%. This marks the third consecutive month since January 2024 where US inflation data came in higher than expected, reinforcing the “higher for longer rates” narrative. According to analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the market now expects the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates in the third quarter of 2024, later than the previous expectation of a June 2024 rate cut. Implications of the US inflation development on Tuesday (16/4):\n- The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose from around 4.2% at the end of March 2024 to about 4.6%.\n- The US Dollar Index (DXY) increased from level 104 at the end of March 2024 to around 106.\n- The S&P 500 index fell 3.7% month-to-date.\n- For Indonesia, the negative impact is visible in the rupiah’s depreciation against the US dollar, weakening from 15,880 at the end of March 2024 to 16,176.\n\n2. Escalating geopolitical tension – on 13 April 2024, Iran launched an attack on Israel. This escalation is pushing up the prices of several commodities, such as crude oil, gold, and silver.\n\n3. Commodity price increases due to supply issues and/or better demand outlook – in addition to geopolitical tension, several commodities have strengthened because of supply constraints and improved demand prospects.\n- Crude oil: Driven by expectations of a global oil deficit in 2024 as OPEC+ production cuts tighten supply, and higher demand forecasts from stronger-than-expected US and China economic data.\n- Tin: Supported by reduced supply uncertainty from Indonesia and Myanmar exports, better manufacturing activity in the US and China, and the ban on Russian metal mining production for trading on the London Metal Exchange.\n- Copper: Potential shortage due to the closure of one of the world’s largest copper mines, the Cobre mine in Panama, together with increased demand for copper in the energy transition.\n- Nickel: The US and the United Kingdom have imposed trade bans on Russian commodities, including nickel, copper and aluminium, increasing price volatility.\n- Pulp: Supply disruptions from Finnish producers following port demonstrations since early March 2024.\n\nKey Takeaway\nThe series of negative sentiments above caused the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) to weaken by 1.68% on Tuesday (16/4), with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as property (-3.25%), technology (-2.85%) and financials (-2.49%) falling sharply.\n\nHowever, we consider this correction could be an opportunity for investors to buy banking stocks at more attractive valuations, because, in our view, their fundamentals and prospects remain solid.\n\nMeanwhile, the upward trend in commodity prices and the stronger US dollar could have a positive impact on commodity-related issuers.\n\n- Gaikindo reported wholesale car sales in Indonesia in March 2024 amounted to 74,724 units (+5.8% month-on-month, –26.2% year-on-year). Over the first three months of 2024, wholesale car sales reached only 214,997 units (-23.9% year-on-year), representing 19.5% of the 2024 target of 1.1 million units.\n- The Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) recorded domestic motorcycle sales in March 2024 of 583,747 units (+4.5% month-on-month, –7.8% year-on-year). Over the first three months of 2024, domestic motorcycle sales totaled 1.74 million units (-4.9% year-on-year), accounting for 26.7-28% of the 2024 target of 6.2-6.5 million units.\n- China’s gross domestic product grew 5.3% year-on-year and 1.6% quarter-on-quarter in 1Q24 (versus 4Q23: 5.2% year-on-year, 1% quarter-on-quarter), beating consensus expectations of 4.6% year-on-year and 1.4% quarter-on-quarter.\n- The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have banned Russian-origin nickel from being traded on the London Metal Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The ban applies to nickel produced after 13 April 2024 and aims to reduce export revenues for Russia amid the war in Ukraine that has been ongoing since 2022. Russia contributes about 6% of global refined nickel production.\n- Commodity-analysis firm Kpler reported that China imported 97.43 million tonnes of coal (+16.9% year-on-year) in 1Q24. This surge occurred while consensus forecasts expected China’s coal imports in 2024 to be flat at 450-500 million tonnes (versus 2023 actual 474.42 million tonnes).",
