A parliamentary source said the third amnesty will target shadow economy activities, both legal and illegal, that are not reported for tax. However, a tax analyst from the Center for Indonesia Taxation Analysis, Fajry Akbar, doubts that shadow economy participants will join the amnesty. He urges the government and parliament to abandon the amnesty plan because it could create moral hazard and damage the government's image and credibility.",

      "title": "BBRI 10M24: Net profit +5.3% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) recorded net profit (bank only) of IDR 4.1 trillion (down 8.2% YoY, down 26% MoM) in October 2024, resulting in a net profit (bank only) for the first ten months of 2024 of IDR 45.7 trillion (+5.3% YoY). Negative aspects: Credit Cost (CoC) rose again and Net Interest Margin (NIM) fell. Positive aspects: operating expense (opex) remained controlled.\n\nCoC rose again: after a two-month improvement, BBRI's bank-only CoC in October 2024 increased to 3.15% (+131 bps YoY, +38 bps MoM), still below the May and July 2024 peak of 3.8-3.9%. This pushed the CoC for the first ten months of 2024 to 3.19% (vs. 2.57% in the same period 2023), worse than the FY24 management guidance that targets a maximum of 3%. The CoC increase was driven by a rise in provision expenses in October 2024 to IDR 3.2 trillion (+83% YoY, +15% MoM), bringing total provisions for the first ten months to IDR 31.6 trillion (+36% YoY). The higher provisions pressured monthly net profit, although the Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) (bank only) remained at IDR 8.5 trillion (+19% YoY, -11% MoM).\n\nNIM weakened: BBRI's bank-only NIM fell to 6.28% (-12 bps YoY, -20 bps MoM) in October 2024 after a prior upward trend. This resulted in a ten-month NIM of 6.34% (vs. 6.73% in the same period 2023). The decline was due to a shift in asset mix toward lower-yielding assets, with deposits at Bank Indonesia rising +17% YoY while holdings of securities (including government bonds) fell -8.6% YoY.\n\nEfficiency maintained: BBRI kept operational efficiency by reducing opex to IDR 5.4 trillion (-2.8% YoY, +19% MoM) in October 2024, driven by lower labor costs. Over the first ten months, opex grew only +4.4% YoY to IDR 48.6 trillion, supporting a PPOP increase of +15% YoY to IDR 89.5 trillion.\n\nKey Takeaway: Although CoC rose in October 2024, we remain wait-and-see to determine whether this is caused by a front-loading effect that will normalize by year-end, or signals deteriorating asset quality. Market concerns also focus on the performance of BBRI's subsidiary PT Permodalan Nasional Madani, which is not reflected in the bank-only results.",
