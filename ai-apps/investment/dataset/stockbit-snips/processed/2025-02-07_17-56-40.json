      "title": "MSCI: BREN, PTRO, and CUAN Will Not Enter February 2025 Review",
      "content": "MSCI announced that Barito Renewables Energy (BREN), Petrindo Jaya Kreasi (CUAN), and Petrosea (PTRO) will not be included in the MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index in the February 2025 review following analysis and input regarding potential investability constraints. The announcement for the February 2025 MSCI index review is scheduled for February 11, 2025. Responding to this issue, BREN President Director, Hendra Tan, stated that MSCI's decision is entirely the index provider's authority and outside the company's control. Hendra mentioned that BREN's focus remains on delivering sustainable growth. Previously, BREN was removed from the FTSE Global Equity Series - Large Cap index by FTSE Russell on September 19, 2024, only one month after the announcement of its inclusion in the index, due to hitting the free float rule because of high shareholder concentration, where 97% of the total issued shares were only held by 4 shareholders. BREN's stock price subsequently dropped -34% from the level of 11,025 rupiah per share on September 19, 2024, to 7,225 rupiah per share on September 22, 2024. Nevertheless, BREN provided clarification to the IDX on September 22, 2024, stating that the number of shares meeting the free float requirement based on IDX provisions amounted to 15.6 billion shares or equivalent to 11.66% of the shares outstanding as of September 19, 2024. This amount did not show a significant change compared to the free float portion based on the IPO prospectus of 11.73%. Following MSCI's announcement today, Friday (7/2), the three stocks closed lower, with BREN at -19.94%, CUAN at -19.96%, and PTRO at -24.61%. Key Takeaway: MSCI mentioned that they will still review the eligibility of these stocks as part of future index reviews and will provide further communication as needed.",

The Chairman of the Central Executive Board of Real Estat Indonesia, Joko Suranto, stated that currently, 17,000 subsidized houses have been built by developers but cannot yet proceed with credit agreements because the government has not realized the FLPP funds. The government has budgeted 28.27 trillion rupiah for the FLPP program in 2025 to finance 220,000 subsidized housing units. However, the government is currently working on a scheme to change the FLPP funding composition to 50% borne by the State Budget (APBN) and 50% from banking liquidity—changing from the existing scheme where 75% is borne by APBN and 25% from bank liquidity—so that the number of subsidized houses that can be financed increases to 330,000 units.",
