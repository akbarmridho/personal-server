      "title": "The Fed Cuts Interest Rates by 25 Bps, In Line with Expectations",
      "content": "The US central bank, The Fed, decided to cut interest rates by -25 bps to 4.5-4.75%, meeting the consensus expectation. This decision follows an interest rate cut of -50 bps in the previous meeting in September 2024. The Fed Chief, Jerome Powell, said that the Fed's interest rates are on the right path towards a neutral level, which neither stimulates nor restricts the economy. Powell mentioned that they are confident the inflation rate can sustainably decline towards the 2% target, while the labor market remains healthy despite broadly cooling down. Powell also said that the results of the US presidential election will not impact US monetary policy in the short term. The President-elect, Donald Trump, previously affirmed that he will allow Powell to continue serving as The Fed Chair until the end of his term in May 2026. Powell also stated that he would not resign if asked by Trump. Based on the September 2024 dot plot projections, The Fed officials anticipated that they would still cut interest rates by another -25 bps until the end of 2024, with further cuts totaling -100 bps during 2025. The Fed will only update its dot plot projections at the December 2024 meeting. Meanwhile, the market still expects The Fed to lower the benchmark interest rate by another -25 bps at the December 2024 meeting, although with a slightly decreasing probability from 82.7% to 74.7% after Trump's victory. Responding to the news of The Fed's interest rate cut, the three US stock exchange indices closed relatively stronger on Thursday (7/11), with the S&P 500 index rising +0.74%, Nasdaq surging +1.51%, and DJIA relatively flat at -0%. Previously, these three indices broke all-time high records after Trump won the election on Wednesday (6/11). Meanwhile, the US dollar index (DXY) weakened by -0.55% to the level of 104.5 on Thursday (7/11). Domestically, the IHSG closed higher by +0.6% today, Friday (8/11), but it was more driven by the rise in $BREN (+14.6%), $TPIA (+8.6%), and $AMMN (+3.5%). The IHSG recorded a net foreign outflow of 2.2 trillion rupiah today. Meanwhile, the Rupiah exchange rate against the US Dollar strengthened by +0.41% to the level of 15,670, with the 10-year government bond yield falling -5 bps to the level of 6.74%. Key Takeaway: Generally, The Fed's interest rate cut on Thursday (7/11) was anticipated by the market, so it did not cause a dramatic market reaction. In the short term, we assess that Trump's victory will not immediately provide a significant impact on The Fed's interest rate policy. The market seems to be waiting to see the extent of implementation of the policies floated by Trump to gauge the impact on inflation and interest rate policy.",
