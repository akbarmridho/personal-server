      "title": "BEI Implements Trading Halt, First Time Since End of 2020",
      "content": "The Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) applied a temporary trading halt for 30 minutes near the end of the session on Tuesday (18/3) after the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) fell more than 5%. This marks the first time BEI has applied a trading halt since the end of 2020. After trading resumed, the IHSG sank to -7.1%, the largest intraday decline since September 2011, before selling pressure eased and the index closed down -3.84%. Based on weighting, the five stocks that most pressured the IHSG today were DCII (-20%), TPIA (-18.42%), BREN (-11.79%), BBRI (-3.92%) and BBCA (-3.49%).\n\nThe sudden collapse of the IHSG surprised market participants, given that stock markets in other Asian countries were strengthening. The drop can be linked to several recent negative sentiments:\n- Speculation on Sri Mulyani Resignation: In recent days, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani was rumored to be dismissed in a cabinet reshuffle or to resign. After initially avoiding comment (https://www.kompas.id/artikel/makna-senyum-sri-mulyani-di-balik-isu-reshuffle-kabinet), she clarified this afternoon (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-18/indonesia-finance-chief-focused-on-job-amid-resignation-talk) that she is not resigning. Gerindra Party daily chairman Sufmi Dasco Ahmad said on Monday (17/3) that President Prabowo Subianto has no plan for a near‑term cabinet reshuffle, including the finance minister position.\n- Early Fiscal Deficit: Last week the market was shocked by an earlier‑than‑expected 2025 fiscal deficit, with the 2M25 deficit reaching 31.2 trillion rupiah or 0.13% of GDP. This is the first time the state budget posted a deficit in the first two months of the year since 2021, according to Bloomberg. The shortfall was driven by a 20.8% YoY drop in state revenue, with tax receipts falling 39.9% YoY. This afternoon Sri Mulyani said gross tax revenue for 1‑17 March 2025 grew 6.6% YoY. Concerns about the fiscal deficit widening beyond the 2.53% of GDP target attracted investor attention amid various government programs.\n- Concerns on Economic Growth: The drop in tax receipts may indicate weakening Indonesian economy, according to the head of the Indonesian Center for Shopping Management Association (DPD Jakarta), Mualim Wijoyo. In February 2025 Indonesia experienced a 0.09% YoY deflation, the first annual deflation since March 2000. Earlier this year Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut the BI Rate by 25 basis points to 5.75% to stimulate growth. Bank Indonesia also lowered its 2025 growth outlook from a range of 4.8‑5.6% YoY to 4.7‑5.5% YoY due to weaker consumption, employment, investment and exports.\n- Forced Liquidation of Margin Traders and Inflow Drag Ahead of Holiday: According to a fund manager at SGMC Capital Pte., Mohit Mirpuri, the sudden IHSG plunge was also triggered by a wave of forced liquidations, especially among margin traders. Mirpuri explained that sentiment remains weak and there is no new inflow to support the index ahead of the long Eid al‑Fitr holiday period (28 March‑7 April 2025).\n\nWith today’s weakness, the IHSG has fallen 12.1% YTD, pressured by foreign outflows of approximately 29.5 trillion rupiah.",

      "content": "Given the various concerns above, investors should pay attention to the following factors:\n- The Bank Indonesia (BI) rate announcement tomorrow, Wednesday (19/3). Although a rate cut could support economic growth, it may put pressure on the rupiah against the US dollar.\n- Execution of government programs aimed at boosting economic growth and enhancing investor confidence.\n\nInvestors may use this market correction to accumulate, as the IHSG valuation is now attractive at 10.5x 1‑Year Forward P/E, near a 3‑standard‑deviation low over the past ten years and comparable to the valuation during the Covid‑19 pandemic. The following issuers are considered to have good quality and may be considered:\n- BBCA: consistent growth track record and strong risk management.\n- ASII: resilient performance from a diversified business and relatively high dividend yield (~8%).\n- TSPC: defensive, holds substantial US‑dollar cash and offers a relatively high dividend yield (~8%).\n\nInvestors can also manage market volatility risk by considering FR bonds and retail SBNs:\n- PBS032 offers a yield of about 6.23% per year with a tenor of roughly 1 year.\n- ST014 (floating with floor) can be bought on Bibit until 16 April 2025: ST014‑T2 has a minimum yield of 6.5% per year, maturing on 10 April 2027; ST014‑T4 has a minimum yield of 6.6% per year, maturing on 10 April 2029.",

      "content": "The Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD) reduced its global growth projection to 3.1% YoY for 2025 and 3.0% YoY for 2026, each 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points lower than previously forecast, citing trade barriers and heightened geopolitical uncertainty that weigh on investment and household spending. The OECD also lowered its Indonesia growth projection to 4.9% YoY for 2025 and 5.0% YoY for 2026, each 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points below earlier estimates. The Indonesian government targets 5.2% YoY growth for 2025.\n\nThe Secretary General of the Indonesian Nickel Miners Association, Meidy Katrin Lengkey, said on Monday (17/3) that the government's plan to raise mineral and coal (minerba) royalty rates could force nickel mines to shut down. APNI's survey found that a proposed 14% royalty would cause several miners to incur losses. The current Indonesian nickel royalty is 10%, the highest among major nickel‑producing countries such as Russia (max 8%), Australia (2.5‑5%), China (2‑10%), Vietnam (10%), Philippines (5‑9%), Brazil (2%), South Africa (0.5‑7%) and Canada (5‑10%).\n\nState Secretary Prasetyo Hadi said on Monday (17/3) that the appointment of civil servants (CPNS) will be completed by June 2025 at the latest, while the appointment of government employees on contract (PPPK) will be completed by October 2025. This statement came about a week after the government and parliament agreed to postpone the CPNS selection of 2024 to 1 October 2025, with PPPK appointments delayed to 1 March 2026.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce reported that US retail sales grew 0.2% month‑over‑month in February 2025 (vs. January -1.2% MoM), below the consensus expectation of 0.6% MoM. Year‑over‑year, US retail sales rose 3.1% in February 2025 (vs. January 3.9% YoY).\n\nChina's National Bureau of Statistics reported that Chinese retail sales grew 4% YoY over the 2M25 period (vs. December 2024 3.7% YoY), in line with consensus. Household consumption in 2M25 was driven by holiday spending during the Chinese New Year.\n\nIndonesia's Statistics Agency (BPS) reported that crude and processed palm oil exports in February 2025 reached 2.06 million metric tons (+62.2% MoM, +45.1% YoY), the highest in four months. The increase was driven by the government's export tariff reduction implemented in September 2024, which shifted buyers from Malaysia.\n\nThe Director of the Palm Oil Export Levy Management Agency, Kabul Wijayanto, said on Tuesday (18/3) that Indonesia plans to raise the CPO export levy from a range of 3‑7.5% to 4.5‑10% of the CPO reference price. The new levy is intended to fund mandatory B40 biodiesel. The new tariff will be applied three days after the regulation is issued, which is still in process.",
