      "title": "Rupiah Weakens Since Early June 2024, Approaches Level 16,300",
      "content": "The Indonesian rupiah weakened against the US dollar intraday, breaching the 16,300 level on Thursday, 6 June 2024, marking the weakest level since April 2020, before closing slightly higher by +0.02% at 16,279. Since the start of June 2024, the rupiah has fallen 0.3% month‑to‑date as of Thursday (6/6). The depreciation occurred alongside a weakening of the US dollar index (DXY), which fell 0.6% month‑to‑date to the 104 level on Thursday (6/6). The rupiah’s weakness coincided with a narrowing of Indonesia’s trade‑surplus due to commodity price normalization, outflows of funds during the Hajj season, and dividend repatriation by foreign investors in Indonesian companies. Since early June, the Indonesian capital market recorded net foreign outflows, with net outflows of IDR 43 billion in the bond market on Tuesday (4/6) and IDR 53 billion in the equity market on Wednesday (5/6). The US labor market showed weakness: the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that April 2024 job openings fell to about 8.06 million (versus 8.36 million in March 2024), below the consensus of 8.36 million and the lowest since February 2021. ADP reported private‑sector payroll hiring in May 2024 at 152,000 (versus 188,000 in April 2024), also below the consensus of 175,000. In line with the soft US labor data, the market now expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in September 2024; the CME FedWatch Tool shows a 78.3% probability of a September rate cut on Thursday (6/6), up from 59.6% on Monday (3/6).",

      "content": "Reuters reported that emerging‑market equities in Asia experienced a second consecutive month of foreign outflows in May 2024, driven by strong US economic data that heightened skepticism about a Federal Reserve rate cut. The report noted that stock markets in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan posted a combined net foreign outflow of US$3.58 billion in May 2024, following a US$4.92 billion outflow in April 2024. Indonesia’s equity market contributed a net foreign outflow of US$881 million. By contrast, Taiwan’s market recorded a net foreign inflow of US$2.41 billion in May 2024, reversing a US$4.61 billion outflow in April 2024, driven by AI‑related sentiment.",
