      "title": "The Fed Cuts Interest Rate, US-China Reach New Deal",
      "content": "The U.S. Federal Reserve, on Wednesday (29 Oct local time), decided to cut the U.S. policy rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.75-4%, in line with consensus expectations. This marks the Fed’s second consecutive rate cut amid concerns over a weakening U.S. labor market. \n\nNevertheless, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed does not guarantee further rate cuts at the next meeting in December 2025, given the slowdown in the release of U.S. economic data caused by a government shutdown that began in early October 2025, and because U.S. inflation remains high. For context, at the previous meeting the Fed projected two more rate cuts by the end of 2025 to a range of 3.5-3.75%. \n\nIn addition to the rate decision, the Fed announced it will halt the reduction of its balance-sheet assets (quantitative tightening) starting 1 Dec 2025, ending the process that began in 2022, as liquidity in the money market tightens and bank reserves fall. \n\nIn a separate development, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday (30 Oct) that he will cut tariffs on China by 10 percentage points, reducing the total tariff on Chinese-origin imports from 57% to 47%. The announcement followed Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. \n\nTrump also said the United States has reached an agreement with China that includes: China will not impose drastic restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports to the U.S.; China will continue importing U.S. soybeans; and China will combat illegal trade of fentanyl precursors to the United States. The agreement will last one year and is expected to be renewed annually. In addition, both sides discussed U.S. chip access – including AI chips from Nvidia – amid recent Chinese restrictions on such chips and a push for domestic technology substitution. \n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nBecause inflation is a key factor in the Fed’s rate-cut decision, we assess that the U.S.–China agreement – including the tariff reduction – could be a positive development for U.S. inflation outlook. However, the unresolved government shutdown remains a market uncertainty that investors should monitor. \n\nThe market already appears to be pricing in the positive developments from the Trump-Xi meeting, as reflected in muted market reactions with several indices slipping slightly on Thursday (30 Oct) afternoon, such as the Shanghai Composite (-0.73%), Europe’s Stoxx 50 (-0.50%) and the S&P Futures (-0.04%).",
