      "title": "2025 Economic Policy Package",
      "content": "The Government on Monday (16/12) announced a series of economic policy packages and a selective 12% VAT for 2025. Here are some of our important notes:\n- Selective 12% VAT: The Government stated that the VAT increase to 12% will only be imposed on goods and services classified as luxury or premium. Based on the presentation at the press conference, here are some items that will be subject to 12% VAT:\n- - Premium rice, premium fruits, and premium meat (such as wagyu)\n- - Expensive fish, shrimp, and premium crustaceans (such as king crab)\n- - Premium education services\n- - Premium health services\n- - Electricity tariffs for customers in the 3,500-6,600 VA category\nThe Government has not yet announced the detailed complete list of luxury goods and services subject to 12% VAT. Meanwhile, the government will bear a 1 percentage point VAT increase (DTP VAT) for wheat flour, industrial sugar, and Minyakita cooking oil, so the VAT will remain at 11%. Basic necessities such as rice, meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, and milk will remain exempt from VAT.\n- Food and Electricity Assistance: The Government will provide food assistance in the form of 10 kg of rice per month for 2 months (January and February 2025) for 16 million recipients. Additionally, the government will provide an electricity tariff discount of 50% for 2 months (January and February 2025) for customers in the 2,200 VA category and below, covering ~80 million customers or equivalent to ~97% of PLN customers.\n- Support for Labor-Intensive Sectors: The Government will absorb Income Tax (PPh 21) for workers in labor-intensive sectors with salaries up to 10 million rupiah per month. Furthermore, labor-intensive industries wishing to revitalize machinery will be given an incentive in the form of a special interest rate of 5%.\n- Extension of Property Sector Incentives: The Government is extending the 100% DTP VAT incentive for landed houses and apartments until June 2025. For the July-December 2025 period, this incentive will be reduced to 50% DTP VAT. This incentive applies to residences with a maximum selling price of 5 billion rupiah on the first 2 billion rupiah. \n- Hybrid Car Incentives: The Government will absorb 3% Luxury Goods Sales Tax (PPnBM) for hybrid cars. Consequently, the PPnBM for hybrid cars will decrease from the current 7-8% to 4-5%. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty regarding the plan to increase the PPnBM for hybrid cars. Previously, Kompas reported in July 2024 on the potential increase in hybrid car PPnBM by +2-4 percentage points to 10-12%, following the nullification of Government Regulation No. 74/2021 concerning Motor Vehicle PPnBM post realization of minimum investment of 5 trillion rupiah in the battery electric vehicle (BEV) industry.\n- Extension of MSME Incentives: The Government will extend the imposition of a 0.5% tax for MSMEs with turnover up to 4.8 billion rupiah per year for 1 year specifically for MSME actors who have fully utilized this incentive (7 years). With this extension, MSMEs that have received incentives for 7 years will receive an additional duration of 1 year. For MSME actors who have only enjoyed this incentive for less than 7 years, the tax incentive they receive will remain valid for a maximum of 7 years.",

This expectation has changed compared to 1 month ago, when economists still projected Bank Indonesia would cut the rate by 25 bps in December 2024. This change in expectation is driven by the continued weakening of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar. Economists have also lowered their expectations for BI Rate cuts during 2025 from 100 bps to 75 bps due to the potential for a longer-term strengthening of the US dollar stemming from the protectionist policies of the US President-elect, Donald Trump.",
