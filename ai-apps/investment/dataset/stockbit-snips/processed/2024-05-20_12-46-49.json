      "title": "Base Metals Increasingly Hot, Nickel Returns Above US$21,000/Ton",
      "content": "A number of base metal commodities experienced a rally in price increases over the last week. Based on the London Metal Exchange (LME) reference prices for 3-month futures contracts, nickel prices jumped +11.2% WoW to a level of 21,080 US dollars per ton, followed by copper which rose +6.6% WoW to a level of 10,668 US dollars per ton, and a strengthening tin price of +6.7% WoW to a level of 34,251 US dollars per ton. There are a number of factors that support this commodity price rally, including: - Easing US inflation - US inflation data for April 2024 reported a decline to the 3.4% YoY level (vs. Mar 2024: 3.5% YoY), in line with consensus expectations. This result ended the previous 3-month trend that consecutively exceeded consensus expectations, thus reviving the possibility of the Fed starting interest rate cuts in 2024. This has the potential to increase economic activity, which can increase industrial demand for base metal commodities. - China government stimulus - On May 17, 2024, the Chinese government began issuing bonds worth 1 trillion yuan (138 billion US dollars), aimed as stimulus to boost key economic sectors in the country. This stimulus has the potential to increase economic activity in China, thus becoming a positive sentiment for global commodity price movements. - Supply disruption concerns - The wave of riots in New Caledonia, which is the world's third-largest nickel-producing country. The riots raised concerns about disruptions to the world's nickel supply. - Delayed production permits from Indonesian mining - The approval process for mineral mining RKAB (Work Plan and Budget for Mineral and Coal Mining) is still running slow in Indonesia. The government is reported not to have provided an update on the status of nickel RKAB approvals in the last 2 months. As of the end of March 2024, only 15 tin mining RKABs have been approved. This is feared to cause operational production disruptions. Indonesia is an important player in global base metal production. Based on U.S. Geological Survey estimates in 2023, Indonesia contributes to 50% of global nickel production, 18% of global tin production, and 4% of global copper production. Key Takeaway: The rise in base metal commodity prices has the potential to increase the Average Selling Price (ASP), which can lead to margin increases for the producing issuers. Along with this commodity rally, issuers that proxy these commodities experienced price appreciation in the last week: - Nickel: $MBMA (+15.18%), $INCO (+14.19%), $ANTM (+8.88%), $NCKL (+6.19%) - Copper: $AMMN (+6.6%), $MDKA (+2.53%) - Tin: $TINS (+4.3%)",
