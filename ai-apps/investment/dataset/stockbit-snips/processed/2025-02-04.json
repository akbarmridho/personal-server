      "title": "US Delays Tariffs for Canada & Mexico; China Responds with Tariffs for the US",
      "content": "President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced a postponement of the implementation of an import tariff of 25 percent for Canada and Mexico for 30 days while negotiations are ongoing to increase law‑enforcement efforts at the borders of those countries with the United States. At the same time, an additional import tariff of 10 percent for China will take effect as scheduled on Tuesday (4/2) local time. This agreement comes only a few days after Trump announced last weekend that he would impose a 25 percent import tariff on Canada and Mexico and an additional tariff of 10 percent on top of the existing tariff for China on Tuesday (4/2). Trump previously said that the tariffs were a response to the flow of narcotics and immigrants coming to the United States from those countries. As the US tariffs become effective, China announced on Tuesday (4/2) afternoon that it will impose additional import tariffs on several US commodities starting 10 February 2025, consisting of: an additional 15 percent tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG); an additional 10 percent tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large‑engine cars, and pickup trucks. In addition to the extra tariffs, China also took several other actions, such as an investigation into alleged anti‑monopoly violations by Google, imposing export restrictions on tungsten and other rare earth elements in technology products, and limiting the operations of several US companies such as Illumina and PVH Corp. Following these developments, the US dollar index (DXY) and US equity futures moved volatile on Tuesday (4/2). DXY rose to above 109 before settling at 108.5. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures fell 0.16 percent after having risen 0.78 percent early in the session. Commodity prices subject to the additional Chinese tariffs also fell, with WTI crude oil futures down 2.06 percent to $71.7 per barrel and natural gas futures down 3.98 percent to $3.22 per MMBtu.",

In addition, how the Chinese government will set the exchange rate range against the US dollar after the long weekend on Wednesday (5/2) will also be a focus for investors because it may give clues about China's stance toward US tariffs.

The agency, which will be supervised by ministers and report directly to the president, will be founded with a capital of around 1,000 trillion rupiah in cash, state‑owned assets, or government shares. This capital amount is based on the combined capital of state‑owned enterprises in 2023, which reached 1,135 trillion rupiah. Bloomberg reported that BPI Danantara is an initiative of President Prabowo to mobilize more funding for strategic projects without inflating the state budget. The Minister of State‑Owned Enterprises, Erick Thohir, did not specify which SOEs would be transferred to BPI Danantara, but national media mentioned that seven SOEs will be managed by the agency in its initial phase: Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), PT PLN, PT Pertamina, Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), Telkom Indonesia (TLKM), and Mining Industry Indonesia (MIND ID).",
