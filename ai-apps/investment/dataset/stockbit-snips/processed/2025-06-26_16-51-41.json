Trump on Wednesday (25/6) called Powell \"very bad\" for not cutting interest rates sharply. Meanwhile, Powell told the US Senate that interest rate policy must be cautious due to the risks posed by Trump's tariff plans to increase inflation.",

Rosmauli mentioned that the regulation regarding the appointment of marketplaces as Article 22 PPh collectors is still in the finalization process internally within the government. Previously, Reuters reported that the tax amount to be imposed would reach 0.5% of the sales revenue of sellers with annual turnover between 500 million rupiah and 4.8 billion rupiah.

      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI) recorded bank only net profit of 1.6 trillion rupiah in May 2025 (-7% YoY, +6% MoM). This result brings the 5M25 net profit to 8.5 trillion rupiah (-1% YoY), relatively lower compared to the consensus expectation which projected 2025F consolidated net profit to grow +4% YoY. On a monthly basis, BBNI's net profit in May 2025 showed a post-Eid recovery, but with a relatively weaker recovery compared to Bank Mandiri ($BMRI) and Bank Central Asia ($BBCA). Based on the 5M25 performance realization, we see indications of a decline in BBNI's performance in 2Q25 compared to 1Q25, unless there is a significant performance improvement in June 2025 from the April-May 2025 level. DPK and Credit Slow Down As of May 2025, BBNI's credit growth was at +7% YoY, slowing down compared to the level as of March 2025 at +9% YoY and below the management's 2025 consolidated guidance in the range of +8-10% YoY. We assess this slowdown occurred along with tight liquidity, which is reflected in the Third Party Funds (DPK) which only grew slightly by +1% YoY as of May 2025, slowing down from a growth of +5% YoY as of March 2025. The Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) rose again to 94.5%, nearing the management's 2025 guidance limit of 95%. Limited credit growth room and tight liquidity caused Net Interest Income (NII) to only grow +3% YoY during 5M25. Non-Interest Income (Non-II) which only grew slightly by +1% YoY and opex which rose +6% YoY caused Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) to be flat year-on-year during 5M25. Provisions Expense Increase Provision expense recorded a decrease of -18% MoM, but still increased by +5% YoY in May 2025, so that during 5M25 provision expense rose +2% YoY. We highlight the increase in provision expense in April-May 2025, where the average provision expense reached ~670 billion rupiah per month, higher than the average in 1Q25 at ~500 billion rupiah per month. This increase is also reflected in the Cost of Credit (CoC) which rose from 0.8% in 1Q25 to 0.9% during 5M25 (vs. 5M24: 1%), although still below the 2025 guidance in the range of 1%. Key Takeaway With a high LDR position that is almost reaching the management's target limit, we assess that liquidity easing becomes the main factor to restore growth room for BBNI. The increase in provision expense in the last 2 months will also be our focus at the 2Q25 earnings call. Furthermore, we also see the potential for a downward revision of the 2025F net profit estimate by consensus, after revisions of -5%/-11% in the last 3/6 months. From a valuation standpoint, BBNI traded at 0.8x 1-Year Forward P/BV as of Thursday (26/6), almost touching -1 Standard Deviation (0.77x) below the 5-year historical average. At this level, we see BBNI offering a minimum dividend yield of 7%.",
