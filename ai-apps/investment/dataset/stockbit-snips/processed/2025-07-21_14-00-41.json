      "title": "RI Targets 0% Tariff for Flagship Exports to the US",
      "content": "The Secretary of the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Susiwijono Moegiarso, stated that the government is pushing for a 0% tariff for a number of flagship export commodities to the US, such as CPO, coffee, cocoa, up to nickel. Susiwijono said that the commodities proposed to receive a 0% tariff are likely still subject to change because the final list has not been determined. In return, Susiwijono mentioned that US technology products will be exempt from the domestic content level (TKDN) rule. Susiwijono added that all US goods imported into Indonesia will not be subject to any tariffs, except for alcoholic beverages and pork. Several US goods will also be exempted from import quota regulations. Susiwijono is optimistic that a tariff agreement can be reached, especially for commodities highly needed by the US. Indonesia is the main supplier of CPO to the US, contributing 85% of total US CPO imports in 2024. Meanwhile, the US is the 4th largest destination country for Indonesian CPO exports, contributing approximately 7% of Indonesia's total CPO export volume in 2023. Previously, advisor to President Prabowo Subianto and member of the National Economic Council, Mari Elka Pangestu, told Bloomberg last week that after securing a 19% tariff, Indonesia will continue to negotiate with the US regarding sectoral tariffs, the purchase of Boeing aircraft, and critical minerals. Pangestu also explained that Indonesia will provide broader access for imports from the US that do not directly compete with Indonesian products, such as wheat and cotton.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "The success in lowering tariffs for the aforementioned commodities potentially has a positive impact on Indonesian exports, but not significantly, according to us. This is considering that the demand for Indonesia's two flagship commodities - CPO and nickel - is dominated by China (and also India for CPO). We assess that investors will still first focus - at least in the near future - on the domestic economic developments, especially the government's efforts to boost purchasing power recovery. Several recent economic indicator data - such as credit growth, car sales, and cement sales - indicate that the domestic economic conditions are still challenging.",

      "content": "1. President Prabowo Subianto inaugurated the Red and White Village Cooperative (Kopdes) program on Monday (21/7). The Minister of Cooperatives, Budi Arie Setiadi, stated that currently there are about 80,500 established Red and White Kopdes, with 103 cooperatives among them to serve as pilot projects. Initial financing for the Red and White Kopdes will be disbursed through a special KUR (People's Business Credit) via state-owned banks (Himbara) with a ceiling of up to 3 billion Rupiah per cooperative. 2. The Minister of Communication and Digital, Meutya Hafid, stated on Saturday (19/7) that there are no plans to restrict basic video call or Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Meutya's statement came after a Director at the Ministry of Communication and Digital, Denny Setiawan, mentioned that they are studying the discourse to encourage the contribution of over-the-top services related to bandwidth capacity investment. 3. The Corruption Court Judge on Friday (18/7) sentenced Thomas Lembong to 4 years and 6 months in prison in the alleged corruption case of sugar imports at the Ministry of Trade during the 2015-2016 period, even though the judge stated that Lembong did not enjoy the results of the corruption crime committed. Lembong was charged with causing state financial losses of 578.1 billion Rupiah, among others, by issuing raw crystal sugar import approval letters to 10 companies without being based on inter-ministerial coordination meetings and without recommendations from the Ministry of Industry. Lembong himself was the former Minister of Trade during the 2015-2016 period under President Joko Widodo's administration and a campaign manager for presidential candidate Anies Baswedan in the 2024 election. 4. Chinese Premier, Li Qiang, on Monday (21/7) announced the start of construction for the world's largest hydropower dam on the east bank of the Tibetan Plateau. The US$170 billion project will feature 5 hydropower stations with a total electricity capacity of 300 billion kWh per year, equivalent to the amount of electricity consumed by the UK during 2024. 5. Bisnis reports that Vale Indonesia (INCO) will reschedule the agenda for changes in company management, including the appointment of a new President Director. This follows the failure to establish the EGM on July 18, 2025, due to not meeting the attendance quorum. Currently, the position of INCO President Director is still held in an interim capacity by Bernardus Irmanto, who replaced Febriany Eddy after she was appointed as Managing Director at PT Danantara Asset Management. 6. Perusahaan Gas Negara (PGAS) announced that it will hold an EGM on August 27, 2025, with the agenda of changing the company's management. Previously, PGAS announced in early July 2025 that the term of office for Director, Harry Budi Sidharta, had ended following his appointment as a director at PT Pertamina International Shipping. 7. Bukit Uluwatu Villa (BUVA) plans to hold a rights issue of up to 4.8 billion new shares, with a maximum dilution effect of 18.9%. The exercise price and ratio have not been announced, while the funds raised are intended for business development, capital expenditure, and/or settlement of company obligations. This plan will be discussed at the EGM on July 22, 2025. Previously, BUVA had announced a rights issue plan of up to 3.6 billion new shares scheduled for the EGM on March 24, 2025, but the plan was canceled because the company still needed time to review and finalize discussions with relevant parties.",
