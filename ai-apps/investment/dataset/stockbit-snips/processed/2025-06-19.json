      "content": "1. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump told senior officials on Tuesday (June 17) that he approved a plan to strike Iran, although the plan remains on hold pending whether Iran will halt its nuclear program. When asked by reporters on Wednesday (June 18) whether he had decided to attack Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump said he had not made a final decision and again urged Iran to surrender unconditionally. On Wednesday (June 18), Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the country would not surrender and warned that U.S. military intervention would bring irreversible consequences.\n2. The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday (June 18) decided to keep the policy rate at 4.25-4.50%, in line with consensus expectations, amid uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs. The Fed still projects a 50 basis-point rate cut by the end of 2025, implying two 25-basis-point reductions. The projection is unchanged from the December 2024 and March 2025 forecasts, but the latest dot plot shows a split among Fed members.\n3. Bloomberg reported that a group of Indonesian HPAL smelters could see margin compression due to a more than three-fold increase in sulfur prices over the past year, a key raw material for producing mixed-hydroxide precipitate (MHP). Analysts at SMM Information & Technology Co. said the sulfur price surge would raise the cost of producing one ton of MHP by about USD 2,500 compared with last year. The average cost to produce one ton of MHP is now around USD 11,000, and each ton requires 12 tons of sulfur.\n4. An Indian palm-oil refiner cancelled orders for 65,000 tons of CPO for July-September 2025 shipments because of a sudden surge in the Malaysian reference price, according to four anonymous sources cited by Reuters. Nevertheless, Sunvin Group CEO Sandeep Bajoria expects Indian CPO imports to rise in the coming months, driven by low inventories after a period of weak imports. Indian CPO imports reached a six-month high in May 2025, supported by low stock levels and discounts relative to soybean and sunflower oil.\n5. Danantara COO Dony Oskaria said on Wednesday (June 18) that the company now has authority to inject capital into state-owned enterprises, eliminating the need for further state-owned enterprise capital participation (PMN). In providing capital, Danantara will assess the business plans of the targeted SOEs, including industry forecasts.\n6. The Ministry of Environment will impose administrative sanctions on PT Indonesia Morowali Industrial Park (IMIP) in Central Sulawesi because of environmental regulation violations in the industrial zone. Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said inspections found facilities not covered by the environmental impact analysis (AMDAL) and uncovered a land opening of roughly 179 hectares directly adjacent to IMIP. The IMIP industrial area spans about 2,000 hectares and currently hosts 28 operating companies with 14 under construction.",
