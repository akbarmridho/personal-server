      "content": "Bloomberg reports that PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry, which is one of the largest nickel smelter companies in Indonesia, has cut production and is on the verge of completely halting its production. This news surfaced only a few months after its parent company in China, Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., filed for bankruptcy. Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry itself is the third-largest stainless steel producer in China. Bloomberg sources stated that PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry has delayed payments to local energy suppliers and has been unable to secure nickel ore, consequently shutting down almost all of its production lines since early 2025. Bloomberg noted that PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry has a total production capacity of 1.8 million tons per year of nickel pig iron. Besides PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry, Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry is also known to own several nickel smelter businesses and stainless steel plants in Indonesia, such as PT Virtue Dragon Nickel Industry and PT Obsidian Stainless Steel. According to a Reuters report in July 2024, one of the factors driving the bankruptcy of Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry was the deteriorating performance of its joint venture in Indonesia due to declining ferronickel prices and rising material costs at the end of 2023. In the same report, Reuters also mentioned that several industry players anticipate that Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry's operations in China will be partially taken over by Chinese State-Owned Enterprises. An analyst from CRU Group consultancy, Kevin Bai, told Reuters that companies like Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry are too big to fail and the bankruptcy reorganization process is not new in China.",

      "content": "The production cut by PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry has the potential to reduce the supply of nickel pig iron from Indonesia, which could cause a global increase in the price of this commodity considering Indonesia's status as the world's largest nickel pig iron producer. The smelter capacity of PT Gunbuster Nickel Industry alone is equivalent to ~20% of Indonesia's total nickel pig iron production capacity, which reaches 9 million tons per year, based on data as of 2022. Meanwhile, the price of nickel pig iron has slowly strengthened +4.5% YTD. Today, Friday (21/2), the stock prices of nickel producers collectively strengthened, with $NCKL +7.26% and $INCO +4.45%, while $MBMA briefly rose +3.18% to the level of 390 rupiah per share before closing flat.",

In a series of protests known on social media as 'Indonesia Gelap' (Dark Indonesia), students asked President Prabowo to review the free meal program and cancel the plan to cut the budget amounting to 306.7 trillion rupiah. The 'Indonesia Gelap' protests were still ongoing on Friday (21/2) involving several civil society coalitions. Regarding the government's commitment to fiscal stability, the Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated on Thursday (20/2) that the government plans to issue jumbo bonds to fund the program of building 3 million houses per year, although she did not specify the amount. The funds raised from these bonds will later be used to increase subsidies for housing financing liquidity facilities (FLPP) on a larger scale. On the same occasion, the Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, mentioned that Bank Indonesia will purchase these bonds in the secondary market. Previously, Perry stated in December 2024 that his party would purchase Indonesian government bonds worth 150 trillion rupiah in the secondary market in 2025, of which 100 trillion rupiah would be used for debt switching of bonds with a burden sharing scheme between the government and Bank Indonesia during the Covid-19 era.",
