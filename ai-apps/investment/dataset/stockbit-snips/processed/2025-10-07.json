      "content": "Antara reported that OJK is ready to gradually approve proposals to raise the minimum free-float to up to 30%, up from the current 7.5% and a proposed increase to 10% for listed companies. BEI is studying the rule while the House Commission chair suggested a 30% target. The Director General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Eniya Listiani Dewi, said a new presidential regulation on waste-to-energy will be issued this week, requiring local governments to provide land and waste-handling fees and to guarantee feedstock for waste-to-energy plants for 30 years. Goldman Sachs raised its December 2026 gold price forecast to US$4,900 per ounce, citing strong central-bank buying and higher gold-backed ETF demand amid an expected Fed rate cut of 100 bps in mid-2026. The Malaysian Palm Oil Association said Malaysia’s palm-oil output fell 2.4% month-on-month to 1.81 million tonnes in September, a milder drop than Bloomberg’s -4.3% forecast, which could support palm-oil prices as Indian demand eases and colder weather shifts buyers to soybean oil. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources issued Ministerial Regulation No. 17/2025, cutting the validity of work plans and budgets from three years to one year to give the government tighter control over production and commodity prices; the 2025 quota remains but companies must re-apply for 2026-27. Bank Indonesia reported that adjusted M0 grew 18.6% YoY to IDR 2,152.4 trillion in September, driven by a 37% YoY rise in bank-wide current deposits and a 13.5% rise in cash in circulation. The same agency said foreign-exchange reserves fell to US$148.7 billion at end-September, the lowest in 14 months, equal to 6.2 months of import coverage, above the 3-month adequacy standard.",

      "content": "Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) plans a private placement of approximately 407.9 billion new shares to PT Danantara Asset Management at an execution price of IDR 75 per share, resulting in a total transaction value of about US$1.85 billion (≈IDR 30.5 trillion). The transaction includes: 1) a cash capital contribution of up to US$1.44 billion; and 2) conversion of a shareholder loan of US$405 million. The private placement will dilute the public-shareholding from 27.46% to about 5.03%, while Danantara’s stake will rise from 64.54% to about 93.5%. The shareholder loan from Danantara was provided in June 2025 and fully drawn by GIAA on 18 September 2025. The capital-raising plan was first disclosed in July 2025 together with the 2Q25 audit announcement. The total private-placement amount is higher than the earlier reported US$1 billion support. The proceeds will be used for: 29% working capital and operations; 37% capital increase for Citilink to fund its working capital and operations, potentially to restore Citilink’s fleet; 22% expansion of the group and Citilink fleet (the group previously announced a plan to add more than 100 aircraft by 2029); and 12% to fund Citilink’s fuel-purchase debt to Pertamina. The private placement will be discussed at the extraordinary general meeting on 12 November 2025.",
