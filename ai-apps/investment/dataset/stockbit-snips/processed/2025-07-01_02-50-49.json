      "content": "Bank Rakyat Indonesia ($BBRI) reported bank only net profit of 3.6 trillion rupiah in May 2025 (-11% YoY, -7% MoM). This result brought the bank only net profit for 5M25 to 18.6 trillion rupiah (-15% YoY), which is relatively lower compared to the consensus expectation which projected a consolidated net profit for 2025F to decline by -3% YoY.",

      "content": "Net Interest Income (NII) only slightly decreased by -1% YoY during 5M25. This result improved compared to the 3M25 realization at -5% YoY, driven by improvements in both Interest Income and Interest Expense. Both were relatively flat (-1% YoY) during 5M25, compared to the 3M25 realization which dropped around 3-4% YoY. The improved Interest Income trend is in line with credit growth which reached +5% YoY as of May 2025, compared to +4% YoY as of March 2025, although it remains below management's consolidated target for 2025 in the range of +7-9% (after adjusting bank only vs consolidated). Net Interest Margin (NIM) was still weak at 6.17% in May 2025, resulting in a NIM for 5M25 at 6.38% (vs 5M24: 6.48%), which we assess is still in line with management's consolidated target for 2025 (after adjusting bank only vs consolidated).",

      "content": "The improving NII trend was not reflected in the Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) which fell -9% YoY during 5M25, compared to -6% YoY during 3M25. This was caused by the weakening of Non-Interest Income (Non-II) in April-May 2025. Non-II in the last 2 months reached only 3.8 trillion rupiah and 3.6 trillion rupiah, smaller than the January-March 2025 levels which were around 4.1-4.2 trillion rupiah per month, due to lower profits from 'trading' and 'others'. Meanwhile, provision expenses and Cost of Credit (CoC) rose to 3.4 trillion rupiah and 3.24% in May 2025, marking a two-month consecutive increase since March 2025. This realization caused provision expenses during 5M25 to reach 17.7 trillion rupiah (-1% YoY), with CoC at 3.46%, which we assess is still above management's consolidated target for 2025 in the range of 3-3.2% (after adjusting bank only vs consolidated).",

From a valuation perspective, BBRI is trading at 1.7x 1-Year Forward P/BV as of Monday (30/6), nearly at -2 Standard Deviations (1.6x) below the 5-year historical average. We also see BBRI offering a minimum dividend yield potential of 7.5%.",
