      "title": "Car Wholesales -14% YoY in 2024, Motorcycles +1.5% YoY",
      "content": "Gaikindo noted that national car wholesales in December 2024 reached 79,806 units (-6.4% YoY, +6.6% MoM). This result caused national car wholesale sales throughout 2024 to reach 865,723 units (-14% YoY), equivalent to 102% of Gaikindo's 2024 target which had been revised down to 850,000 units. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI) noted that domestic motorcycle sales reached 403,480 units (-5.5% YoY, -21.3% MoM) in December 2024. This result brought domestic motorcycle sales throughout 2024 to 6.3 million units (+1.5% YoY), in line with AISI's 2024 target of 6.2-6.5 million units. AISI itself targets domestic motorcycle sales of 6.4-6.7 million units during 2025. Key Takeaway: Although car wholesales are projected to recover to 1 million units in 2025, we assess that investors still need to monitor the impact of car price increases due to the 12% VAT and the implementation of luxury tax surcharges on sales in the initial months of this year. Aside from taxation aspects, the launch of new models is another factor that could influence car sales this year. The presence of more affordable hybrid cars - namely in the range of 300 million rupiah - has the potential to become a positive catalyst for car sales. Meanwhile, we expect motorcycle sales performance in 2025 to still be better than car sales. This is driven by several factors, such as VAT not increasing for the majority of motorcycles sold in Indonesia and government stimulus packages being more targeted towards the lower to middle segments.",

      "title": "Retail Sales in December 2024 Expected to Increase, Coal Production Exceeds Target",
      "content": "Bank Indonesia estimates that retail sales increased by +5.1% MoM and +1% YoY in December 2024, driven by the spare parts and accessories group and the food, beverage, and tobacco group in line with increased public demand ahead of the Christmas and New Year celebrations. Meanwhile, the realization of retail sales in November 2024 grew by +0.9% YoY (vs. October 2024: +1.5% YoY), although it decreased by -0.4% MoM (vs. October 2024: -0.01% MoM) with the majority of groups experiencing contraction due to decreased public demand associated with weather factors hindering public activity. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources noted that Indonesian coal production during 2024 reached 831 million tons (+7.8 YoY), which is +17% higher than the 2024 target. Sales also rose to 811.54 million tons (+8% YoY), which is +8% higher than the 2024 target. The Brent crude oil price for the March 2025 contract strengthened by +2.22% to US$78.6 per barrel on Friday (10/1) and has the potential to post its third consecutive weekly price increase. JPMorgan associates the strengthening of Brent prices with increasing concerns over supply disruptions due to tighter sanctions on Russia and Iran amid low oil inventories, lower temperatures in the US and Europe during winter, and increased sentiment regarding China's stimulus measures. Malaysian Palm Oil Board noted that Malaysian CPO stocks fell by -6.91% MoM to 1.71 million tons in December 2024 due to floods, marking the third consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level since May 2023. Meanwhile, CPO production fell by -8.3% MoM to 1.49 million tons, marking the lowest level since March 2024. Malaysian CPO exports also dropped by -9.97% MoM to 1.34 million tons, marking the lowest level in the last 6 months. Meanwhile, Malaysian CPO consumption jumped by +53% MoM in December 2024 to 309,865 tons. The solar power plant (PLTS) company in the Philippines, Citicore Renewable Energy (PSE: CREC), announced on Friday (10/1) that Pertaminaâ€™s subsidiary, PT Pertamina Power Indonesia, will purchase a 20% stake in the company for 6.7 billion Philippine pesos or US$114.8 million. In this transaction, PT Pertamina Power Indonesia will enter through a new share issuance at a price of 3 Philippine pesos per share, lower than Citicore Renewable Energy's share price on the Philippine stock exchange as of Friday (10/1) at 3.49 Philippine pesos per share. The proceeds will be used by Citicore Renewable Energy to develop its new and renewable energy (EBT) project network, where the company targets to have 1 GW of EBT generation capacity per year. MIND ID's Portfolio and Business Development Director, Dilo Seno Widagdo, stated on Thursday (9/1) that the IPO of PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) has been included in the company's long-term plan (RJPP) for the 2026-2027 period. Dilo mentioned that Inalum's equity story needs to be fixed first before the IPO, considering the company currently as an independent entity only has an aluminum smelter in Kuala Tanjung, North Sumatra with a production capacity of 250,000 tons per year. Kontan reported that the Ministry of Public Works targets private financing support for infrastructure development over the next 5 years to reach 700 trillion rupiah, one of which is through the Public-Private Partnership (KPBU) scheme. This target is higher than the realization in the previous period at 440 trillion rupiah. The Chairman of the Central Executive Board of the Indonesian National Contractors Association, Andi Rukman Nurdin, stated that they are optimistic this target can be achieved as long as security and political stability are maintained, licensing is efficient, and the government can guarantee land acquisition. The subsidiary of First Pacific Company Ltd. owned by conglomerate Anthoni Salim, PacificLight Power Pte. Ltd., won the project to build a hydrogen power plant using combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) technology with a capacity of 600 MW in Jurong Island, Singapore. The power plant, valued at US$735 million, is scheduled to operate in January 2029.",
