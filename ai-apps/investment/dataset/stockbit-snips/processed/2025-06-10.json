      "title": "US-China Trade Agreement Framework Reached",
      "content": "The US and China governments on Tuesday (June 10) announced that the two countries have agreed on a framework for a trade agreement. The new framework, which resulted from negotiations in London, United Kingdom since the beginning of this week, will still be reviewed by the respective presidents of both countries.\n\nUS Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick said the framework will include acceleration of rare earth metal and magnet exports from China for the US automotive and defense industries. Meanwhile, the US will relax exports of several of its commodities to China, although Lutnick did not provide further details.\n\nThe framework agreed in London is a continuation of the US-China negotiations to de-escalate trade tensions. Previously, the US and China had reached a temporary agreement last month in Geneva, Switzerland, which included a reduction of import tariffs by each side by 115 percentage points for 90 days.\n\nTrade tensions between the US and China have put pressure on the Chinese economy. This is reflected in the contraction of the China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 48.3 in May 2025 – the lowest level since September 2022 – and an annual deflation of –0.1% year-on-year for four consecutive months.\n\nKey Takeaway: The continued discussion and achievement of the trade-agreement framework between the US and China shows a commitment to easing trade tensions. However, the lack of details in the announced framework and the need for each president’s approval leave uncertainty. Consequently, market reactions were muted on Wednesday (June 5) with S&P 500 futures down 0.28%, SSE up 0.52%, EuroStoxx 50 down 0.22%, and the US dollar index (DXY) flat up 0.03%.",

      "content": "1. The World Bank’s latest June 2025 outlook cuts Indonesia’s economic growth projection to 4.7% year-on-year for 2025 and 4.8% for 2026, each 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points lower than the January 2025 outlook. The World Bank also lowers the global growth projection to 2.3% for 2025 and 2.4% for 2026, also 0.4 and 0.3 percentage points lower than the January outlook. The downgrade is driven by rising trade tensions and global policy uncertainty.\n\n2. Bloomberg reports that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has become one of the candidates proposed by President Donald Trump’s advisers to head the Federal Reserve. White House officials denied the rumor without further comment. Previously, Trump said he would soon announce the Fed chief who will replace Jerome Powell after his term ends in May 2026. Earlier, former Fed governor Kevin Warsh was reported as Trump’s favorite candidate.\n\n3.
