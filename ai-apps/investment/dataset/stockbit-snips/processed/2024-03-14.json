      "title": "Car Sales February 2024 Remain Weak; ASII Market Share Increases",
      "content": "Car sales wholesale in Indonesia in February 2024 recorded 70,656 units, up 1.5% month-on-month (MoM) but down 18.8% year-on-year (YoY). The monthly growth was mainly supported by increased sales of brands under Astra International (ASII), such as Toyota and Daihatsu. Other brands like Wuling (-44.9% MoM), Hyundai (-19.2% MoM), Suzuki (-18.7% MoM) and Mitsubishi (-8.4% MoM) experienced declines.\n\nASII itself recorded wholesale sales of 41,240 units in February 2024, up 8.6% MoM but down 11.4% YoY. The relatively better result compared with the industry raised ASII’s market share to 58.4% in February 2024 (January 2024: 54.6%; February 2023: 53.5%).\n\nCumulatively for the first two months of 2024, wholesale car sales in Indonesia reached only 140,275 units, down 22.6% YoY. All brands except Wuling posted lower sales in the first two months of 2024. The result meets only 12.7% of the 2024 target set by Gaikindo at the 1.1 million-unit level. By comparison, the realizations for the first two months of 2022 and 2023 met 15.8% and 18% of the respective year’s total sales.\n\nMarketing Director of PT Toyota-Astra Motor (TAM), Anton Jimmi Suwandy, said that the weakening of car sales in early 2024 was pressured by postponed purchases from retail and fleet customers ahead of the election. In addition, the Business Association reported that the decline was also triggered by the government’s delay in extending the VAT-zero incentive for electric vehicles. As information, electric-vehicle sales contributed 3.4% of wholesale car sales in 4Q23.\n\nKey Takeaway\nAlthough sales in the coming months may recover after the election and with a rebound in EV sales, we assess that there remains a risk that the 2024 target of 1.1 million units set by Gaikindo may not be achieved.\n\nThe relatively better performance of ASII was positively received by the market, with the company’s share price rising 2.43% to IDR 5,275 per share on Thursday (14/3). Currently ASII trades at a 7.0× 1-Year Forward P/E, similar to the level during the Covid-19 pandemic. ASII also plans to propose a final dividend of IDR 421 per share, indicating a final dividend yield of about 8% on Thursday (14/3).\n\nRelated stocks: ASII, IMAS, DRMA, AUTO.",
