      "title": "The Fed Holds Rates, Awaiting Tariff Developments",
      "content": "The Fed on Wednesday (5/7) local time decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25-4.5%, in line with consensus expectations. This decision reflects a wait-and-see approach amid global uncertainty due to US tariffs, even though US President Donald Trump pressured The Fed to cut the benchmark interest rate immediately. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that it is currently too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will be the main risk going forward. Generally, the Fed noted that the US economy continues to expand with solid growth. Although initial forecasts showed US economic growth contracted by -0.3% on an annualized basis in 1Q25, the Fed attributed this to the surge in imports to anticipate tariffs. The Fed itself stated that the US labor market remains \"solid\" and inflation is still \"quite high.\" Powell also added that the Fed does not need to rush in adjusting interest rates until there is further certainty regarding the direction of trade policy from the US government. The US government indeed appears quite inconsistent with its tariff policy, causing uncertainty. For example, a few days after announcing reciprocal tariffs, Trump decided to postpone the implementation of higher tariffs for 90 days to provide time for negotiation for affected countries, except China. At the end of this week, the US government will meet with the Chinese government in Switzerland, where Bloomberg reported that the meeting between the two countries will focus on de-escalating the trade war. The US financial market tended to be muted and moved mixed on Wednesday (5/7) following the Fed's decision and comments. The three US stock indices strengthened, with S&P 500 +0.43%, Nasdaq +0.27%, and DJIA +0.70%. Meanwhile, the DXY rose +0.45%, while the 10-year US government bond yield rose +4 bps to 4.31%. In Indonesia, the IHSG weakened -1.42% on Thursday (8/5), while the 10-year Indonesian government bond yield was relatively flat at 6.86% and the Rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar strengthened +0.25% to 16,495. Key Takeaway: The market still expects a Fed rate cut of 75 bps by the end of 2025, based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool as of Thursday (8/5). Developments in trade negotiations will be a factor influencing the Fed's interest rate outlook and need to be watched by investors. Besides the planned meeting with the Chinese government this weekend, the US government will also sign a trade agreement with the UK on Thursday (8/5) local time, marking the first agreement since Trump announced reciprocal tariffs.",

      "content": "Bank Indonesia noted that foreign exchange reserves in April 2025 fell to 152.5 billion US dollars (vs. March 2025: 157.1 billion US dollars), marking the lowest level since November 2024. This decline was influenced by government external debt payments and Bank Indonesia's efforts to stabilize the Rupiah exchange rate amidst financial market uncertainty. The position of foreign exchange reserves in April 2025 is equivalent to financing 6.4 months of imports or 6.2 months of imports and government external debt payments. Head of Asia-Pacific Sovereigns at Fitch, Thomas Rookmaaker, stated on Wednesday (7/5) that Indonesia will face challenges in achieving 5% YoY economic growth in 2025 due to uncertainty from the global trade war and weakening consumer spending. Fitch itself has cut Indonesia's economic growth projection by -0.1 percentage point to +4.9% YoY in 2025, and forecasts growth in 2026 will only reach +4.7% YoY. Despite this, Rookmaaker mentioned that the slowing economic growth will not change Indonesia's rating, which currently holds a 'BBB' rating with a stable outlook from Fitch. The US Energy Information Administration noted that US crude oil stocks fell by 2 million barrels in the week ending May 2, 2025, exceeding consensus expectations which predicted a drawdown of 833,000 barrels. IDX Director, I Gede Nyoman Yetna, stated on Thursday (8/5) that there will be 2 lighthouse companies that will IPO on the Indonesian stock exchange during 2025. Yetna mentioned that these two companies operate in the energy and consumer sectors, although he did not specify their identities. The IDX itself notes that there are still 30 companies scheduled to IPO in 2025, 10 of which are companies with jumbo assets exceeding 250 billion rupiah. The IDX on Thursday (8/5) released 2 new regulations that serve as the legal basis for the implementation of liquidity provider activities to enhance stock market deepening and quality. As a note, the implementation of liquidity providers does not apply to all stocks on the IDX, where the IDX will issue a list of eligible stocks for liquidity providers every 6 months. The Director of Aspirasi Hidup Indonesia (ACES), Sugiyanto Wibawa, has submitted his resignation letter from his position on May 6, 2025. This plan will be discussed at the EGM on June 17, 2025.",
