      "title": "Trump Says Trade with China Will Be Fine After Threatening Additional Tariffs",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, on Sunday (10/13) said that US trade relations with China \"will be fine.\" This statement was a change from his statement on Friday (10/11), where he threatened to impose an additional tariff of 100 percentage point on goods originating from China, as well as control all exports of crucial US-made software to China starting November 1, 2025. Trump explained that the threat was based on China's decision to tighten restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals starting December 1, 2025, which also includes equipment used to mine and refine these commodities. China itself produces 90% of the world's processed rare earths and rare earth magnets, which are used in applications ranging from electric vehicles to military radar. Reuters reported that the export restrictions on rare earth minerals that China will implement include the obligation for exporters to obtain a license before exporting products containing more than 0.1% of China-origin rare earth or those produced using Chinese technology. Licenses will be granted to eligible parties, although the specific terms have not yet been announced. China will also reject export applications for rare earth minerals related to the defense sector, and will strictly examine applications related to advanced semiconductors and certain types of artificial intelligence. Responding to Trump's threat, the Chinese government urged both countries to immediately return to negotiations, although it stated it was ready to take retaliatory measures if the US does not revoke its policy. For context, US import tariffs for products originating from China currently stand at 30%, while China's import tariffs for US goods are 10%. Responding to developments on Friday (10/11), US stock markets corrected significantly, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling by -2.7% and -3.6% respectively. However, S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock futures strengthened by ~1% in Monday (10/13) afternoon trading, following Trump's softened comments over the weekend. Key Takeaway Reflecting on previous tariff escalations, there is a potential that the threat of tariff increases announced by Trump is an attempt by the US to negotiate with China, considering the temporary tariff postponement deadline will expire in mid-November 2025. Trump and Chinese President, Xi Jinping, are scheduled to meet at the APEC Summit 2025 in South Korea on October 31-November 1, 2025. Although Trump on Friday (10/11) mentioned that he did not see the need to meet Xi, Trump clarified that his side had not canceled the meeting schedule.",

      "content": "Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government plans to establish a financial hub in Bali to attract international banks, investment managers, and private equity firms. The government plans to model the area similarly to Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in India and the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) in the United Arab Emirates. This zone will offer tax incentives, regulatory leniency, and bureaucratic simplification. Bloomberg also mentioned that this zone will have a different legal framework, with the government reportedly considering Singapore's legal system as a reference. The policy draft is currently being compiled by the Ministry of Finance and the National Economic Council, with a target discussion date at the DPR by the end of 2025. National Economic Council Spokesperson, Jodi Mahardi, has confirmed this issue to Kontan. Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor, Juda Agung, told Kontan on Friday (10/11) that his side is optimistic that banking credit growth can meet the target range of +8-11% YoY (vs. 8M25: +7.56% YoY) because banks usually boost performance in the fourth quarter. Previously, the Ministry of Finance was also optimistic that credit growth could accelerate to +10% YoY, supported by the realization of credit disbursement from liquidity injections to State-Owned Banks (Himbara). Reuters reported that the recess allowance for each DPR member increased from 400 million rupiah to 702 million rupiah per recess period. Reuters mentioned that DPR members generally take recess about 5 times per year. DPR Deputy Chairman, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, stated that this allowance increase takes effect from October 3, 2025, and was approved by the Ministry of Finance in May 2025. Previously, the government had revoked several facilities for DPR members to quell national demonstrations at the end of August 2025.",
