      "title": "US Attacks Iran, Strait of Hormuz Potentially to be Closed",
      "content": "US President, Donald Trump, announced on Sunday (22/6) that the US military had attacked 3 Iranian nuclear facilities, marking direct US involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. This attack occurred only 3 days after the White House spokesperson mentioned that the US decision to attack Iran would only be determined in the next 2 weeks. In response to the US attack, the Iranian parliament reportedly supports a plan to close the Strait of Hormuz, which is a shipping lane for about 20% of global oil supplies daily. Nevertheless, the final decision to close the strait rests with Iran's national security council. US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said on Sunday (22/6) that he had contacted the Chinese government to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz. China is currently the largest oil importer from Iran, with imports reaching more than 1.8 million barrels per day in May 2025, according to data from ship tracking company Vortexa. As of this writing, Iran has not launched a retaliatory strike against the US. However, Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that his country is considering all options to respond to the attack. On the other hand, Trump warned that if Iran retaliates against US assets, the US will respond with greater force than the initial attack. According to a Bloomberg report, Iran currently has no alliances to fight the US, although several countries such as China and Russia have condemned the US attack on Iran. Abbas said he would meet with Russian President, Vladimir Putin, on Monday (23/6), but Bloomberg reported that military assistance from China and Russia would be difficult to provide due to the lack of formal military relations with Iran. Meanwhile, only the Houthis, a militant proxy group, have shown support for Iran, having announced threats targeting US commercial and naval vessels.",

Meanwhile, the স্টক market reacted muted by this afternoon, with Nikkei -0.13%, EUROSTOXX50 -0.44%, and S&P Futures -0.05%. Meanwhile, IHSG fell -1.74%, although this was more caused by significant declines in several large market cap stocks such as $DSSA (-5.91%), $BREN (-4.13%), and $BBRI (-1.85%). We assess that the market is still waiting to see how far Iran can respond to the US attack before prices react further, so this needs to be closely monitored by investors.",
