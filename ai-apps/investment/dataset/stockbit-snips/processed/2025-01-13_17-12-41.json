      "title": "US Labor Data Exceeds Expectations, Strengthening the Higher-for-Longer Narrative",
      "content": "The US Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded that non-farm payroll employment increased by 256,000 in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 212,000). This result significantly surpassed the consensus expectation of 160,000 and marked the highest growth since March 2024. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in the US fell to 4.1% in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 4.2%), better than the consensus expectation of 4.2%. Responding to the strong labor data, market expectations for interest rate cuts decreased. Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed cutting rates by 25 bps until June 2025 dropped to 39% as of Monday (13/1) from 44% the previous week. Meanwhile, the probability of the US interest rate remaining unchanged until June 2025 increased to 51% as of Monday (13/1) from 29% the previous week. US stock markets reacted negatively on Friday (10/1) following this data release, with S&P 500 down -1.54%, Nasdaq down -1.57%, and DJIA down -1.63%. Meanwhile, the dollar index (DXY) strengthened +0.43% to 109.65 and the 10-year US government bond yield rose +7 bps to 4.76%. The decrease in expectations for US interest rate cuts pressured the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar by -0.56% to 16,275 on Monday (13/1). Meanwhile, the IHSG fell -1.02% to 7,017 and the 10-year government bond yield rose +10 bps to 7.28%, the highest since November 2022. The Head of the Monetary Management and Asset Securitization Department of Bank Indonesia, Edi Susianto, told Bloomberg that they continue to maintain currency stability through intervention in the bond, spot, and domestic non-deliverable forward markets. Key Takeaway: This moment can be utilized by investors to lock in higher bond yields, such as PBS032 (maturing in 1.5 years) which offers a yield of 6.8% per year. Investors can also consider buying quality stocks that are correcting, such as Bank Mandiri ($BMRI) and Bank Central Asia ($BBCA). Meanwhile, the prospect of fewer US interest rate cuts potentially narrows the room for Bank Indonesia to cut rates further. Based on Bloomberg consensus, Bank Indonesia is expected to hold rates at 6% in the Board of Governors Meeting on Wednesday (15/1), although consensus still expects BI Rate cuts by 75 bps until the end of 2025. *This article was first released in Stockbit Commentary on Monday (13/1) morning.",
