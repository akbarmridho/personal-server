      "title": "AKRA: 2025 Guidance and Land Sale to ANTM",
      "content": "Management of AKR Corporindo ($AKRA) announced guidance for 2025 with the following details: Net profit around 2.4-2.6 trillion rupiah, higher by +4-18% YoY from the consensus 2024 net profit estimate in the range of 2.2-2.3 trillion rupiah. AKRA's net profit estimate for 2024 from its own consensus is lower by about 18-21% YoY from AKRA's net profit in 2023 at the level of 2.8 trillion rupiah. Net profit from the fuel trading and chemical distribution segment is targeted to grow +5-7% YoY, which is expected to be driven by fuel demand from the mining sector and new chemical sales. Land sales in JIIPE, Gresik are targeted to reach about 80-110 hectares (vs. 9M24 realization: 32 hectares), driven by sales postponed in 2024 and recognized in 2025, such as 50 hectares from Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology Co. and 30 hectares from other clients. Revenue from utilities is projected to increase significantly along with the start of operations for tenants in JIIPE, Xinyi Glass, and the normalization of PT Freeport Indonesia's smelter operations in mid-2025. Besides the 2025 guidance, AKRA also signed an agreement for land sale to Aneka Tambang ($ANTM) on December 27, 2024, although details regarding land area and transaction value were not mentioned. According to ANTM's Business Development Director, I Dewa Wirantaya, the presence of PT Freeport Indonesia's smelter in JIIPE will provide additional benefits for ANTM as the company has direct access to 99.99% pure gold raw materials. In a separate transaction, AKRA's controller, PT Arthakencana Rayatama, purchased 1.5 million AKRA shares at an average price of 1,065.4 rupiah per share on January 7 and 9, 2025. After this transaction valued at approximately 1.6 billion rupiah, PT Arthakencana Rayatama's ownership in AKRA increased from 63.611% to 63.619%. This is the first AKRA share purchase by PT Arthakencana Rayatama in 2025, since it last accumulated AKRA shares in September 2024. Key Takeaway: We assess that AKRA's performance outlook for 2025 is relatively better compared to 2024. This is based on the low-base effect of 2024 net profit, which was suppressed by: 1) weak performance of the trading and distribution segment due to coal company RKAB permit issues in 1H24 and heavy rainfall at customer mining locations in 3Q24; and 2) weak JIIPE land sales which only reached 32 hectares as of 9M24. We also assess the target of 80-110 hectares of JIIPE land sales in 2025 as achievable, considering AKRA has secured a land sale contract of 50 hectares from Sichuan Hebang Biotechnology Co. which can be recognized in 2025 and the land sale contract to ANTM. Some risks that could hinder AKRA's performance in 2025 are: 1) regulatory or weather factors disturbing the performance of the trading and distribution segment; and 2) slow progress in JIIPE land sales. As of Tuesday (1/14), AKRA shares traded at a Forward P/E Ratio valuation of around 10x, slightly above -1 Standard Deviation of the 5-year historical P/E.",
