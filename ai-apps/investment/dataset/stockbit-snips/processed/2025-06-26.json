      "title": "BBNI 5M25: Net Profit -1% YoY",
      "content": "Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI) recorded a bank-only net profit of 1.6 trillion rupiah in May 2025 (down 7% YoY, up 6% MoM). This result brings the net profit for the first five months of 2025 (5M25) to 8.5 trillion rupiah, down 1% YoY, which is lower than the consensus expectation that projected consolidated net profit for 2025F to grow 4% YoY. On a monthly basis, BBNI's net profit in May 2025 shows a post-outbreak recovery, but the recovery is relatively weaker compared with Bank Mandiri (BMRI) and Bank Central Asia (BBCA). Based on the 5M25 performance, we see an indication of a decline in BBNI's performance in 2Q25 compared with 1Q25, unless there is a significant performance improvement in June 2025 relative to the April-May 2025 level. \n\nDPK and Credit Slowdown\nAs of May 2025, BBNI's credit growth is at +7% YoY, slowing from +9% YoY in March 2025 and below the management's consolidated 2025 guidance of +8-10% YoY. We assess that this slowdown occurs alongside tight liquidity, reflected in the third-party funds (DPK) which grew only +1% YoY in May 2025, slower than the +5% YoY growth in March 2025. The loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) rose again to 94.5%, approaching the management's 2025 guidance ceiling of 95%. Limited credit growth space and tight liquidity caused net interest income (NII) to grow only +3% YoY during 5M25. Non-interest income (Non-II) grew a modest +1% YoY and operating expenses (opex) rose +6% YoY, resulting in pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) being flat year-on-year for 5M25. \n\nProvision Expense Increase\nProvision expense fell -18% MoM but still rose +5% YoY in May 2025, so over 5M25 provision expense increased +2% YoY. We highlight the increase in provision expense in April-May 2025, where the average provision expense reached about 670 billion rupiah per month, higher than the 1Q25 average of about 500 billion rupiah per month. This increase is also reflected in the cost of credit (CoC), which rose from 0.8% in 1Q25 to 0.9% during 5M25 (versus 1% in 5M24), although still below the 2025 guidance range of around 1%. \n\nKey Takeaway\nWith a high LDR that is close to the management's target ceiling, we consider liquidity easing to be the main factor to restore growth space for BBNI. The recent rise in provision expense over the last two months will also be a focus in the 2Q25 earnings call. Additionally, we see the potential for further downward revisions of the 2025F net profit consensus after recent cuts of -5% to -11% in the past three to six months. From a valuation perspective, BBNI trades at 0.8x 1-Year Forward P/BV as of Thursday (26/6), nearly touching -1 standard deviation (0.77x) below the five-year historical average. At this level, we view BBNI as offering a minimum 7% dividend yield potential.",

      "content": "1. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is considering naming a replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in September or October 2025 to weaken Powell's position. Powell's term ends in May 2026. Reuters reported that the main candidates to succeed Powell include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, former White House Council of Economic Advisers head Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Trump said on Wednesday (25/6) that Powell is \"very bad\" for not cutting rates sharply. Powell told the U.S. Senate that rate policy must be cautious because Trump's tariff plan could raise inflation.\n2. The Directorate General of Taxes explained that a planned income tax (PPh) article 22 levy on online merchants through marketplaces aims to strengthen supervision and close the shadow economy, according to Bloomberg Technoz. Director Rosmauli said the plan targets online merchants who have not fulfilled tax obligations due to lack of understanding or reluctance to face complex administrative processes. The regulation designating marketplaces as PPh article 22 collectors is still being finalized internally. Reuters previously reported that the tax rate will be 0.5% of seller sales revenue for sellers with annual turnover between 500 million and 4.8 billion rupiah, and the regulation could be announced as early as next month.\n3. Sheikh Abdulaziz Al-Thani, Chairman of Qilaa International Group, said on Thursday (26/6) that the group will make an initial investment of about 2.5 billion USD in a project to build one million affordable housing units in Indonesia, with an immediate plan to construct 50,000 apartment units.\n4. Hasinah Jusuf, Head of Legal Department of the Indonesian Life Insurance Association, said that the consolidation of state-owned insurance companies will not affect private insurance business. The statement followed Danantara BPI COO Dony Oskaria's announcement of a consolidation plan for 16 state-owned insurers, including affiliates such as AXA Mandiri, BNI Life, and BRI Life. Dony explained that the current state-owned insurers are small and not competitive enough.\n5.
