      "content": "Director of Investment Development at BPJS Ketenagakerjaan, Edwin Ridwan, told Reuters on Friday (11/4) that the institution plans to double its allocation to local equities to 20% of assets under management within three years. He noted that BPJS has been gradually increasing its equity investments, especially in large-cap stocks, since the recent decline of the IHSG. BPJS Ketenagakerjaan currently manages a social security fund of 48 billion USD, the largest institutional investor in Indonesia. Approximately 4.8 billion USD of the fund is invested in the stock market or through mutual funds. The Chinese government announced on 11 April 2025 that it will raise tariffs on all US-origin imports from 84% to 125% effective 12 April 2025. The announcement also stated that China will no longer consider further US tariff increases as the current level is economically unreasonable, and described the US tariff hikes as a \"joke.\" This came one day after the US announced that total tariffs on Chinese imports had reached 145%. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a cabinet meeting on Thursday (10/4), said he would like to reach a trade deal with China to end the trade war. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that certainty on tariff policy would emerge after the United States reaches agreements with other countries. Spot gold closed up 1.27% at $3,216.11 per troy ounce on Friday (11/4), after reaching an intraday all-time high of $3,277.23 per ounce earlier the same day. The rise was driven by global uncertainty amid the escalating US-China trade conflict. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) eased to an annual rate of 2.4% in March 2025 (down from 2.8% in February), below the consensus forecast of 2.6% and marking the lowest inflation since September 2024. On a month-over-month basis, CPI showed a deflation of 0.1% (versus a 0.2% increase in February), contrary to the consensus expectation of a 0.1% rise and representing the first monthly deflation since May 2020. Core inflation fell to 2.8% YoY and 0.1% MoM (down from 3.1% YoY and 0.2% MoM in February), also below consensus expectations of 3% YoY and 0.3% MoM, and marking the lowest core inflation year-on-year since March 2021. Minister of Cooperatives Budi Arie Setiadi said that establishing 80,000 Red-White village cooperatives will require a total funding of 400 trillion rupiah, and that these cooperatives will become suppliers for a free school-lunch program. Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs Zulkifli Hasan added that funding for the cooperatives will be arranged by the Ministry of Finance and the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry, and that the state-owned bank association (Himbara) will be involved in financing. Deputy Minister of Labor Emmanuel Ebenezer said the government is preparing regulations to guarantee that online-motorcycle-taxi and courier drivers receive an annual holiday bonus. Chairman of Shrimp Club Indonesia Andi Tamsil told Kontan that national shrimp sales have fallen by 20-30% since the United States announced a reciprocal tariff of 32% on Indonesian shrimp, noting that 90% of Indonesia's shrimp production is exported, with 70% of that going to the U.S. market.",

      "title": "WIFI plans Rights Issue of approximately Rp5.9 trillion",
      "content": "Solusi Sinergi Digital (WIFI) plans to conduct a rights issue of about 2.95 billion new shares at an execution price of 2,000 rupiah per share, with a ratio of 4:5 and a dilution effect of up to 55.56%. The potential proceeds from this plan are around 5.9 trillion rupiah, which will be used for capital contribution to its business entity, PT Integrasi Jaringan Ekosistem, for the construction of Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) networks for 4 million homepasses on Java Island. As of the end of 2024, WIFI owned 99.7% of PT Integrasi Jaringan Ekosistem. The rights will be cum-traded on the regular market and in negotiations on 11 June 2025, with the rights execution period from 17 to 23 June 2025. In a separate transaction, WIFI announced that Japanese telecommunications company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone East Corporation (NTT East) injected 4 trillion rupiah of capital into PT Integrasi Jaringan Ekosistem, giving NTT East a 49% stake in the entity. On Friday (11/4), WIFI's share price closed up 13.6% at 2,250 rupiah per share. Key Takeaway: From the two corporate actions, PT Integrasi Jaringan Ekosistem could receive a total of 9.9 trillion rupiah, allowing WIFI to pursue FTTH network development organically and through acquisitions. DealStreetAsia and Reuters reported in September 2024 that Link Net (LINK) and Indosat (ISAT) were exploring the sale of part or all of their fiber-optic businesses, with transaction values estimated at 400-500 million USD (6.6-8.3 trillion rupiah) and 1-2 billion USD (16.5-33 trillion rupiah) respectively. Overall, WIFI's profitability may decline due to the large expansion, as take-up rates are expected to be lower than the 2024 rate of over 90%, but growth potential could offset the profit pressure. If WIFI expands through acquisitions, investors should monitor the valuation of such deals.",
