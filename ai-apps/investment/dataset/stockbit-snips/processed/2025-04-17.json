This move is also supported by the relaxation from OJK, which allows issuers to conduct share buybacks without the need for General Meeting of Shareholders (RUPS) approval for six months starting from 19 March 2025. Below is a compilation of share buyback plans announced by issuers, both through RUPS approval and without RUPS:",

However, for a more significant IHSG recovery, increased confidence from foreign investors is needed so that the foreign outflow trend can reverse. Since the beginning of 2025, the IHSG has recorded a net foreign outflow of IDR 49.5 trillion as of Thursday (17/4).",

      "content": "1. Gold spot prices on the market touched an all-time high of USD 3,357 per troy ounce in intraday trading on Wednesday (16/4) before closing at USD 3,342 per troy ounce (+3.5%). Since the start of 2025, gold has risen about USD 700 per troy ounce (+27.6% YTD), supported by global uncertainty and a weakening US dollar due to trade war escalation. On Thursday (17/4) gold weakened 0.53% to USD 3,325 per troy ounce.\n2. Newcastle coal futures for April 2025 fell 1.3% to USD 94.25 per ton on Wednesday (16/4), marking the lowest level since May 2021. Coal prices have declined in recent months as demand from China fell amid oversupply, while China's monthly coal production reached an all-time high in March 2025.\n3. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday (17/4) promoted the idea of an \"Asian family\" and called for regional unity to counter US pressure on countries to limit trade with China. The idea was presented during his visit to Cambodia, concluding his Southeast Asia tour after stops in Vietnam and Malaysia.\n4. The US Census Bureau reported that US retail sales surged 1.4% month-on-month in March 2025 (vs. Feb 2025: +0.2% MoM), beating the consensus estimate of +1.3% MoM and marking the strongest growth since January 2023. The increase was driven by higher motor vehicle and parts sales (+5.3% MoM) as consumers accelerated purchases ahead of potential import tariffs. Excluding automotive, core retail sales grew 0.5% MoM in March 2025. Core retail sales, which move similarly to the consumer component of US GDP, grew 0.4% MoM (vs. Feb 2025: +1% MoM), below the consensus of +0.6% MoM.\n5. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday (16/4) that the Fed will wait for more data on the economic direction before changing interest rates. Powell warned that US President Donald Trump's tariff policy could push inflation and unemployment further from the Fed's targets. He also noted that US economic growth appears to be slowing with moderate consumer spending, and that import surges to avoid tariff implementation could weigh on US GDP estimates.\n6. The US State Department said on Wednesday (16/4) that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Indonesian Foreign Minister Sugiono to discuss tariff negotiations and deepen defence and security cooperation. The State Department also mentioned that Rubio welcomed Indonesia's efforts. Previously, in a tariff negotiation proposal, Indonesia proposed importing US goods worth USD 18-19 billion and offering Indonesian state-owned enterprises to invest in US oil, gas, and information-technology sectors.\n7. Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources on Wednesday (16/4) awarded five oil and gas blocks to winning companies as an effort to replenish hydrocarbon reserves. Reuters reported that the government plans to offer nearly 60 blocks over the coming years to reverse a decade-long production decline.\n8. The European Union regulator changed the compliance-document submission period for the anti-deforestation law to once a year, easing the previous requirement of submitting documents for each shipment. The rule change follows industry pressure and a postponement of the law's implementation to 30 December 2025. In June 2025, the EU will publish a categorisation of importing countries into high-risk, standard, or low-risk groups, with low-risk importers receiving lighter compliance requirements.",
