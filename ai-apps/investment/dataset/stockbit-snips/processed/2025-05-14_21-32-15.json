      "title": "US & China Reach Provisional Trade Deal",
      "content": "The US and China on Monday (14/5) announced a temporary trade agreement, following the meeting between the two countries in Switzerland last weekend. This marks the first meeting between the US and China since the US announced reciprocal tariffs in April 2025. Under the agreement, the US and China each reduced import tariffs by 115% for at least 90 days. China will cut import tariffs on US products from 125% to 10%, while the US lowered tariffs on Chinese products from 145% to 30%. Although not covered in the joint statement of the meeting, the US and China also reportedly reduced trade barriers imposed by each party: Reuters reported that China will ease export restrictions to the US for rare earth and magnets commodities, which are generally used in high-tech industries. Bloomberg also reported that the Chinese government has cancelled the ban on Boeing aircraft deliveries. The US announced a reduction in the 'de minimis' tariff for China from 120% to 54%. The de minimis tariff itself is an import tariff for low-value goods (maximum 800 US dollars). However, Reuters sources reported that the reduction of the de minimis tariff currently follows the general import tariff reduction to 30%. This development in the de-escalation of the trade war has improved the outlook for the US economy. Goldman Sachs on Monday (12/5) cut the US recession projection from 45% to 35%, while also revising up the US 2025 economic growth projection from 0.5% to 1%. Optimism regarding the US economy was also driven by controlled consumer price index (CPI) inflation in April 2025 at the level of 2.3% YoY (vs. Mar 2025: 2.4% YoY inflation), lower than the consensus expectation of 2.4% YoY and marking the lowest annual level since February 2021. Along with the improving economic prospects from the trade war de-escalation, there is a consensus expectation that the pace of The Fed's interest rate cuts will slow down. Based on the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of an interest rate cut of more than 50 bps until the end of 2025 was recorded at 35.9% as of Wednesday (14/5), a sharp drop from the level of 75.7% the previous week. Although a temporary agreement has been reached, US President Donald Trump said that import tariffs for China could still rise significantly if negotiations over the next 90 days fail to reach a final agreement. However, he emphasized that the US will not raise China tariffs back to the previous level of 145%. Following the US-China agreement, the US Dollar Index (DXY) strengthened by +1.09% to 101.79 on Monday (12/5). On the same day, the Nasdaq index rose +4.35%, followed by the S&P 500 (+3.26%) and DJIA (+2.81%). The strengthening of stock prices was also followed by Asian stock exchanges on Monday (12/5), with Nikkei +2.24% and Hang Seng +1.57%. Meanwhile, gold prices - which are a safe haven asset - fell -2.66% on Monday (12/5) to US$3,236.4/oz. Meanwhile, the IHSG rose +2.15% to 6,979.8 on Wednesday (14/5), driven by significant foreign inflow of 2.84 trillion rupiah. This marked the highest daily inflow since the announcement of reciprocal US tariffs.",

      "content": "Although Indonesia itself has not yet reached a trade agreement with the US, better global economic growth prospects - following improvements in US and Chinese growth due to trade war de-escalation - can bring positive impacts to Indonesia. Additionally, decreasing external risk and risk-on sentiment potentially provide stability for the rupiah exchange rate. This can give room for Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates to help boost Indonesia's economic growth.",

      "content": "MSCI announced evaluations for the Global Standard Index, Small Cap Index, and Micro Cap Index, effective for the period June 2, 2025-August 31, 2025. MTEL and MBMA enter the MSCI Indonesia Small Cap index, while HRUM, INDY, SMRA, and WIKA exit the index. Meanwhile, there are no changes in the MSCI Indonesia Global Standard index and the MSCI Indonesia Micro Cap index. The next evaluation will be announced on August 12, 2025, with the effective date of September 1, 2025. Gaikindo recorded that national car wholesales in April 2025 reached 51,205 units (+5% YoY, -28% MoM). This result made national car wholesales during 4M25 fall to 256,368 units (-3% YoY), although relatively in line with expectations as it equals 28-34% of Gaikindo's 2025 target in the range of 750,000-900,000 units (vs. 4M24: 30% of 2024 realization). The Chairman of Gaikindo, Jongkie Sugiarto, explained that the monthly decrease in car wholesales in April 2025 was triggered by fewer working days due to the long Eid al-Fitr 2025 holiday. Bank Indonesia estimates that Indonesian retail sales in April 2025 will contract by -2.2% YoY and -6.9% MoM due to demand normalization following the end of the Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr period. Meanwhile, the realization of retail sales in March 2025 grew +5.5% YoY and +13.6% MoM (vs. Feb 2025: +2% YoY, +3.3% MoM), exceeding Bank Indonesia's forecast of +0.5% YoY and +8.3% MoM. Commodity analysis firm, Kpler, noted that thermal coal exports from Indonesia dropped 20 million tons to 150 million tons during 4M25 (-12% YoY), marking the lowest export volume in the last 3 years and also the worst annual percentage decline since early 2017. The decline in Indonesian exports during 4M25 was suppressed by China and India who are currently boosting their domestic coal production. Exports to China decreased by 14 million tons or equivalent to -20% YoY during 4M25, while exports to India decreased by 6 million tons or equivalent to -15% YoY. Bloomberg reported that the Indonesian government is raising the CPO export levy from 7.5% to 10% effective May 17, 2025. This step is intended to fund the B40 program and replanting. Besides crude CPO, the government is also raising the levy for exports of other palm oil products, including crude palm olein from 6% to 9.5%, refined bleached and deodorized palm olein from 4.5% to 7.5%, and biodiesel from 3% to 4.75%. The US statistics bureau recorded that US CPI inflation in April 2025 reached 2.3% YoY and 0.2% MoM (vs. Mar 2025: 2.4% YoY inflation, -0.1% MoM deflation), respectively lower than the consensus expectation which predicted 2.4% YoY and 0.3% MoM inflation. This result marks the lowest annual CPI inflation since February 2021. Meanwhile, core inflation in April 2025 remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY (vs. Mar 2025: 2.8% YoY inflation), in line with consensus expectations while still being at the lowest level in the last 4 years. The Democratic Republic of Congo will impose tighter controls on cobalt exports when the export ban for this commodity ends, according to Patrick Luabeya, head of the strategic mineral control authority in that country. Previously, the Democratic Republic of Congo imposed a 4-month export ban starting in February 2025 to restore cobalt prices, a commodity used for electric vehicle batteries and mobile phones. In March 2025, the DRC government stated plans to implement cobalt export quotas and would partner with Indonesia to manage cobalt supply and prices in the global market. Shareholders of SINI, PT Autum Prima Indonesia, sold approximately 24.1 million SINI shares at a price of 1,000 rupiah per share on May 9, 2025. The total transaction value reached approximately 24 billion rupiah and was intended to increase the number of shares circulating among the public. After this transaction, the ownership of PT Autum Prima Indonesia in SINI decreased from 35% to 30%. Intanwijaya Internasional (INCI) will distribute a dividend for the 2024 fiscal year of approximately 7.3 billion rupiah or 35 rupiah per share, equivalent to a 28% dividend payout ratio and indicating a dividend yield of 5.8% as of Wednesday (14/5). The cum date in the regular and negotiation market is May 30, 2025, while payment is on July 17, 2025.",
