      "content": "In earnings call on Monday (21/4), TLKM management targeted revenue growth of low-single digit in 2025 (vs. 2024 realization: +0.5% YoY), with an EBITDA margin of around 50-52% (vs. 2024 realization: 50%) and capex-to-sales of about 17-19% (vs. 2024 realization: 16.3%). For context, Indosat (ISAT) targeted better revenue growth than the market during 2025 (vs. 2024 realization: +9% YoY), an increased EBITDA margin (vs. 2024 realization: 47%), and capex of 13 trillion rupiah (vs. 2024 realization: 9.9 trillion rupiah). We assess TLKM's target for 2025 as relatively realistic amidst current industry trends and public purchasing power. The targets set by TLKM and ISAT align with consensus estimates forecasting low-single digit revenue growth (2025F TLKM: +3.8% YoY, 2025F ISAT: +5% YoY) and improvement in EBITDA margin (2025F TLKM: 52%, 2025F ISAT: 48%) for both companies. Using the guidance provided by TLKM and ISAT, we assess that telecommunication operator players will tend to wait-and-see in 2025 and await the impact of the EXCL-FREN merger on industry competition before making more massive adjustments to growth strategies. Nevertheless, we see the quarterly ARPU growth of TLKM and the current operator consolidation as signs that this industry is moving toward a more positive direction (worst is over).",

      "content": "1. The US Dollar Index (DXY) weakened to its lowest point since March 2022 at 97.93 on Monday (21/4), following rumors that US President Donald Trump plans to fire the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell. This issue surfaced after the Director of the US National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, said on Friday (18/4) that Trump is studying whether he has the authority to fire Powell. Hassett's statement came a day after Trump publicly criticized Powell for not moving fast enough to cut interest rates. 2. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said on Friday (18/4) that Indonesia and the US plan to complete trade and investment partnership negotiations within 60 days. Airlangga mentioned that the Indonesian government expects its 20 main exports to the US - including textiles, furniture, and shrimp - to be given balanced tariffs, no higher than those applied to competing countries. In return, Indonesia offers cooperation in access to critical minerals and deregulation of imports of horticultural products from the US. Indonesia has also asked the US to deepen cooperation in trade, investment, energy, finance, defense, and education. The Indonesian delegation will meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week. 3. China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, said on Monday (21/4) that China and Indonesia must oppose all forms of unilateralism and trade protectionism. Wang also stated that China and Indonesia must jointly accelerate regional economic integration and maintain the stability of industrial and supply chains. Wang's statement came after the Chinese government met with the Indonesian government in Beijing on Monday (21/4). 4. The Chinese government on Monday (21/4) accused the US government of misusing tariffs and warned other countries against reaching broader economic deals with the US. China's Ministry of Commerce stated that it will oppose any party reaching an agreement that sacrifices China's interests. If this occurs, China threatens to take retaliatory measures firmly. 5. BPS recorded that Indonesia's trade balance surplus reached 4.33 billion US dollars in March 2025 (vs. Mar 2024: 4.58 billion US dollars, Feb 2025: 3.12 billion US dollars), exceeding consensus expectations of 2.64 billion US dollars. This result was supported by export growth of +3.16% YoY (vs. consensus: -3.4% YoY), while imports rose +5.34% YoY (vs. consensus: +6.6% YoY). 6. Bank Indonesia Senior Deputy Governor, Destry Damayanti, said on Monday (21/4) that BI is open to cooperating with any country - including the US - in the use of QRIS, if both parties are ready. Destry's statement came after QRIS was included in the list of US trade barriers in Indonesia, released by the US Trade Representative's Office. Besides QRIS, the US also highlighted the implementation of the National Payment Gateway (GPN) as a US trade barrier in Indonesia. 7. South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that the consortium led by LG withdrew from a 7.7 billion dollar electric vehicle battery supply chain project in Indonesia, where the consortium partnered with the Indonesian government and State-Owned Enterprises. Yonhap sources stated that the move was taken amid slowing global electric vehicle demand. Nevertheless, LG continues existing electric vehicle battery projects in Indonesia, such as the battery plant project with Hyundai Motor Group. 8. Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88, according to a statement from Vatican authorities on Monday (21/4).",

      "title": "Telkom Indonesia Posted Q4 2024 Net Profit of IDR 5.9 Trillion (+18% YoY, +1% QoQ), Full Year 2024 Net Profit at IDR 23.6 Trillion (-4% YoY)",
      "content": "Telkom Indonesia ($TLKM) recorded a net profit of 5.9 trillion rupiah in 4Q24 (+18% YoY, +1% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 2024 to 23.6 trillion rupiah (-4% YoY), in line with expectations (99% of the consensus 2024F estimate). Operationally, TLKM recorded 159.4 million mobile customers in 4Q24 (+0% YoY, +1% QoQ), with an average revenue per user (ARPU) of 44 thousand rupiah (-5% YoY, +2% QoQ). Although still down annually, this realization marks the first quarterly growth in mobile segment ARPU since experiencing a declining trend from its peak level in 2Q23 at 49.7 thousand rupiah. This quarterly ARPU increase is a positive signal for the telecommunication operator industry amid intense price war issues between operators throughout 2024. Meanwhile, broadband customers increased in 4Q24 (+8% YoY, +1% QoQ), although ARPU dropped to 233 thousand rupiah (-6% YoY, -1% QoQ). This ARPU decline in the broadband segment is likely caused by fixed mobile convergence (FMC) strategy and/or tight price competition in the fixed broadband segment. Despite improving quarterly operational metrics, TLKM's operating profit in 4Q24 fell to 10 trillion rupiah (+1% YoY, -6% QoQ), mainly due to an increase in marketing costs to 1.3 trillion rupiah (+38% YoY, +36% QoQ) resulting from a customer loyalty program. This result caused TLKM's operating profit for 2024 to drop to 42.4 trillion rupiah (-6% YoY), slightly below expectations (97% of the consensus 2024F estimate). The ratio of marketing costs to total revenue was at 2.6% during 2024, still in line with the historical average in the range of 2-3%. TLKM also booked a gain from changes in fair value of investments amounting to 664 billion rupiah in 4Q24 (vs. 3Q24: gain 381 billion rupiah; 4Q23: loss 566 billion rupiah), bringing the total gain for 2024 from this item to 188 billion rupiah (vs. 2023: loss 748 billion rupiah). Assuming a dividend payout ratio of around 70-80% - referring to projections from the company circulating in various media - TLKM could potentially distribute a dividend for the 2024 fiscal year of around 167-191 rupiah per share, equivalent to a dividend yield of about 6.5-7.4% based on the share price on Monday (21/4) at 2,570 rupiah per share. TLKM plans to hold its AGM on May 27, 2025, to determine the dividend distribution for the 2024 fiscal year.",
