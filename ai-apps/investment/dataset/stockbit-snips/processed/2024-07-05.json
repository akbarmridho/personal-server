      "title": "Kemendag Proposes Up to 200% Import Duty for Chinese Ceramics",
      "content": "The Indonesian Ministry of Trade’s Anti‑Dumping Committee (KADI) on 2 July 2024 recommended an anti‑dumping import duty (BMAD) ranging from 100.12% to 199.88% for ceramic imports from China. The recommendation was issued after KADI concluded a causal link between the loss of the domestic ceramic industry and dumping imports from China. Currently, imported ceramics are subject to a Safeguard Import Duty (BMTP) of 13% under Minister of Finance Regulation No. 156/PMK.010/2021, effective until November 2024. Despite this, domestically produced ceramics remain uncompetitive with Chinese imports. According to KADI, Chinese ceramic imports accounted for 41% of national consumption in the July 2021–June 2022 period, while 49% came from domestic producers and 10% from other countries. \n\nChairman of the Indonesian Ceramic Association (Asaki), Edy Suyanto, told Investor Daily that KADI’s findings reflect government fairness and support for the sustainability of the national ceramic industry. He explained that the domestic ceramic sector has been battered by imports, with factory utilization falling from 75% in 2022 to 63% in the first half of 2024. \n\nThe exact date when the BMAD regulation will be implemented remains unknown. On Friday 5 July, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan said the government will continue investigating a broader range of goods from various countries that may be subject to BMAD. In addition to ceramics, the ministry will monitor imports of textiles, apparel, footwear, cosmetics, and electronics. \n\nEdy added that importers are likely to use the gap between the KADI report and the BMAD implementation to import large volumes to avoid the duty. \n\nKey Takeaway: We assess that the BMAD policy will benefit domestic ceramic producers such as Arwana Citramulia (ARNA) and Cahayaputra Asa Keramik (CAKK) because Chinese ceramic prices will rise with the duty, making local ceramics more competitive, potentially boosting plant utilization and profitability. However, if importers stockpile Chinese ceramics during the grace period, a lagging effect could delay the expected sales increase for the domestic industry.",
