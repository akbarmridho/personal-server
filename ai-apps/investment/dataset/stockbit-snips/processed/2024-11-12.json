      "title": "Menanti Formula Kenaikan UMP 2025",
      "content": "The government will announce the formula for determining the provincial minimum wage (UMP) for 2025 in the near future. The formula will replace the one set in Government Regulation No. 51/2023, which was annulled by the Constitutional Court last week following the removal of the labor clusters from the Omnibus Law. Vice President of the Confederation of Indonesian Workers' Unions, Kahar S. Cahyono, said his organization met with the House of Representatives and the government on Wednesday (6/11). In that meeting, Kahar said the Ministry of Manpower proposed that the alpha variable in the UMP formula be divided by industry type, with the alpha variable for labor-intensive industries ranging from 0.2-0.5 and for capital-intensive industries around 0.2-0.8. The Ministry’s proposal is lower than the Confederation’s demand for an alpha of about 1-1.2 to preserve purchasing power in 2025. The alpha variable is an index representing the contribution of labor to provincial or city/district economic growth. In Government Regulation No. 51/2023, alpha was set around 0.1-0.3, which is multiplied by economic growth and then added to the inflation rate to produce the UMP increase rate. Another proposal from the President of the All-Indonesia Workers’ Union, Mirah Sumirat, suggested that the 2025 UMP formula should also consider projected inflation and economic growth, and include 64 items of a decent-living component. In addition to changing the UMP formula, the government will reinstate sectoral minimum wages (UMS) that were removed by the Omnibus Law. The UMP setting period ends on 21 November 2024, with the latest announcement of city/district minimum wages due by 30 November 2024. Labor market analyst Timboel Siregar said the government should postpone the 2025 UMP deadline so that the Regional Wage Board discussion is not rushed.",

He also said the government’s proposal to impose import duties on milk would be counter-productive because it would raise the retail price of milk at a time when consumer purchasing power is already challenged. Deputy Minister of Cooperatives, Ferry Juliantono, said imported milk is cheaper by about 1,000-2,000 rupiah per litre. To encourage domestic milk consumption, the ministry proposes incentives for local farmers or a review of the potential imposition of import duties on milk.",
