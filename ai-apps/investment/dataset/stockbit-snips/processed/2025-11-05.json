      "title": "BPS recorded that Indonesia's economic growth in 3Q25 slowed to +5.04% YoY",
      "content": "BPS noted that Indonesia's economic growth in 3Q25 slowed to +5.04% YoY (vs. 2Q25: +5.12% YoY), relatively in line with consensus expectations at +5% YoY. Quarterly, the Indonesian economy grew +1.43% QoQ in 3Q25 (vs. 3Q24: +1.5% QoQ). This result brings Indonesia's economic growth over 9M25 to reach +5.01% YoY. From the expenditure side, Indonesia's economic growth in 3Q25 was suppressed by weakening household consumption - the largest contributor - which only recorded growth of +4.89% YoY (vs. 2Q25: +4.97% YoY), marking the weakest growth since 4Q23. This result was influenced by fewer public holidays and national demonstrations that took place at the end of August 2025. Meanwhile, economic growth in 3Q25 was supported by an increase in net exports - amidst slowing imports - and growth in government consumption. Indonesian exports in 3Q25 grew solidly by +9.91% YoY even though the US began imposing reciprocal tariffs in August 2025. Meanwhile, government consumption grew +5.49% YoY after contracting -0.33% YoY in the previous quarter, following the end of budget efficiency and the release of a stimulus package worth ~24.4 trillion rupiah for the June-July 2025 period. To further boost economic growth in 4Q25, the government announced 2 different stimulus packages in September and October 2025, valued at ~16.2 trillion rupiah and ~30 trillion rupiah, respectively. Slower economic growth in 3Q25 was also contributed by decelerating Gross Fixed Asset Formation (GFCF) to +5.04% YoY (vs. 2Q25: +6.99%) due to geopolitical and global trade tensions. Based on the business field, mining (-1.98% YoY) was the only industry experiencing contraction, driven by weakening coal demand in the global market and declining copper production in the Papua region. Meanwhile, the education services industry (+10.59% YoY), other services (+9.92% YoY), and corporate services (+9.94% YoY) recorded the highest growth following the start of the new academic year, an increase in the number of foreign tourists, and increased revenue from equipment rental services and professional services. Spatially, Sulawesi (+5.84% YoY) and Java (+5.17% YoY) recorded the highest economic growth in 3Q25, while Sumatra (+4.9% YoY), Kalimantan (+4.7% YoY), Bali and Nusra (+4.71% YoY), and Maluku and Papua (+2.68% YoY) recorded lower growth compared to national economic growth.",
