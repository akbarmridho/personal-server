This new regulation does not apply to the oil and gas sector, where the implementation of DHE SDA placement for this sector will still refer to Government Regulation No. 36/2023. With this rule revision, President Prabowo predicts that the foreign exchange earnings kept in domestic banks could increase by 80 billion US dollars in 2025. The new regulation also provides room for exporters to use the DHE placed in a special account for several purposes, which are: 1) exchange to Rupiah in the same bank for business operations; 2) payment of tax obligations, state revenues, and other obligations to the government; 3) payment of dividends in foreign currency; 4) payment for the procurement of goods and services that are not yet available domestically; and 5) repayment of loans for capital goods procurement in foreign currency.",
