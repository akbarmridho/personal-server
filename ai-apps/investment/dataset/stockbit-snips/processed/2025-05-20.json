      "content": "The Indonesian rupiah against the US dollar strengthened by 0.1% to 16,415 today, Tuesday (20/5), following news that the 2025 state budget (APBN) posted a surplus in the first four months after a deficit in the first quarter. The rally has lifted the rupiah by 2.8% since its low of 16,870 on 24 April 2025.\n\nThe recent appreciation coincides with improving global sentiment from the de-escalation of the US-China trade dispute and a weakening US dollar. Global sentiment also lifted the Jakarta Composite Index (IHSG) by 18.3% as of 20 May 2025 from its low of 5,996 on 8 April 2025, driven by a return of foreign inflows.\n\nBloomberg reported that analysts expect the rupiah’s uptrend to continue, mainly due to a weaker dollar and more prudent fiscal management in Indonesia. The dollar’s weakness is pressured by soft US economic data and investor concerns over US government debt, prompting portfolio diversification away from US markets.\n\nTD Securities projects the rupiah could appreciate more than 4% in 4Q25 versus the Friday (16/5) close at 16,440. Citigroup Global Markets forecasts the rate to reach around 16,000 in 2026. ING Financial Markets is the most bullish, expecting the rupiah to reach 15,200 by the end of 2025.\n\nA stronger rupiah gives Bank Indonesia more room to cut the BI Rate. Reuters consensus expects a 25-basis-point cut to 5.5% at the Board of Governors meeting on Wednesday (21/5) and another 25-basis-point cut to 5.25% by the end of 3Q25.",
