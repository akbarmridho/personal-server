      "content": "1. The Fed on Wednesday (30/7) local time decided to keep the US interest rate at 4.25-4.5%, in line with consensus expectations. This decision was made by considering that the ongoing trade war could hinder the progress of inflation reduction towards the 2% target. The Fed also stated that the US unemployment rate remains low, while inflation remains somewhat high. Nevertheless, The Fed observed that the latest indicators show a moderation of US economic activity during 1H25, differentiating from the previous assessment that the US economy grew at a solid rate. 2. Bloomberg reported that Bank Indonesia has intervened in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the rupiah exchange rate. The Head of the Monetary Management and Securities Assets Department of Bank Indonesia, Erwin Hutapea, told Bloomberg on Thursday (31/7) that they intervened in the domestic market through spot purchases, non-deliverable forwards (NDF), government bonds, as well as offshore NDFs. Erwin's statement came after the rupiah depreciated -0.4% against the US dollar to the level of 16,460 in early trading on Thursday (31/7) - marking its lowest level in the last 1 month - following the hawkish tone from the Fed by maintaining US interest rates. 3. US President, Donald Trump, on Wednesday (30/7) local time stipulated that refined copper products will be exempted from the 50% tariff for copper commodities. Following this decision, copper futures prices on the Comex exchange plummeted more than -22% intraday on the same day, marking the deepest drop in the history of trading for that contract. The fall in copper futures prices on the Comex exchange was driven by concerns over stock build-up, after US copper imports surged in recent months anticipating the tariff plan from Trump. 4. The Head of the Center for Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis (PPATK) Public Relations Bureau, Natsir Kongah, said on Wednesday (30/7) that some of the tens of millions of dormant or inactive accounts that were previously blocked have now been reopened. Kompas reported that as of May 2025, PPATK recorded that a total of 31 million customer accounts had been blocked due to being inactive, with a total fund value reaching 6 trillion rupiah. PPATK's decision to reopen the block on some dormant accounts occurred following the summons of the Head of PPATK, Ivan Yustiavandana, and the Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, by President Prabowo Subianto on the same day. 5. Summarecon Agung ($SMRA) announced that its 1H25 financial statements will be audited due to corporate actions planned by the company. Thus, SMRA will submit its 1H25 financial statements no later than September 30, 2025. 6. The Director of Cikarang Listrindo ($POWR), Yudho Pratikto, purchased approximately 12.8 million POWR shares at an average price of 685 rupiah per share on July 25, 2025. The total transaction value reached circa 8.7 billion rupiah. After this transaction, Yudho Pratikto's direct ownership portion in POWR increased from approximately 0.05% to approximately 0.13%.",

This result brings the net profit for 1H25 to 26.3 trillion rupiah (-12% YoY), below expectations (45% of 2025F consensus estimate vs. the average of the last 2 years: 49% annual realization). The year-on-year decline in net profit in 2Q25 was primarily caused by an increase in provisioning expenses (+41% YoY), although Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) grew +8% YoY. The improvement in PPOP in 2Q25 resulted in PPOP for 1H25 still showing a slight growth of +2% YoY, but the increase in provisioning expenses by +26% YoY in 1H25 caused the net profit to fall.",

      "title": "BBRI: NII Trend Improving, Micro Segment Asset Quality Still Deteriorating",
      "content": "As we wrote in the bank-only performance [BBRI 5M25], the Net Interest Income (NII) trend has improved recently. NII in 2Q25 grew +8% YoY, driving NII for 1H25 up +3% YoY. The increase in NII in 2Q25 was driven by loan growth and CASA which increased to +6% YoY and +11% YoY as of June 2025, respectively, compared to +5% YoY and +7% YoY as of March 2025. The improvement in NII was compensated by the weakening of Non-Interest Income (Non-II) which decreased -3% YoY in 2Q25, so Non-II grew +6% YoY during 1H25. BBRI management attributed the decline in Non-II during 2Q25 to accounting changes related to insurance premium income (IFRS 17), where income is now allocated according to the insurance coverage period, compared to being booked all at once upfront when the premium was paid. Asset Quality: 'Micro' Segment Still Deteriorating. Although gross NPL remained stable at 3% in 2Q25 compared to 1Q25, there are segmental differences in the trend. The 'Micro' segment experienced an NPL increase to 3.86% as of June 2025, compared to 3.36% as of March 2025. Meanwhile, the 'Corporate' segment NPL improved to 1.61% as of June 2025 from 2.36% as of March 2025. With this dynamic, loan growth for the 'Corporate' segment increased as of June 2025 to +16% YoY (vs. March 2025: +13% YoY). The growth of the 'Micro' segment is still constrained at the +1.6% YoY level as of June 2025 (vs. March 2025: +1.5% YoY) in line with the ongoing restructuring process of this segment. Key Takeaway In line with the expectations of other large banks, BBRI estimates that the acceleration of government spending and the downward trend in interest rates have the potential to boost economic growth in 2H25, which will have a positive impact on credit demand and banking liquidity. However, the company will remain cautious, as management sees credit growth until year-end potentially only reaching the lower bound of the 2025 guidance ranging from +7-9% YoY. The realization of Cost of Credit (CoC) until the end of the year is also expected to be at the upper bound or slightly exceed the 2025 guidance which is in the range of 3-3.2%. Regarding the Koperasi Desa Merah Putih, BBRI stated that liquidity for financing the program will be provided by the Ministry of Finance, although the company did not specify further details.",

This result brings the net profit for 1H25 to 2.16 trillion rupiah (-13% YoY), equivalent to 59% of the 2025F consensus estimate. In general, the year-on-year decline in net profit was caused by a decrease in revenue and an increase in financing costs. Nevertheless, the level of revenue decline improved, contracting only -3% YoY in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: -6% YoY). The improving revenue trend is also reflected in UNVR's market share movements in 2Q25, both in volume (27.3% vs. 1Q25: 26.9%) and value (33.1% vs. 1Q25: 32.8%). Along with the release of 2Q25 performance, UNVR announced a share buyback plan of up to 2 trillion rupiah in the period of July 31-October 30, 2025, with a maximum buyback price of 1,700 rupiah per share.",

The surge in year-on-year net profit in both 2Q25 and 1H25 was primarily due to a reversal of foreign exchange loss/gain. Operationally, operating profit was -4%/+1% YoY in 2Q25/1H25. The realization of operating profit during 1H25 was in line with expectations (47% of 2025F consensus estimate). Meanwhile, Indofood CBP ($ICBP) booked a net profit of 2.88 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (+143% YoY, +8% QoQ), bringing the net profit for 1H25 to 5.54 trillion rupiah (+56% YoY). The annual increase in net profit was mainly driven by improvements in the foreign exchange loss/gain position. Operationally, ICBP's EBIT in 2Q25/1H25 decreased by -16%/-5% YoY, primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin following an increase in raw material prices. The realization of ICBP EBIT during 1H25 was slightly below expectations (49% of 2025F consensus estimate vs. the average of the last 2 years: 52% annual realization).",

The decline in the growth level in 2Q25 was pressured by lower revenue growth at +3% YoY in 2Q25 (vs. 1Q25: +6% YoY) and an operating profit margin that fell to 12.9% (vs. 1Q25: 15.6%, 2Q24: 13.5%) due to an increase in sales costs by +13% YoY, especially in advertising and promotion costs.
