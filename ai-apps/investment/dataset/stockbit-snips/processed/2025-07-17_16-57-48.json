      "content": "Indonesia and the European Union announced late last weekend that both parties have reached a political agreement regarding a free trade agreement called the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). The Minister of Investment, Rosan Roeslani, stated on Monday (14/7) that the agreement, which has been negotiated for 10 years, will be signed in September 2025. As of now, the details of the CEPA agreement have not yet been announced. However, the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, said in June 2025 that the agreement would result in Indonesia obtaining zero tariffs for almost 80% of its export products to the European Union, along with the elimination of other non-tariff barriers. Airlangga mentioned that this agreement would give Indonesian export commodities a level playing field with other Southeast Asian countries—such as Thailand and Vietnam—which have historically been charged lower tariffs by the European Union. Airlangga explained that Indonesian export products have generally been subject to tariffs of around 10-20% by the European Union. According to media reports, Indonesian commodities subject to EU tariffs include palm oil derivative products with tariffs of about 5-12.8%, biodiesel (palm oil-based) around 8-18%, textiles around 8-12%, and seafood products about 16-20%. The Director General at the Ministry of Trade, Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, said in June 2025 that the European Union has committed to providing market access for priority Indonesian products, such as palm oil, textiles, footwear, and seafood. In return, Indonesia has pledged to increase market access for agricultural and manufacturing products from the European Union. Based on Djatmiko's presentation slide, the main benefits of this agreement for Indonesia include increased Foreign Direct Investment from the European Union in sectors such as renewable energy, semiconductors, and mineral derivatives. In June 2025, Reuters reported that the CEPA agreement would increase Indonesian exports to the European Union by +5.4%, based on internal government analysis. However, Airlangga stated that this projection is a conservative estimate and he targets Indonesian commodity export volume to the European Union to increase by up to +50% within about 3-4 years after the agreement is implemented. The European Union is the 5th largest trading partner for Indonesia, with total trade between the two reaching 27.3 billion euros in 2024, according to EU data. Of this amount, Indonesia exported commodities worth 17.5 billion euros to the European Union in 2024, while the European Union exported commodities worth 9.7 billion euros to Indonesia. The free trade agreement between Indonesia and the European Union comes after the EU classified Indonesia as a country in the 'standard risk' category under its anti-deforestation law, which means Indonesian exporters will be spared from the strictest compliance checks for goods exported to Europe starting December 30, 2025. This agreement also comes amid trade tensions between Europe and the US, where the European Union is considering imposing tariffs on US products following threats by President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the European Union starting August 1, 2025.",

      "title": "Key Takeaway",
      "content": "Generally, we assess that tariff and/or trade policies from President Donald Trump can increase the urgency for Indonesia and the European Union to secure this agreement as an alternative market for both parties. Sectorally, we see that the significance of this trade agreement for Indonesia lies in the textile and textile product (TPT) sector. According to estimates from the Indonesian Textile Association, TPT exports to Europe can grow up to 2-3 times in the next 5 years after this agreement is reached. This increase is equivalent to about 15-30% of Indonesia's total annual TPT exports, so this significant potential can revive the textile sector which employs many workers in Indonesia. Meanwhile, for palm oil and seafood products, the increase in demand contribution to total exports is relatively limited, considering the European Union is not the main market for these products exported from Indonesia.",

      "content": "US President Donald Trump, on Wednesday (16/7), denied reports that he was trying to remove the Fed Chair, Jerome Powell. Trump added that although the possibility of removing Powell is very small, Powell could resign if involved in a fraud case. Trump's statement indicates that the potential dismissal of Powell remains open if there is a strong reason. Trump and his allies have recently criticized Powell over the renovation costs of the Fed's headquarters in Washington, in addition to the Fed's decision to maintain interest rates. Bloomberg reported that Trump's statement emerged after a White House official and several members of the US Congress who met with Trump on Tuesday (15/7) said they expected Trump to take action against Powell. Advisor to President Prabowo Subianto and member of the National Economic Council, Mari Elka Pangestu, told Bloomberg that Indonesia will continue to negotiate with the US regarding sectoral tariffs, the purchase of Boeing aircraft, and critical minerals after securing a 19% tariff rate. Pangestu explained that Indonesia will grant the US wider access for exports that do not directly compete with Indonesian products, such as wheat and cotton. Pangestu added that she expects the impact of this access to be moderate on Indonesia's overall imports. Pangestu mentioned that the tariff agreement with the US will benefit Indonesia with lower tariffs for key exports to the US, such as palm oil. Bloomberg reported that the Indian government is targeting lower tariffs than Indonesia and Vietnam in trade agreements with the US. Indonesia and Vietnam are currently subject to tariffs of 19% and 20% respectively by the US. The head economist at the State Bank of India, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, said that India hopes the US can lower tariffs for their country to below 10%. Previously, President Donald Trump said that tariffs for India would not be very different from those imposed by the US on Indonesia. Deputy Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Todotua Pasaribu, stated on Wednesday (16/7) that Indonesia's investment realization in 2Q25 reached 475 trillion rupiah (+10.9% YoY, +2.2% QoQ). This result brought the total investment realization for 1H25 to 940 trillion rupiah (+13.3% YoY), equivalent to ~49.5% of the 2025 target of 1,900 trillion rupiah.",
