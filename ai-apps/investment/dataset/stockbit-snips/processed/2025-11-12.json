      "content": "Governor of Bank Indonesia, Perry Warjiyo, stated on Wednesday (11/12) that Bank Indonesia projects Indonesia's economic growth in 2026 to reach +5.3% YoY, lower than the 2026 State Budget target of +5.4% YoY. Nevertheless, Perry mentioned that economic growth in 2026 could still reach +5.4% YoY if the government accelerates fiscal spending. For 2025, Bank Indonesia forecasts economic growth to be at +5.1% YoY, unchanged from the previous projection. Meanwhile, credit growth in 2026 is projected to be in the range of +8-12% YoY, compared to the 2025 target range of +8-11% YoY. Regarding the exchange rate, Bank Indonesia projects the average rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar will be at the level of 16,440 in 2025 and 16,430 in 2026. Bank Indonesia also projects average inflation to reach 2.01% YoY in 2025 and 2.62% YoY in 2026. Chairman of Gapki, Eddy Martono, told Bloomberg that palm oil prices could reach 5,000 Ringgit per ton in 1H26 if the government continues the discourse on implementing a 50% biodiesel mixture or B50. The implementation of B50 can depress Indonesian palm oil exports. Secretary General of Gapki, M. Hadi Sugeng Wahyudiono, mentioned that the implementation of B50 has the potential to cut Indonesia's total palm oil exports to 26 million tons in 2026, down from this year's estimate of 31 million tons. Previously, the Minister of EMR, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in October 2025 that the government plans to implement B50 in 2H26 and is considering the option of implementing a domestic market obligation (DMO) on palm oil to maintain the supply for the B50 program.",
