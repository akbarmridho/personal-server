      "title": "Danantara Officially Launched",
      "content": "President Prabowo Subianto officially launched the Danantara Investment Management Agency today, Monday (24/2), following the amendment to the SOE Law which was ratified earlier this month. The agency will be led by the Minister of Investment and Downstreaming, Rosan Perkasa Roeslani, as CEO. Meanwhile, the positions of CIO and COO are filled by Pandu Sjahrir and Deputy Minister of SOEs, Dony Oskaria, respectively. Danantara is the second sovereign wealth fund owned by Indonesia after the Indonesia Investment Authority, with both operating separately. Bloomberg previously reported that Danantara is President Prabowo's initiative to mobilize more funding for his strategic projects without inflating the State Budget. Dony stated on Monday (24/2) that Danantara will manage all State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) by the end of March 2025. Several national media outlets mentioned that there are 7 SOEs that will be managed by Danantara in the initial phase of operation, namely Bank Mandiri ($BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia ($BBRI), Bank Negara Indonesia ($BBNI), Telkom Indonesia ($TLKM), PT PLN, PT Pertamina, and Mining Industry Indonesia (MIND ID). Previously, President Prabowo stated on Thursday (13/2) that Danantara would have managed assets exceeding 900 billion US dollars, based on initial evaluation. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that based on the consolidated financial statements as of the end of 2023, Indonesia has more than 60 SOEs, with total consolidated assets equivalent to 638 billion US dollars, total net profit around 20 billion US dollars, and total dividends to the state around 5 billion US dollars. President Prabowo mentioned that the government will channel an amount of 20 billion US dollars from budget efficiency savings to Danantara as initial phase funding. This initial funding is intended to finance 20 high-impact national projects across various industries, ranging from downstream nickel and other minerals to artificial intelligence, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, food production, aquaculture, and renewable energy. Previously, the minimum initial capital for Danantara was planned to reach 1,000 trillion rupiah or approximately 60 billion US dollars. President Prabowo also promised transparency for Danantara, stating that the agency can be audited at any time by anyone. Meanwhile, Rosan claimed that all parties can audit Danantara, including the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) and the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Previously, several parties expressed concern over the ratification of Danantara due to its immunity from audits by the BPK and KPK, unless there was a request from the DPR. Key Takeaway We assess that the establishment of Danantara has the potential to deliver positive impacts from several aspects, such as: 1) expansion of government funding sources (Danantara can issue bonds, obtain loans, and partner with other countries' sovereign wealth funds); 2) synchronization of strategic directions for SOEs; and 3) optimization of SOE assets and operational efficiency. However, the execution (including transition and integration), independence, and transparency of this agency are crucial aspects that need attention. Furthermore, at the SOE level itself, there is a risk of reduced independence and agility in determining strategic steps.",

This result brought the net profit for 2024 to 2 trillion rupiah (+10.4% YoY), surpassing expectations as it equaled 108% of the consensus estimate.

The decline in net profit in 4Q24 was mainly caused by a significant increase in operating expenses (+18% YoY, +15% QoQ), causing the operating profit margin to drop to 5.2% in 4Q24 (vs. 4Q23: 7%, 3Q24: 6.09%).

      "title": "Macroeconomic and Commodity Updates: India Vegetable Oil Import Tax, CPO Blending, Malaysia Biodiesel Blend, PPN DTP Extension, M2 Liquidity, JSMR Asset Recycling, Media Meeting, and BBM Subsidy Clarity",
      "content": "Reuters reported that the Indian government is likely to raise vegetable oil import taxes again to help domestic oilseed farmers who are depressed due to falling prices. The increase in import duties could dampen demand and reduce purchases of CPO, soybean oil, and sunflower oil from abroad. Previously, the Indian government in September 2024 had raised import duty tariffs for several edible oils by 20 percentage points, which caused the import duty for CPO to rise to 27.5%. Responding to this issue, the Chairman of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association (GAPKI), Eddy Martono, stated that the discourse on raising import duty tariffs could suppress CPO exports from Indonesia, so GAPKI hopes the Indonesian government can lobby the Indian government regarding this matter. Director at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Edi Wibowo, stated on Saturday (22/2) that the implementation of B40 biodiesel in 2025 requires approximately 14.2 million tons of CPO or equivalent to 28% of the estimated CPO production in 2025 at the level of 50 million tons. For comparison, the CPO requirement for B35 biodiesel in 2024 reached 12.18 million tons or about 24% of the total CPO production in that year at the level of 50 million tons. Minister of Plantation and Commodities of Malaysia, Johari Abdul Ghani, stated on Monday (24/2) that the Malaysian government has no plans to increase the CPO blend in biodiesel from the current level of 10% to 20%. This step was taken because the necessary infrastructure development would require funding of approximately 146.2 million US dollars, while industry and the government are unwilling to provide these funds. The government has officially extended the government-borne Value Added Tax (PPN DTP) incentive for the purchase of landed houses and apartment units until the end of 2025 through the issuance of Minister of Finance Regulation No. 13/2025. The extension of this incentive continues the PPN DTP incentive policy that was previously granted in 2023 and 2024. Through this incentive extension, the handover of landed houses or apartment units with a selling price of approximately 2-5 billion rupiah in January-June 2025 will receive a PPN DTP incentive of 100%. Meanwhile, the handover of landed houses or apartment units with a selling price of approximately 2-5 billion rupiah in July-December 2025 will receive a PPN DTP incentive of 50%. Bank Indonesia recorded that the economy's liquidity or broad money supply (M2) in January 2025 grew by +5.9% YoY (vs. Dec 2024: +4.8% YoY). This result was driven by loan disbursement growing by +9.6% YoY in January 2025 (vs. Dec 2024: +9.7% YoY), net foreign assets growing by +2.4% YoY (vs. Dec 2024: +0.8% YoY), and net claims on the central government being -14.3% YoY (vs. Dec 2024: -17.5% YoY). Member of the Toll Road Regulatory Board for Stakeholder Elements, Sony Sulaksono Wibowo, told Investor Daily that Jasa Marga ($JSMR) plans to divest its ownership in the Manado-Bitung (Mabit) toll road section spanning 39.9 km due to low traffic and bank interest burdens reaching 200 billion rupiah per month. Sony also explained that the low traffic on the Mabit toll road is caused by a lack of attraction from relevant stakeholders to develop the Bitung area, even though the toll road was built to support the Bitung port. Corporate Secretary of JSMR, Ari Wibowo, stated that JSMR in principle remains open to various asset recycling opportunities. JSMR itself holds a 65% stake in the Mabit toll road through PT Jasamarga Manado Bitung. President Prabowo Subianto held a meeting with dozens of mass media editors-in-chief and senior journalistic figures on Saturday (22/2), marking the first meeting since President Prabowo last held a similar meeting in June 2023. Investor Daily reported that the meeting contained discussions regarding various strategic issues and policies, with President Prabowo hoping the meeting would strengthen synergy and media contribution in nation-building. According to political communication expert from Paramadina University, Hendri Satrio, poor government public communication was the reason President Prabowo invited mass media editors-in-chief. Spokesperson for the National Economic Council, Jodi Mahardi, stated on Saturday (22/2) that as of now, no decision has been made by the government regarding changes to the subsidized fuel (BBM) scheme. Therefore, Jodi affirmed that there is no talk of abolishing BBM subsidies in 2027. Jodi's clarification came just 2 days after the Chairman of the National Economic Council, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, said that he had proposed to President Prabowo Subianto to abolish subsidized BBM in 2027 and replace it with direct cash assistance. Meanwhile, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated on Friday (21/2) that the blending scheme—where subsidy distribution combines fuel price subsidies and direct cash assistance—is still the most potential scheme to be implemented in 2025, but he could not provide a definite date regarding the start of the scheme's implementation.",
