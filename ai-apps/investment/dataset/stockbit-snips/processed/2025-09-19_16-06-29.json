      "content": "Bank Mandiri reported a net profit of 11.3 trillion rupiah in 2Q25 (-19% YoY, -15% QoQ). This result brought the net profit for 1H25 to 24.5 trillion rupiah (-8% YoY), below expectations as it equals 44% of the consensus 2025F estimate (vs. 1H24: 48% realization for 2024). This relatively weak net profit performance was mainly caused by a surge in opex. Following the release of the 1H25 performance, BMRI also made adjustments to several 2025 guidance figures.",

      "content": "BMRI booked an opex increase of +35% YoY/+25% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, which was primarily caused by a one-off adjustment from the company's financial statement audit. Although not detailing the exact reason for the increased opex after the audit, BMRI management stated that the size of the adjustment ranges from 10-12% of the estimated 2025F opex. The majority of the adjustment was booked in June 2025, with the remainder to be booked in the coming months. Overall, BMRI management expects that opex for 2025F will grow roughly the same as the growth in 1H25 (+25% YoY). For 2026, BMRI management expects opex to be relatively flat compared to 2025 in the base-case scenario, or to increase by a low-single digit in the bear-case scenario. Aside from opex, key operational metrics were relatively good with Net Interest Income growing +8% YoY/+7% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, while provision expenses only slightly increased by +2% YoY/+5%% YoY.",

Meanwhile, Cost of Credit (CoC) is expected to be better than previous guidance along with asset quality - NPL and LAR - which are maintained. The reduction in credit growth and NIM guidance already accounts for the impact of a 55 trillion rupiah liquidity injection from the government and the expectation that the BI Rate will still be cut by another 50 bps until the end of 2025. According to BMRI management, further clarity is still needed from the government regarding the rules/policies for using these funds - such as the scope of the real sector definition and permitted products - for both assets and liabilities.",

We assess that the acceleration of government spending is what is awaited to start boosting demand, so that the banking sector in general - not just BMRI - will be more confident to increase the pace of credit disbursement. The risk potential we see is if the government mandates a reduction in credit interest rates to help stimulate demand, which could impact banking profitability.",

      "content": "The DPR Legislation Body approved 67 Bills to be included in the priority national legislative program (prolegnas) agenda for deliberation in 2026 on Thursday (18/9). One of the laws to be reviewed is the State Finance Law, which regulates the maximum budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP and the maximum total debt limit of 60% of GDP. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, stated that he does not see the need to change the current budget deficit and debt ratio limits. Reuters reported that 12 economists expect Bank Indonesia to cut interest rates more aggressively following the surprise BI Rate cut on Wednesday (17/9), with a median forecast for the BI Rate to be at 4% in 2026. For context, the consensus from 21 economists surveyed by Reuters before the Bank Indonesia announcement expected the BI Rate to be at 4.5% in 2026. IDX Channel reported that the Minister of Finance, Purbaya Yudhi Sadewa, on Friday (19/9) promised to pay more attention to the tobacco industry, while emphasizing that overly aggressive tobacco excise taxes are an irresponsible policy. Purbaya also highlighted the prevalence of illegal cigarettes and will order his staff to monitor and eradicate the sale of illegal cigarettes, including those sold online. President Prabowo Subianto appointed the Deputy Minister of State-Owned Enterprises and COO of Danantara, Dony Oskaria, as the acting (Plt) Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. Dony's appointment follows Erick Thohir's position change to Minister of Youth and Sports. The National Nutrition Agency reported on Thursday (18/9) that the realization of budget absorption for the Free Nutritious Meal (MBG) program has only reached approximately 8.3 trillion rupiah, with the BGN budget realization target reaching 10 trillion rupiah in October 2025. For context, the budget allocation for the MBG program in 2025 reached 171 trillion rupiah, while the budget allocation for 2026 reaches 335 trillion rupiah.",

This result made the net profit for 1H25 reach 3.7 trillion rupiah (+10% YoY), in line with expectations as it equals 47% of the consensus 2025F estimate (vs. 1H24: 48% realization for the year). Net profit growth was driven by a Net Margin Income increase of +24% YoY/+15% YoY in 2Q25/1H25. Net Remuneration also rose to 5.7% level during 1H25 (vs. 1Q25: 5.3%, 1H24: 5.5%), consistent with the management's 2025 guidance in the range of 5.5-5.9%. However, operational expenses swelled +23% YoY/+20% YoY in 2Q25/1H25, causing PPOP growth to be lower compared to the Net Margin Income growth at +13% YoY/+12% YoY. Meanwhile, the slowdown in Third Party Fund growth as of June 2025 (+9% YoY, vs. 2024: +11% YoY) was more significant than the slowdown in financing growth (+14% YoY, vs. 2024: +16% YoY), causing the Financing-to-Deposit Ratio to increase to 91% (vs. 2024: 85%), the highest level recorded since at least 2020.",
