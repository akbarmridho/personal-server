      "title": "RI Inflation 1.57% YoY in 2024, Lowest in History",
      "content": "BPS noted that Indonesia's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation eased to 1.57% in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 1.55% YoY inflation), below the consensus expectation of 1.6% YoY and marking the lowest calendar year inflation since BPS first calculated inflation in 1958. This realization is within Bank Indonesia's lower target range of 1.5-3.5%. The low annual inflation in 2024 was driven by price decreases in several commodities, such as red chili, bird's eye chili, green chili, gasoline, air transport fares, and cellular phones. Meanwhile, core inflation in December 2024 reached 2.26% YoY (vs. November 2024: 2.26% YoY), lower than the consensus expectation of 2.28% YoY. On a monthly basis, Indonesia recorded inflation of 0.44% MoM (vs. November 2024: 0.30% MoM inflation), in line with expectations and marking the highest increase in the last 9 months. The monthly inflation increase was driven by the food, beverage, and tobacco group which experienced 1.33% MoM inflation, contributing 0.38 percentage point to inflation. Meanwhile, core inflation on a monthly basis was recorded at 0.17% MoM (vs. November 2024: 0.17% MoM inflation). On the same day as the inflation data release, S&P Global noted that Indonesia's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.2 in December 2024 (vs. November 2024: 49.6), marking the first expansion of factory activity since June 2024 as output grew moderately. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry, Febri Hendri Antoni Arif, said that the policy of imposing a 12% VAT starting January 2025 caused industry players to increase their orders for stock, enabling Indonesia's manufacturing PMI in December 2024 to be in the expansive zone. Febri mentioned that industry players tried to seize the momentum before the VAT increase in 2025, although the government eventually revised the regulation to only target luxury goods.",

      "content": "Although the low CPI inflation is mostly caused by the decrease in the prices of several commodities, the realization of core inflation itself is still classified as low - although it has started to increase/improve in recent months - which indicates that public purchasing power is still stagnant. Besides the fiscal aspect (cancellation of the 12% effective VAT tariff and stimulus packages), the impetus for economic growth and public purchasing power can come from the monetary side through an interest rate cut by Bank Indonesia. However, we assess that cutting the BI Rate requires a stronger and more stable rupiah exchange rate first.",
