      "title": "Government Targets +45% YoY Foreign Tourist Visits in 2024",
      "content": "The Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, Sandiaga Uno, increased the target for foreign tourist (wisman) visits to Indonesia in 2024 from 14.3 million to 17 million. This target is 45.5% higher than the 2023 realization of 11.68 million visits. Sandiaga stated that the increased target for 2024 is based on the solid 2023 realization, where foreign tourist visits grew by 98.3% YoY and exceeded (137.4%) the target of 8.5 million. Based on BPS data, the foreign tourists visiting Indonesia during 2023 were dominated by 5 countries, namely Malaysia (1.9 million), Australia (1.43 million), Singapore (1.41 million), China (787,924), and Timor Leste (728,586). The average duration of foreign tourist visits ranged between 7-12 nights. Meanwhile, the hotel occupancy rate in Indonesia rose by 2.84 percentage points in 2023 to 59.74%. Sandiaga is optimistic that the tourism sector can support Indonesia's economic growth in 2024, which is targeted to reach 5.2%. Several initiatives planned to boost foreign tourist visits in 2024 include increasing the number of events and flights, as well as granting visa exemptions for entry to 20 countries outside of Southeast Asia. Although foreign tourist visits far exceeded the 2023 target, Kompas reported that domestic tourist (wisnus) mobility during 2023 is unlikely to reach the target of 1.2-1.4 billion trips. As of yet, BPS has not released the number of domestic tourist movements for 2023. However, based on data up to 11M23, the number of domestic tourist movements reached only 668.9 million trips. This realization increased by 12% YoY, but only met 55.7% of the minimum target. Sandiaga could not comment on the 2023 domestic tourist travel data, as the data is still being finalized by BPS. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy targets domestic tourist mobility in 2024 to reach 1.25-1.5 billion trips. To achieve this target, Kompas reports that the ministry will collaborate with the Ministry of Transportation to suppress air ticket prices, which have been a concern for domestic tourists. Key Takeaway The 2024 foreign tourist visit target is higher than the pre-pandemic foreign tourist visits, which reached 16.1 million in 2019. If this target is achieved, the increase in foreign tourist visits may have a positive impact on tourism-related issuers such as GIAA, PANR, and BAYU. The increase in the number of foreign tourists also has the potential to increase alcohol consumption in Indonesia, which could be a positive catalyst for alcoholic beverage issuers such as WINE, MLBI, DLTA, and BEER. You can learn more about alcohol beverage issuer analysis through this Mini Unboxing. On the other hand, the realization of foreign tourist visits in 2024 will face several challenges, one of which is the general election. We see a safe and conducive political situation throughout the election year as an absolute requirement for the foreign tourist visit target to be achieved.",
