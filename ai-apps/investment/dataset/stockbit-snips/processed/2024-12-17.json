      "content": "The subsidiary of Rukun Raharja (ticker RAJA), Raharja Energi Cepu (ticker RATU), announced a plan to conduct an IPO offering 543.01 million shares (20% of the company), consisting of 190 million new shares (7%) and 352.9 million shares (13%) divested from RAJA ownership. The price range is 900-1,150 IDR per share, implying a market capitalization of approximately 2.4-3.1 trillion IDR. Total proceeds from the IPO are estimated at 488.7-624.5 billion IDR, of which about 171-218.6 billion IDR will go to RATU's cash and about 317.7-405.9 billion IDR to RAJA's cash. RATU is a holding company investing as a non-operator in two Indonesian oil and gas exploration blocks: Cepu Block (â‰ˆ2.2% participation) and Jabung Block (8% participation). In the first half of 2024, Cepu Block produced 144 thousand barrels of oil per day, about 25% of the national oil lifting, while Jabung Block produced 52 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 3.5% of national oil and gas lifting. After the IPO, the shareholder structure of RATU will be RAJA (~80%), PT Rukun Prima Sarana (0.004%), and the public (20%). All IPO funds will be allocated to working capital: approximately 157.36 billion IDR will be loaned to PT Raharja Energi Tanjung Jabung to pay a cash call from PetroChina International Jabung Ltd. for Jabung Block management; about 34.97 billion IDR will be loaned to PT Petrogas Jatim Utama Cendana to pay a cash call from ExxonMobil Cepu Ltd. for Cepu Block management; the remaining funds will be used for employee, director, commissioner remuneration and operational costs. RATU is offered at a valuation of about 6.0-7.6 times 1H24 TTM P/E, or annualized 10.3-13.2 times P/E, lower than RAJA's 22.9 times annualized 1H24 P/E at 2,670 IDR per share. Nevertheless, RATU's valuation is premium compared with peers Medco Energi Internasional (ticker MEDC) and Energi Mega Persada (ticker ENRG), which trade at 4.5 and 4.9 times 9M24 annualized P/E respectively. The analysis concludes that despite a higher valuation than peers, RATU appears justified to trade at a premium due to superior profitability as reflected in higher ROE and ROA.",
