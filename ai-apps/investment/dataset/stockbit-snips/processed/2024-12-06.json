      "title": "PPN 12% Applies Only to Luxury Goods",
      "content": "Chairman of Commission XI of the DPR, Mukhamad Misbakhun, on Thursday (5/12) said that the government will still raise the value-added tax (VAT) from 11% to 12% starting January 2025, although he claimed that the increase will only apply to luxury goods. To date, the government has not released the list of luxury goods that will be subject to the higher VAT. According to Deputy Chairman of the DPR, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, the list of luxury goods subject to 12% VAT will be compiled by the Ministry of Finance. Misbakhun stated that basic goods, education services, health services, banking services, and public services will remain exempt from VAT, in line with existing policy. The government announcement comes amid pressure from business groups and labor unions demanding a postponement of the VAT increase, given the weakening purchasing power of the public. According to a report by Kompas, the burden on society in 2025 will increase due to the limitation of fuel subsidies, as well as the implementation of various levies such as the increase in BPJS Health premium rates, additional mandatory pension fund contributions, and mandatory motor vehicle third‑party liability insurance premiums. In a separate occasion, the Minister of MSMEs, Maman Abdurrahman, said on Thursday (5/12) that the government is reviewing the extension of the final income tax (PPh) rate of 0.5% for MSMEs. Maman also denied rumors that the 0.5% final PPh for MSMEs would end in December 2024. He emphasized that the prevailing provision remains the same, namely 7 years for individual taxpayers and 4 years for corporate taxpayers. Key Takeaway: The selective VAT increase on luxury goods is a government compromise to raise state revenue while preserving the purchasing power of lower‑middle‑class consumers. It generally provides relief to sectors/companies targeting the lower‑middle market, but may negatively affect those targeting the upper‑middle segment. The definition and list of \"luxury goods\" released by the government will need to be monitored to assess sector‑specific impacts.",
