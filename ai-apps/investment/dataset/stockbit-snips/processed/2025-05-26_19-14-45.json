      "title": "Government Prepares Second Round of Economic Stimulus",
      "content": "Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, stated on Saturday (24/5) that the government is preparing 6 packages of economic stimulus measures to maintain public purchasing power, especially during the school holiday period in June-July 2025. These six economic stimulus measures are currently being finalized and are planned to be launched on June 5, 2025, focusing on increasing public activity in the transportation, energy, and social assistance sectors. Here are the details:\n1. Discount on train tickets, airplanes, and sea transportation during the school holiday period.\n2. Toll road tariff reduction in June-July 2025 for 110 million users.\n3. Electricity tariff discount of 50% in June-July 2025, targeted at 79.3 million households with electricity capacity up to 1,300 VA.\n4. Staple food card and food assistance for 18.3 million beneficiary families (KPM).\n5. Wage subsidy assistance (BSU) for workers with salaries below 3.5 million rupiah or according to the provincial minimum wage (UMP).\n6. Discount on work accident insurance contributions (JKK) for workers in labor-intensive sectors.\nThe government also invites local governments to play an active role in creating local tourism and entertainment activities to encourage domestic public movement during the school holidays. This is the second economic stimulus provided by the government this year. Previously, the government released economic stimulus in January-February 2025.\nCore Indonesia Researcher, Yusuf Rendy Manilet, stated that the stimulus package appears to be an emergency measure taken by the government to prevent economic growth from declining further. Yusuf explained that household consumption has the potential to slow down in 2Q25, considering the absence of seasonal moments that usually boost public spending such as Ramadan or Eid al-Fitr.\nIn 1Q25 itself, Indonesia's economic growth reached only +4.87% YoY (vs. 1Q24: +5.11% YoY, 4Q24: +5.02% YoY) - lower than the government's 2025 target of +5.2% YoY - with household consumption declining to +4.89% YoY (vs. 1Q24: +4.91% YoY).\nKey Takeaway\nWe assess the launch of this stimulus package as one of the government's steps to boost economic growth through accelerated spending, after the State Budget returned to a better position in 4M25. Besides accelerating government spending, the prospect of an interest rate cut and an improved investment climate along with the de-escalation of the trade war has the potential to be another source to boost growth, so these factors need to be considered by investors.\nIn general, this stimulus package will have a positive impact on consumption, especially the lower to middle segments. This can be positive sentiment for issuers such as ICBP, MYOR and AMRT.",
