      "title": "BEI Implements Revision of FCA, Preparing to Release Short Sell",
      "content": "Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) officially implemented the revision of the criteria for the special monitoring board (full call auction) on Friday, 21 June 2024. As previously discussed in Stockbit Snips, the revised criteria will tighten the conditions for a stock to be placed on the FCA and provide flexibility for a stock to exit the FCA. In line with the implementation of the revision, six stocks were removed from the special monitoring board on Friday, one of which was Barito Renewable Energy (BREN). Under the previous rule, BREN – which was subject to criterion number 10 on the special monitoring board – could only be traded regularly after 30 calendar days since its inclusion on 29 May 2024. However, because the new criterion number 10 requires only a 7‑trading‑day duration for a stock to exit the special monitoring board, BREN is now allowed to trade regularly and is no longer subject to full call auction. The revision was generally received positively by market participants, with the stocks removed from the special monitoring board moving higher in today’s trading, except those under suspension. In addition to the FCA criteria revision, BEI is preparing to launch a short‑sell trading mechanism, with a target implementation no later than October 2024. As of 14 June 2024, BEI has designated 116 stocks eligible for short‑sell trading, the full list of which can be accessed via the provided link. Short‑sell is a trading mechanism where an investor borrows shares from a broker and sells them on the market, hoping the price will fall. After the price declines, the investor repurchases the shares at a lower price and returns them to the broker, profiting from the price difference. Key takeaway: The revision of the FCA criteria and the implementation of short‑sell have the potential to increase stock transaction liquidity. The extent of investor access to short‑sell will depend on the final mechanism and the exchange’s rules and requirements for its members, which will determine the level of interest among members to engage in short‑sell.",
