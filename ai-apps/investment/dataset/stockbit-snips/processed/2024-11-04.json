      "title": "US Manufacturing and Employment Data Weak",
      "content": "Several US economic data were released on Friday local time (1/11) with weak results. The data released were the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) and nonfarm payroll (NFP) – employment outside the agricultural sector.\n\n- PMI below 50, US manufacturing contracted for 7 months. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the PMI for October 2024 fell to 46.5 (vs September 2024: 47.2), the lowest since July 2023. This indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector for seven consecutive months. The weak data were attributed to a Boeing workers strike.\n\n- NFP growth fell, lowest since December 2020. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported NFP of +12,000 in October 2024. This is far below the average increase of +194,000 over the previous 12 months and the economists' expectation of +113,000 based on a Reuters survey. This also marks the lowest growth since December 2020. The weak NFP growth in October 2024 was caused by reduced jobs in manufacturing and professional and business services. The weak NFP data were also driven by storms Helene and Milton. The Boeing strike also acted as a strong catalyst for the data weakening. This resulted in the unemployment rate in October 2024 remaining flat at 4.1% (vs September 2024: 4.1%). In addition, the BLS also revised down August NFP growth to +78,000 (-51%) and September to +223,000 (-12%), both down 112,000 from previous reports.\n\nThe NFP data is the last crucial data released before the official US election period begins. Nevertheless, surveys still show incumbent Harris ahead of Trump in the upcoming US election. According to the National Polling Average by The New York Times/Siena College (3/11), Harris leads 49% (vs Trump: 48%). Sentiment for Harris's victory is also supported by five other surveys.\n\nIn response to the data, the probability of a Fed rate cut of -50 bps by the end of 2024 as of Monday (4/11) rose to 82% (vs 28/10: 69%), based on the CME FedWatch Tool. The US dollar index (DXY) weakened -0.47% to 103.8 and the 10-year US Treasury yield fell -9 bps to 4.29%.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe weak US economic data increase the probability of US rate cuts by -25 bps each in November and December. This is reflected by the increase in the probability of a rate cut in the last week by 4 percentage points in November to 99.8% and by 12 percentage points in December to 81.5%.\n\nThe US rate-cut sentiment could provide room for rupiah appreciation and further monetary easing by Bank Indonesia. According to Bloomberg consensus as of 4 November 2024, BI is expected to cut rates by at least -25 bps by year-end 2024, same as the expectation on 7 October.\n\nIndonesia 10-year government bond yield fell -3 bps week-over-week to 6.79% today (4/11). However, the rupiah continued to weaken -0.18% week-over-week to 15,753 per US dollar.",

      "title": "Indonesia policy updates",
      "content": "Reuters reported that the Indonesian government will revise the foreign exchange earnings from natural resource exports (DHE-SDA) rule by extending the mandatory placement period for exporters. The amendment aims to increase domestic foreign exchange supply amid continued pressure on the rupiah in recent weeks. Currently, DHE-SDA under Government Regulation No. 36/2023 requires exporters to keep 30% of DHE-SDA in the domestic financial system for a minimum of three months.\n\nThe government will extend the corporate income tax holiday incentive for pioneer industries that invest in Indonesia until December 2025. However, recipients of the tax holiday will still pay a 15% corporate income tax in line with the upcoming global minimum tax. Investment Minister and Head of the Investment Coordinating Board, Rosan Roeslani, said the government can still provide incentives to related companies in other forms. Rosan noted that the tax holiday program has contributed more than 25% to Indonesia’s investment realization.\n\nState-owned enterprises (BUMN) Minister Erick Thohir expressed optimism that the BUMN dividend payout target for 2025 of 90 trillion rupiah can be achieved. This target is higher than the 2024 APBN target of 85.54 trillion rupiah.\n\nCoordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartanto said the government will extend tax incentives, including for the housing sector and electric vehicles, until next year. The extension of value-added tax (PPN-DTP) and luxury goods sales tax (PPnBM-DTP) incentives has not been detailed regarding budget size or quota. Airlangga stated the policy aims to boost consumer purchasing power to support significant economic growth.\n\nAgriculture Minister Andi Amran Sulaiman announced that the government has prepared three dairy farm sites covering 92 hectares for Vietnamese investors. The three sites will be located in Central Sulawesi, South Kalimantan, and South Sulawesi, with the site in Poso, Central Sulawesi already reviewed together with the Vietnamese company TH Group.\n\nThe German automaker Volkswagen’s workers council said Volkswagen plans massive layoffs, plant closures, and salary cuts. The council indicated that at least three plants in Germany will be closed and tens of thousands of employees will be dismissed.",
