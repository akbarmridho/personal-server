      "title": "The Fed Signals Delay in Interest Rate Cuts, Rupiah Weakens",
      "content": "The Fed Head, Jerome Powell, signaled that the start of US interest rate cuts will take longer than expected as inflation is outpacing expectations and the labor market conditions remain strong. Powell also stated that if inflationary pressures continue, the Fed may keep interest rates stable for as long as necessary. In March 2024, the US recorded 3.5% YoY inflation (vs. February 2024: 3.2% inflation), exceeding the consensus expectation of 3.4%. This result marked the third consecutive time the inflation rate was higher than expected. This inflationary pressure strengthens the narrative that US interest rates will remain at a high level for longer ('higher for longer'). Based on analysis from the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of the Fed cutting interest rates at the June 2024 meeting dropped drastically from 61.1% on April 2, 2024, to 15.2% as of April 17, 2024. Currently, the market expects that the Fed will only start cutting interest rates in 3Q24, with only 1-2 cuts during 2024. Previously, the Fed projected 3 interest rate cuts in 2024. The negative impact of the 'higher for longer' narrative was also felt in Indonesia, marked by the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar which weakened to touch the 16,300 level on Wednesday (17/4) morning. Bank Indonesia itself has intervened in the spot and non-deliverable forward markets to maintain exchange rate stability. In October 2023, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly raised the BI Rate by 25 bps after the rupiah weakened to the 15,860 level, which was the lowest exchange rate since April 2020. Key Takeaway: The Fed's signal to delay US interest rate cuts potentially impacts the retreat of BI Rate cut expectations. Previously, the consensus of economists compiled by Bloomberg still projected that Bank Indonesia would start cutting the benchmark interest rate in 3Q24. The 'higher for longer' narrative also potentially has a negative impact on stocks in sectors sensitive to interest rates, such as banking, property, and technology. On the other hand, the strengthening of the US dollar could be positive news for issuers that have a significant portion of export sales, such as ITMG, ADRO, INKP, TKIM, MYOR, ICBP. Meanwhile, Indonesian government bond yields also increased alongside expectations that interest rates will remain high, with the 10-year government bond yield having risen 58 bps since the beginning of the year. Investors can take advantage of the opportunity to lock in more attractive yields on FR bond instruments (if held until maturity), such as the FR0097 series which achieved a yield of 7.05% per year as of April 17, 2024.
