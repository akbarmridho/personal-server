      "content": "1. The Minister of Finance, Sri Mulyani, stated that the realization of state revenue in 1H25 only reached 1,201.8 trillion IDR (-9% YoY), equivalent to only 40% of the 2025 State Budget target and marking the lowest achievement in the last 3 years. For comparison, state revenue realization in 1H24 was equivalent to 47% of the 2024 State Budget target, in 1H23 was equivalent to 57% of the 2023 State Budget target, and in 1H22 was equivalent to 59% of the 2022 State Budget target. Sri Mulyani explained that this decline was caused by weakening commodity prices, the transfer of State-Owned Enterprise dividends to BPI Danantara, and the cancellation of the 12% VAT implementation. 2. The Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Bahlil Lahadalia, stated that the government plans to cut the duration of mining quotas (Work Plan and Budget/RKAB) from 3 years to 1 year. This step is aimed at improving governance in the mining sector and as an effort to better control the supply of coal and ore. Previously, the RKAB was set annually, but the government changed it to once every 3 years in 2023 for administrative convenience. 3. The US tax cut and state spending bill amounting to 3.3 trillion US dollars proposed by US President Donald Trump was passed by the US Senate on Tuesday (1/7). Previously, the US House of Representatives passed the Bill on May 22, 2025, and currently, the Bill will return to the House for final approval after amendments from the US Senate. If approved by the US House, this Bill will provide a tax cut of 4.5 trillion US dollars and a state spending cut of 1.2 trillion US dollars. 4. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has issued Ministerial Regulation No. 14/2025 to attract investment from oil drilling technology providers to increase production from existing wells. Based on the new policy, oil and gas block operators will be allowed to partner with technology providers to increase production from old or idle wells or fields, which often receive less focus from operators as they prioritize new, more economical wells. The Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Yuliot Tanjung, stated that the government has identified approximately 2,500 wells and more than 100 fields or structures that can be opened by operators to partner with technology providers. 5. Bloomberg reported that PT Pertamina and its subsidiary, PT Pertamina International Shipping, are seeking an overseas loan of around 700 million US dollars with a tenor of approximately 10 years for vessel construction. Bloomberg sources mentioned that the details of the agreement may change because discussions with lenders are still in the early stages. 6. Bumi Resources announced that Yingbin Ian He and Jinping Ma have submitted their resignations from their respective positions as directors and commissioners of the company.",
