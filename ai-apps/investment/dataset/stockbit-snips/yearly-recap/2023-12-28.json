      "title": "Indonesia Economic Report",
      "content": "GDP\nIndonesia's economic growth slowed to 4.94% YoY in Q3 2023, lower than the consensus expectation of 5.05% and down from 5.17% growth in Q2 2023. This result aligns with Bank Indonesia's projection that GDP growth for 2023 would be in the range of 4.5% to 5.3%.\n\nInflation\nIndonesia's annual inflation rate rose to 2.86% in November 2023, up from 2.56% the previous month, exceeding the market forecast of 2.7%, and remained within the central bank's target range of 2‑4% for the seventh consecutive month.\nCore inflation slowed to a 22‑month low of 1.87% in November, compared with an expectation of 1.9%. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia projects inflation to stay within the 3±1% target this year and 2.5±1% in 2024.\n\nInterest Rate\nBank Indonesia kept its policy rate at 6% for the second consecutive meeting in December 2023, in line with market expectations. The central bank stated that the decision was consistent with efforts to strengthen rupiah stability and anticipatory steps to keep inflation within the target range.\n\nManufacturing PMI\nThe S&P Global Indonesia Manufacturing PMI edged up to 51.7 in November 2023, from the eight‑month low in October. This marks 27 consecutive months of factory activity growth, with output rising to the highest level since August and a renewed increase in employment.\n\nTrade Balance\nIndonesia's trade balance fell to USD 2.41 billion in November 2023 from USD 5.10 billion in the same month of 2022, below the market estimate of USD 3.05 billion. The decline was caused by lower exports while imports grew. Goods shipments dropped 8.56% year‑on‑year to USD 22 billion, whereas imports rose 3.29% YoY to USD 19.59 billion, the first increase in six months.\n\nCurrent Account Balance\nIndonesia recorded a current account deficit of USD 0.86 billion (0.2% of GDP) in Q3 2023, reversing from a surplus of USD 4.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. This quarter marked the second consecutive current‑account deficit, as the trade surplus narrowed to USD 10.27 billion in Q3 2023 from USD 17.62 billion in the same period of 2022, amid commodity price moderation.\n\nForeign Exchange Reserves\nIndonesia's foreign exchange reserves rose to USD 138.1 billion in November 2023 from USD 133.1 billion the month before. The increase was driven by the issuance of global sukuk, foreign loan drawdowns by the government, as well as tax and service revenue receipts.\nThe central bank noted that official reserve assets were equivalent to 6.1 months of imports and external debt service, remaining adequate to support financial system stability and macro‑economic prospects.\n\nCredit Growth\nCredit growth in Indonesia accelerated to 9.70% in November 2023 compared with 8.99% a year earlier. This represents a significant increase relative to the pre‑pandemic (2019) level of +6.1% YoY.\n\nMarket Capital Achievements\nNumber of Investors\nAs of 20 December 2023, the number of capital market investors reached 12.13 million, up 17.6% from 10.31 million at the end of 2022. The total consists of stock investors (5.23 million), mutual fund investors (11.37 million) and government securities investors (999 thousand).\n\nNumber of IPO Shares\nThe number of new issuers listed on BEI in 2023 reached 79 companies, the highest annual IPO count in history. The total funds raised from IPOs in 2023 amounted to IDR 54.4 trillion.\n\nMarket Capitalization and IHSG Performance\nOn 27 December 2023, the IHSG market capitalization was IDR 11,672 trillion, up 22.9% from the end‑2022 level of IDR 9,499 trillion. In addition to share price gains, the surge of large‑scale IPOs also contributed to the market‑cap growth.\n$BBCA remains the issuer with the largest market capitalization at IDR 1,144 trillion. Notably, BBCA's top‑market‑cap dominance was briefly displaced on 8 December 2023 by newcomer Barito Renewables Energy ($BREN).\nYear‑to‑date up to 27 December 2023, the IHSG recorded a gain of +5.77%.\n\nSpecial Monitoring Board\nOn 12 June 2023, BEI launched a Special Monitoring Board aimed at enhancing investor protection and ensuring orderly, fair, and efficient trading. Implementation is divided into two phases: Phase I allows hybrid trading (call auction and continuous auction) based on set criteria, while Phase II conducts trading fully via call auction.\n\nNormalization of Pandemic‑Era Relaxation Policies\nThroughout 2023, BEI began normalizing various relaxation policies applied during the COVID‑19 pandemic, such as:\n- Trading hours were restored to pre‑pandemic conditions effective 3 April 2023.\n- The percentage limits for Auto‑Reject Upper and Lower were gradually reinstated to symmetric levels effective 4 September 2023.",
