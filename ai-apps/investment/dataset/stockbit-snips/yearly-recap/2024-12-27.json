      "title": "2024 Recap: Year of Rate Cuts and Elections",
      "content": "During 2024, expectations of interest rate cuts and their developments became the main focus of market participants and caused significant market volatility. At the end of 2023, the Fed projected that it would cut US interest rates by 75 basis points during 2024. However, unexpectedly, the Fed in April 2024 signaled a higher-for-longer stance and postponed the planned rate cuts as disinflation progressed slowly and the US labor market remained solid.\n\nThe Fed’s move put pressure on the rupiah exchange rate and prompted Bank Indonesia, also unexpectedly, to raise the BI Rate by 25 basis points in April 2024. Added to concerns about Indonesia’s fiscal prudence, the rupiah weakened against the US dollar to near 16,500 per dollar in June 2024, marking the lowest level since April 2020.\n\nThe situation reversed in 3Q24, when the rate-cut narrative regained strength in July 2024 as US employment data weakened. In September 2024, Bank Indonesia unexpectedly cut the policy rate by 25 basis points to 6% as the rupiah recovered to around 15,000 per dollar. In the same month, the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, followed by a 25-basis-point cut in November 2024. The Fed ended 2024 with a 25-basis-point cut in December 2024, but projected a smaller series of US rate cuts in 2025.\n\nThe year was also a political year, with presidential elections in Indonesia and the United States. In Indonesia, President-elect Prabowo Subianto’s administration continued a plan to raise VAT to 12% starting 2025 to finance fiscal needs, despite weakening consumer purchasing power. In the United States, Donald Trump’s election victory created risks of a weaker Chinese economy and could push US inflation higher in the future due to his proposed protectionist policies.",
