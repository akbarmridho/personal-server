## Market Outlook: What’s Next?

As detailed in our **exclusive research last month**, we **maintain a cautious view** on the Indonesian equity market and **expect downside correction in 4Q25**.

We might see **early signs of volatility starting this week**, as the **US–China trade conflict** takes the spotlight following **President Trump’s threat to impose an additional 100% tariff on China**.

For now, this appears to be a **“strongman posture”** by the US, as **President Xi and Trump** are expected to **meet before the tariff deadline (1 November 2025)** — suggesting possible **de-escalation or rollback** beforehand.

## Key Risks & Observations

* **IHSG overbought:** Trading at overbought levels with **peak bullishness** in sight
* **Profit-taking likely:** Market has rallied **+40% since April 2025**, making **risk-reward unappealing**
* **Leverage trading concerns:** Increasing speculation in **illiquid small-cap stocks**, driven by **narrative-based momentum**

## Earnings & Macro Themes

* **3Q25 earnings season** will act as a **de-risking moment**, as results are **unlikely to show growth inflection**
* **2026 guidance** will be **closely watched**, but a **meaningful shift in outlook** remains unlikely

**Analysts’ expectations:**

* The **Fed may cut rates by another 50bps** (2x 25bps) before end-2025
* **Watch US inflation data** this week — a **hotter-than-expected CPI** would be **hawkish** and could shift 2026 policy direction
