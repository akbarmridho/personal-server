# Weekly Market Recap (2025-10-20)

## Market Overview

**IHSG** closed down **-4.1% WoW**, trading at **7,915** after weeks of being at **overbought levels** with **overweight positioning** by both retail and institutional investors.

As mentioned in our *Market Mood #17* newsletter last week, the **selloff in the conglomerate complex** was largely **anticipated**, given the rising volatility as traders increasingly used **leverage trading** over the past month.

This was further **fueled by peak bullishness and profit-taking**, as the equity market had gained **+40% since its April 2025 low**, meeting strong **resistance at 8,200** with an **unattractive risk-reward setup**.

## Index Performance

**Blue-chip indexes** declined as well:

* **LQ45:** -2.7% WoW
* **Sri-Kehati:** -2.4% WoW

However, several **large-cap fundamental stocks** such as **BBCA** and **AMRT** managed to close **higher** last week.

## Market Outlook: What’s Next?

We **maintain a cautious view** on the **Indonesian equity market**, expecting a **tactical rotation back to defensives** as investors begin to **play it safer** — locking in profits and defending outperformance before year-end.

**Big bank stocks** currently look **appealing** with **attractive tactical risk-reward** as we head into the **3Q25 earnings season**.
The **2026 guidance** will be crucial to determine whether this tactical opportunity evolves into a **momentum-driven upside** in **4Q25**.

If **2026 guidance** remains **weaker than estimated** and **no catalysts emerge**, expect **consolidation and sideways movements** from fundamental stocks.
That said, **foreign outflows** appear to have **subsided** for now.

## Key Watch: Conglomerate Complex

The **next wave in conglomerate stocks** will largely depend on **MSCI index inclusion decisions** next month.
If **BREN** and **BRMS** are included, we could see **another leg up**, provided **no major macro risks** emerge.
