# Weekly Market Recap (2025-09-22)

## Market Overview

After **flirting with the psychological level of 8,000** for the past five weeks, **IHSG finally broke through**, closing at **8,051 (+2.5% WoW)** last week.

Yes — you might have guessed it — this milestone was driven **almost entirely by the conglomerate stocks**, with standout performances from:

* **BRPT:** +33% WoW
* **DSSA:** +11.5% WoW
* **MLPT:** +97% WoW

## Fundamental vs. Conglomerate Stocks

As we have **repeatedly noted**, despite **positive catalysts** such as **interest rate cuts** by both the **Fed** and **Bank Indonesia**, **fundamental stocks continued to lag**:

* **BMRI:** -3.0% WoW
* **BBCA:** -1.6% WoW
* **BBNI:** -5.5% WoW

### Foreign Flow Trends

Indonesian **big-bank stocks** continued to experience **consistent foreign selling**, most notably:

* **BBCA recorded IDR 1.3 trillion in outflows**,
  a concerning signal given it is typically **a foreign investors’ darling** and **a proxy for Indonesia’s equity market**.

## Market Outlook

### What Now?

Since the **rotation into big-banks** that most investors had anticipated **has yet to materialize**, and with both **monetary (rate cuts)** and **fiscal policy (deposit placements)** **already priced in**,
the **outlook for fundamental stocks remains weak**.

This leaves the **conglomerate complex** as the **sole driver of momentum and liquidity** within IHSG —
a dynamic that **increases concentration risk** as investors **depend more on MSCI/index inflows** for **exit liquidity**.

## Looking Ahead

The **3Q25 financial reporting season** begins **next month**, and until then:

* **Trading value and volume** for **fundamental stocks** are likely to **remain muted**.
* **Market activity** will likely stay **centered around conglomerates and speculative names**.

**In summary:** IHSG’s breakout above 8,000 was a **technical victory** led by **conglomerate momentum**, not fundamentals — and risks of over-concentration are rising.
