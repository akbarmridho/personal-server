## Market Commentary

**Overheard IHSG:**

> “Market is very quiet now, it’s so boring to trade.” — *Retail trader, loosely translated*

Despite this sentiment, **total trading value** for major stocks reached **IDR33.5tn** last week:

* BBCA: IDR13.5tn
* BBRI: IDR5.8tn
* BMRI: IDR5.8tn
* BBNI: IDR2.6tn
* TLKM: IDR2.5tn
* ASII: IDR2tn
* UNVR: IDR1.3tn

This implies **retail traders likely missed the rally** in fundamental stocks, focusing instead on conglomerate or micro-cap names.

## Foreign Flows & Institutional Activity

* **Foreign investors:** Net inflows of **+IDR4.2tn**, up from +IDR1.9tn the previous week.
* Buying interest centered on **large-cap defensive stocks**.

**Supporting news:**

* Possible **Danantara entry** (liquidity provider / outright purchase) into the equity market
* **BBCA’s IDR5tn buyback**
* **TLKM’s restructuring plan**
* **UNVR’s positive 3Q25 results**

## Outlook: What’s Next?

We could see **continued positive momentum and sentiment** in fundamental stocks as:

* **China–US** move closer to a potential **trade deal**
* **Another US rate cut** may come this month

### Watchlist: Oil Stocks

Oil prices rose sharply:

* **Brent & WTI:** +7% WoW
* Driven by **US–EU sanctions** on Russian oil firms (*Lukoil, Rosneft*), which account for ~5% of global output.

## Corporate Results & Macro Policy

* **3Q25 results:** Largely *in-line*
* Outlook: *Cautiously optimistic* for 2026 — more clarity needed, especially from **banks** and **consumer sectors**
* See our insights on **BBNI** and **BBCA**

### Bank Indonesia

* **Kept rate at 4.75%**, defying consensus expectations for a cut
* Decision aimed at **maintaining Rupiah stability**, given recent volatility
