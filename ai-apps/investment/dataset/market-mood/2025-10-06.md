## Market Outlook

As detailed in our **previous exclusive research**, we **maintain a cautious view** on the **Indonesian equity market**, expecting a **downside correction in 4Q25**.

This view is based on the assumption that **most news and narrative-driven catalysts** (e.g., **rate cuts** and **policy momentum**) are **fading** and largely **priced in** by the market.

## Earnings & Corporate Guidance

The **3Q25 earnings season** is underway and will likely bring **downward revisions in estimates**.
**2026 guidance** will carry more weight — however, most companies’ outlooks are expected to **remain subdued**, **except select miners** that may still benefit from commodity tailwinds.

## Trading Dynamics

**Retail investors** have dominated **IHSG activity** over the past **3 months**, accounting for roughly **50% of total trade value** — a level **last seen in Jan-25**.

This concentration raises the **risk of retail profit-taking** into year-end, especially with:

* The **November MSCI rebalancing** serving as the **final flow catalyst**, and
* **Barito Group proxies** (e.g., **BREN**) being the **favourite contenders for inclusion**.
