title: "BBCA: 3Q25 Earnings Growth Slowed, But Plans IDR5tn Buyback"
---

Bank Central Asia (BBCA) recently released its 3Q25 financial performance, which largely came in-line with consensus expectations. The company also announced a buyback program, which was timely as we are seeing tactical flows back into large-cap defensive stocks this week.

**Behind the numbers:** BBCA recorded a net profit of IDR 14.4 trillion (-3% QoQ, +1% YoY) in 3Q25, bringing its total earnings to IDR 43.4 trillion (+6% YoY) in 9M25.

- Net interest income grew +1.5% YoY (-0.2% QoQ) in 3Q25 (9M25: +5% YoY), leading to sequentially lower net interest margin (NIM) from 5.8% in 2Q25 to 5.7% in 3Q25.
- Meanwhile, non-interest income growth stood at +16% YoY (+10% QoQ) in 3Q25 (9M25: +12% YoY), mainly supported by fees & commissions.
- Consequently, pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) increased by +5.6% YoY (+2% QoQ) in 3Q25 (9M25: +8% YoY) on higher operating expense (+2% QoQ, +4% YoY).
- The biggest drag on earnings came from provision, which reached IDR 1.5 trillion (+55% QoQ, +57% YoY) in 3Q25, totalling IDR 3.5 trillion (+60% YoY) in 9M25.

**Corporate dominates:** Total loans grew +7.6% YoY (-1.6% QoQ) to IDR 944 trillion in 9M25, marking a substantial slowdown from +13% YoY in 6M25 as loan appetite remained subdued amid a soft economy.

- By segment, corporate (46% of total) accelerated +10.4% YoY (-3.3% QoQ), mostly used for investment purposes accounting for 54% of the segment’s total. The sequential decline was due to easing quarterly utilization rate.
- SME (14% of total) was the second loan growth driver, up +7.7% YoY (+1.8% QoQ), followed by commercial (15% of total), which increased +5.6% YoY (-0.5% QoQ).
- As for the consumer segment (24% of total), it grew +3.3% YoY (-1.3% QoQ), driven mainly by mortgages (15% of total) that expanded +6.4% YoY (+0.8% QoQ).
- Specific for mortgages, the deceleration in 2025 was visible across the industry as the housing sector struggled with weak demand due to declining income, especially among middle-income households.

**Ample of liquidity:** Total third-party funds stood at IDR 1,205 trillion (+1.3% QoQ, +7% YoY) in 9M25, supported by CASA (current account, savings account) growth of +9.1% YoY (+1.7% QoQ), which brought CASA ratio higher to 82.9% (6M25: 82.5%).

- Accordingly, BBCA’s loan-deposit ratio (LDR) fell from 80.7% in 6M25 to 78.4% in 9M25 (9M24: 78%), mostly due to declining quarterly loan outstanding.

**Conservative approach:** Despite largely stable asset quality with lower NPL (9M25: 2.1%), management highlighted slightly higher special mention loans (SML) in the SME and consumer segments.

Thus, management applied a conservative stance by raising its cost of credit (CoC) from 0.5% in 2Q25 to 0.6% in 3Q25, higher than its previous guidance of 0.3%.

- However, the bank expects performance to improve in 2026, projecting more government spending and looser monetary policy.

**Corporate action:** Additionally, BBCA announced a buyback program up to IDR 5 trillion starting from 22nd October 2025 until 19th January 2026.

- The maximum buyback price is set at IDR 9,200/share, +16% higher than yesterday’s price of IDR 7,875/share.
- During the meeting, management also suggested the possibility of increasing dividend payout ratio in the future. Note that BBCA’s payout ratio was around 67% in 2024, with a yield of 3%.

Bottom line: BBCA delivered another steady performance in 3Q25, where it is the only performing bank among large-cap peers in IHSG. Nevertheless, its share price is still down meaningfully by -15% this year.
