title: "Danantara to Create an Asset Management Behemoth Through Merger?"
---

According to Bloomberg, Indonesia’s sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, is reportedly planning to establish a national asset management company by merging several of the largest SOE asset management units to compete both locally and internationally. This news has not been confirmed by Danantara.

What’s the headline? Allegedly, Danantara plans to merge the asset management divisions of Bank Mandiri (BMRI), Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI), and Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI), targeted for completion as soon as 1Q26.

Based on the latest available data from Bareksa, the combined total assets under management (AUM) of the three asset managers amount to around IDR 103 trillion (equivalent to $6.2 billion).

BRI Manajemen Investasi (IDR 44.5 trillion) holds the largest AUM, followed by Mandiri Manajemen Investasi (IDR 29.6 trillion) and BNI Asset Management (IDR 28.7 trillion). Note these figures exclude discretionary funds.

Additionally, if Bahana-TCW Investment Management (AUM: IDR 49.6 trillion), a joint venture between the Indonesian government and Trust Company of the West, is included, the potential combined AUM would reach IDR 152.6 trillion (equivalent to $9.2 billion).

Capital market initiatives: Danantara stated that it plans to deploy nearly $10 billion in 4Q25, where 80% of the funds is earmarked for domestic investment and 20% oversees.

According to the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), part of the domestic investment will be directed towards capital markets, including bonds and equities.

On this note, the fund is working on initiatives to boost Indonesian stock market liquidity from currently around $1 billion per day to approximately $5–8 billion.

Assuming that 5–10% of the domestic allocation is invested in capital markets, that would amount to roughly $400–800 million in potential liquidity.

The CIO also hinted that he wants to see Indonesia’s weighting in the MSCI index increase to 5–8% from currently 1%, though this goal is extremely ambitious as Indonesia’s market size is still very small.

Between the lines: The Chief Executive Officer of Danantara expects the sovereign wealth fund to receive around IDR 140 trillion (equivalent to $8.5 billion) in total SOE dividends in 2025, up +63% YoY from last year.

Separately, Danantara has reportedly raised IDR 51.7 trillion (equivalent to $3.1 billion) in funding from its first round of “Patriot” bond. The total target for the bond program is IDR 100 trillion (equivalent to $6 billion).

Bottom line: The recent news regarding the potential plan to merge SOE asset management companies is expected to provide only short-term positive sentiment for SOE stocks, as the corporate action is not yet confirmed by Danantara.
