title: Rupiah Is the Worst Performing Currency in ASEAN, Here's Why
---

In the past one year, the Indonesian rupiah (IDR) has been the worst-performing currency among major ASEAN economies, depreciating by -6.3% against USD.

Even though the weakness in IDR is not entirely unique, particularly after the US trade war policy in Apr-25, several domestic issues have driven investors to sell the rupiah and move toward more stable currencies.

These include: 1). Sluggish growth with limited catalysts, 2). Unproductive policies combined with a high debt burden, and 3). An uncertain political landscape, which are eroding confidence and stability of the rupiah.

Consequently, Bank Indonesia (BI) has been defending the currency throughout 2025, as reflected in the sharp drop in Indonesia’s foreign exchange reserves, down from $156 billion in Dec-24 to $149 billion in Sep-25.

Nevertheless, IDR is now trading around 16,600 against USD, and only 2.4% away from the “critical” level of 17,000. If that threshold is broken sustainably, it could trigger further depreciation and weigh on economic growth.

## The weakest among them all

Compared to the ASEAN-6 currencies, Thai baht (THB) is the best-performing against USD, up +2.95% over the past year. This is followed by Malaysian ringgit (MYR) and Singaporean dollar (SGD), which have appreciated +2.4% and +0.3%, respectively.

The remaining three currencies, Philippine peso (PHP), Vietnamese dong (VND), and Indonesian rupiah (IDR), have all weakened against USD by -2.5%, -5%, and -6.3%, respectively.

If we include major Asian economies such as Japanese yen (JPY), Korean won (KRW), Chinese renminbi (CNY), and Indian rupee (INR), rupiah still ranks as the worst-performing among them all.

Additionally, over a longer horizon from 2005 to 2025, IDR remains the weakest among the ASEAN-6 currencies, having depreciated nearly -40% against USD. It only fares better than INR (-50%) including the major Asian FX.

Note that the rupiah was relatively stable between 2005 and 2010, except for the 2008 financial crisis, where it was trading at around 9,500.

The first major depreciation for the IDR began in 2013, which was triggered by the “taper tantrum,” when US central bank announced plans to scale back its bond-buying program.

Although the Fed later clarified that the reduction would be gradual, the damage was already done as volatility spiked during that period.

This led to substantial capital outflows from EM, with Indonesia among the hardest hit (part of the “Fragile Five”) as the country was running “twin deficits” (i.e. current account and government budget).

Furthermore, IDR depreciation was exacerbated by the commodity market downturn in 2015 as China’s economic growth slowed due to weaknesses in its manufacturing and property sectors.

Ultimately, IDR plunged significantly vs. USD from 9,500 to 14,500 (-34%) in 2013 to 2015 before stabilizing in the 13,500–14,200 range from 2016 to 2019 (except for widening deficits in 2018), just before the pandemic in 2020.

## A tightening period

In just one month, rupiah plummeted from 13,500 to 16,400 when the pandemic first emerged as a global risk in Mar-20, grinding the global economy almost to a halt.

Subsequent coordination by the Indonesian government and BI to stimulate the economy helped stabilize the currency at around 14,300 from 2021 to 2022.

However, another depreciation cycle began in 2022 when the US central bank started quantitative tightening (QT) to tackle rising inflation.

As a result, higher US interest rates triggered capital outflows from Indonesia (and other EMs), as the spread between Indonesian and US bond yields narrowed, making rupiah-denominated assets less attractive.

For instance, foreign investors' ownership in Indonesian government bonds declined from IDR 1,050 trillion at the end of 2019 to IDR 713 trillion in 3Q22, implying IDR 337 trillion in capital outflows in two years (assuming no matured or runoffs bond positions).

The commodity backdrop was challenging too, as rising oil prices from the 2022 Russia-Ukraine war drove inflation higher in Indonesia, squeezing purchasing power of low-middle income household.

Meanwhile, the increase in prices of other commodities such as coal, CPO and nickel boosted export growth but failed to create a material trickle-down effect on domestic consumption.

The increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) also did not contribute much to consumption (and employment), as it was mainly concentrated in capital-intensive industries with minimal spillover to the broader economy.

In fact, since most of the FDI was in the form of imported machinery and materials, as seen in the diverging trend with direct investment flows, it had a net negative effect on the rupiah, creating further downward pressure.

Accordingly, the IDR depreciated consistently from 14,300 in 2022 to above 16,000 in 2024. Yet, this time, it weakened substantially in just two years compared to the seven-year range of 13,500–14,300 from 2015–2022.

## One year of uncertainty

The past year has been filled with uncertainty in Indonesia, coming from both global and domestic risks.

Globally, the US-led trade war has created downside risks to global supply chains, fueling stagflation concerns.

Domestically, policies have come under scrutiny as the new Indonesian government pursues “pro-growth” spending programs such as free meals, housing initiatives, major infrastructure, and defense and food security projects.

However, despite the scale of these initiatives, their returns are questionable, raising concerns about unproductive fiscal expenditure financed through costly and unsustainable debt.

Already, nearly 20% of total central government revenue is spent on interest payments, leaving less room for productive allocation.

If this trajectory continues, raising taxes may become the only option, a move that could further weaken household purchasing power, income, and economic activity.

At the same time, the Indonesian economy is unable to return to the pre-pandemic growth trend, with domestic consumption remaining soft and government stimulus showing limited impact so far.

Nevertheless, these negative impacts have already translated into significant foreign outflows from the equity market over the past year as earnings continue to decline, especially among the large cap stocks like banks.

On this note, although we have started to see foreign investors' inflows since Aug-25 as the Fed loosened policy rate, the outlook is uncertain as the US central bank gave a more hawkish guidance during the latest meeting.

Ultimately, as these risks unfold with no concentrate policies and clear catalysts in Indonesia, the credibility and stability of the rupiah could continue to erode, leaving BI to safeguard the currency from depreciating further.
