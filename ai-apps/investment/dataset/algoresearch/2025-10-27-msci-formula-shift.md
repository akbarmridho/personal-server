title: Potential MSCI Formula Shift Puts Indonesia in Focus
---

Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) is currently holding a consultation regarding proposed changes to its estimated free float calculations for specific markets, including Indonesia.

MSCI publishes benchmark indexes covering various markets and company sizes such as Global ACWI, Emerging Markets, Frontier Markets, and Small Cap, which are widely tracked by institutional investors globally.

In fact, many mutual funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds) use MSCI indexes as benchmarks to measure performances, with reportedly over $16.5 trillion in total assets tied to the indexes.

## **Indonesia’s standing in MSCI**

The MSCI Indonesia Index is designed to measure the performance of the large and mid-cap segments of the Indonesian market, which consists of 18 constituents that cover around 85% of the Indonesian equity universe.

It had a market capitalization of $109 billion (equivalent to IDR 1,798 trillion) as of September 2025, with a median and average market capitalization of $3.8 billion and $6.1 billion, respectively.

1. The largest weighting is financial, accounting for 50% of total, followed by materials (14%), energy (10%), communication services (8%), consumer staples (7%), industrials (7%), consumer discretionary (3%), and healthcare (1%).

2. Among the top 10 constituents, BBCA has the largest weighting of 23.2%, followed by BBRI (14.6%), BMRI (9.0%), TLKM (8.3%), ASII (6.4%), DSSA (5.8%), AMMN (5.7%), BRPT (4.8%), TPIA (3.6%), and BBNI (3.3%).

3. MSCI Indonesia Index has significantly underperformed emerging market peers, down -7% YTD (MSCI EM: +27.5%) and is currently trading at 11.5x forward price-earnings ratio.

Why it matters? When a stock is included in an MSCI index, it typically attracts substantial foreign inflows from global funds as they must buy the stock to align with the benchmark.

For instance, the latest inclusions to the MSCI index were DSSA and CUAN, where the stocks reportedly received around $350-500 million and $150-200million in net foreign inflows, respectively.

Additionally, more stocks (or weighting upgrades) in MSCI indexes raise Indonesia’s global profile, potentially inviting greater foreign interests, while improving liquidity and access to capital.

Unfortunately, Indonesia’s weighting in MSCI remains relatively small at around 1%. Hence, the equity market still needs better fundamentals, greater depth (i.e. large-cap IPOs), and higher trading volume going forward.

## **MSCI calculation adjustment**

Publicly listed Indonesian companies typically disclose shareholders composition of 5% or more in their public fillings.

1. In order to make its free float calculations more accurate, MSCI is considering using the monthly holding data from KSEI (Indonesia Central Securities Depository).

2. This could provide better visibility into shareholding compositions, as it captures ownership of less than 5%.

However, MSCI notes that the KSEI report cannot be used independently to estimate free float calculations since it does not necessarily identify individual shareholders.

1. Instead, the report provides composition data based on specific categories such as corporates, individuals, mutual funds, financial institutions, insurance, securities, pension funds, foundations, and others.

Therefore, MSCI proposes to use the KSEI report as an additional reference when estimating free float for Indonesian equities. Subsequently, the final free float calculation would be the lower of:

2. Option 1: Free float calculated using shareholding data disclosed in company filings, reports, and press releases, based on the MSCI methodology; and

3. Free float estimated from the KSEI report by classifying all scrip shares and holdings under the categories of “Corporates” and “Others” for both local and foreign investors, as non-free float.

4. Option 2): MSCI could estimate the KSEI-based free float calculations by considering only scrip shares and “Corporates” (local and foreign) as non-free float.

The problem with using this approach is that it may understate the actual real free float, as institutional investors that are classified under "Corporate" or "Others" would be excluded.

Note that MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes (GIMI), which include Indonesia, are based on free float-adjusted market capitalization.

Whereby, free float is defined as the portion of shares available for trading in the open market. MSCI also applies a Foreign Inclusion Factor (FIF) to each security to reflect its free float-adjusted capitalization.

FIF represents the portion of a company’s shares that are available to foreign investors under local ownership restrictions or foreign investment limits. This adjustment helps reflect investable market size.

Nevertheless, MSCI is now receiving feedback from stakeholders until 31st December 2025, with the results to be announced on or before 30th January 2026. Implementation, if any, is scheduled in May 2026.

## **Impact on Indonesian stocks**

If implemented, either option is negative for the overall equity market, affecting conglomerate stocks in terms of potential index inclusions, and more importantly, fundamental large-cap stocks given their size and existing positions in MSCI.

Option 1 is stricter and results in larger potential net outflows. BBCA, AMMN and BBRI are projected to see downward adjustments to their FIFs, impacting their market caps by around $7 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.5 billion, respectively.

Meanwhile, Option 2 is less restrictive but still negative, with AMMN, BBCA, and ASII being the most impacted, reducing their FIF market caps by $2.8 billion, $2.8 billion, and $1 billion, respectively.

In both cases, DSSA appears to benefit as its free float was already heavily discounted. These options may also reduce Indonesia's weighting in MSCI Emerging Markets from currently 1.15% to around 0.8-1%.

Following the MSCI announcement today, the initial market reaction was very negative, dragged IHSG down by as much as -3.8% before closing lower by -1.9%.

This was largely driven by conglomerate stocks, as market participants assumed their potential MSCI inclusions would now be harder to achieve.

Consequently, heightened market volatility is expected over the next week, with a key catalyst in early November when MSCI is set to announce its index rebalancing.

Therefore, the next market direction in the near-term now hinges on whether BREN, as the favourite candidate, will be included in the MSCI rebalancing next month.

Ultimately, the potential adjustment seems to be too punishing for Indonesia, and analysts have suggested that MSCI may refrain from implementing the new methodology, as it has faced resistance from many local stakeholders.

If implemented, it would have a profound impact on Indonesia's market structure and sentiment, though companies would eventually find ways to adapt to the new paradigm.
