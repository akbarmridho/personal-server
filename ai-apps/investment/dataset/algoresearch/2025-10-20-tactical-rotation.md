title: "IHSG: Leverage Trading Selloffs, Tactical Rotation to Defensives?"
---

The Indonesian equity market declined by -4.1% WoW to close at 7,915 after four consecutive weeks of trading near its strong technical resistance level of around 8,200.

Conglomerate complex such as BRPT (-14.7% WoW), MLPT (-37.5% WoW), DSSA (-6.6% WoW), and TPIA (-14.5% WoW) led the selloffs, yet these were minor corrections relative to their strong outperformance so far this year.

This marked the second-worst weekly performance in 2025, behind the -5.2% WoW drawdown seen in Feb-25. Even so, IHSG has rallied substantially by +33% since its low in Apr-25, bringing its year-to-date (YTD) return to +12%.

As reiterated over the past month, we remain “cautious” on IHSG and now expect a potential tactical rotation to defensives, as market participants are likely to play it “safe” and secure profits before the end of the year.

Thus, fundamental stocks (i.e. banks) have attractive risk-reward and entry points at these levels following meaningful YTD underperformance, especially as foreign outflows have likely subsided for now.

Short-term sentiment for fundamental stocks is also positive, supported by new expansionary fiscal policy (i.e. cash handouts in 4Q25), looser monetary conditions, and news of Danantara’s possible entry to the equity market.

Nevertheless, 2026 earnings guidance will be crucial to determine whether these tactical opportunities can turn into momentum-driven upside for large-cap fundamental stocks.

If the overall guidance is weaker than expected and growth catalysts are absent, sideways movements could persist.

Furthermore, the next cycle in the conglomerate complex largely depends on whether a few of them, like BREN and BRMS, will be included in the MSCI index next month, barring any major downside risks.

## **Leverage trading triggered selloffs**

Initially, last week’s selloff was sparked by heightened volatility due to the escalation of the US-China trade war, although this has since eased as we now await the meeting between the two countries in November.

Yet, market volatility was exacerbated by high leverage positions held by retail investors, especially in the conglomerate stocks, which they had accumulated over the past few months.

Broadly speaking, this could be seen from the surge in IHSG’s average daily trading value (ADTV), which jumped significantly to IDR 20.2 trillion (+44% MoM) in Aug-25 and IDR 24 trillion (+19% MoM) in Sep-25.

- By segment, the biggest contribution to the expanding market ADTV during the two-month period came from domestic investors, accounting for 62% and 60% of the total, respectively.

Nominally, retail investors recorded the largest ADTV, reaching IDR 10.1 trillion (+39% MoM, 50% of total) in Aug-25 and IDR 11.8 trillion (+16% MoM, 49% of total) in Sep-25.

Our channel check suggests that most of these flows came from leverage and margin trading, especially among high-net-worth individuals. Some were even using short-term margins (i.e. t+2) that were very risky.

- The last time this occurred was at the peak of trading boom in 2021-22. But even then, the total ADTV in IHSG did not pass the IDR 20 trillion level seen this year, indicating overly leveraged positioning.

Within institutional investors, the largest contributor to market ADTV was financial institutions with trade values of IDR 4.7 trillion (+58% MoM, 23% of total) in Aug-25 and IDR 6 trillion (+29% MoM, 25% of total) in Sep-25.

- These flows were most likely used for refinancing or repurchase (repo) facility by major shareholders within the conglomerate complex to increase market capitalization and liquidity of their stocks.

Moreover, the second driver of institutional ADTV was corporate activity (i.e. buybacks), which reached IDR 2.2 trillion (+98% MoM, 11% of total) in Aug-25 and IDR 2.9 trillion (+29% MoM, 12% of total) in Sep-25.

Other institutional flows such as mutual funds, insurance & pension funds, and brokerages have actually been declining with minimal contributions (<10% of total each) to market ADTV over the past few months.

Ultimately, the selloff was triggered by a combination of market volatility and overleveraged positions that were too concentrated in the conglomerate complex, where sharp price declines led to stop-loss triggers and margin calls though they were not broad-based.

Therefore, conglomerate stocks will likely consolidate in the near term amid positioning clearance until a new catalyst (i.e. MSCI inclusions in Nov-25) sparks another cycle of exuberance, if any.

## **Tactical rotation to defensive plays**

At the moment, there are several positive developments that could create tactical upside for large-cap laggard stocks in the short term, such as:

- The Indonesian government plans to spend IDR 30 trillion in cash handouts for >35 million low-income households to be disbursed in 4Q25. Reducing VAT rate in 2026 is also being considered.

- Danantara indicates a possible entry into the equity market using some of the IDR 16 trillion in allocated funds for capital market investments. It has started to use the funds to purchase government bonds.

- The Indonesian sovereign wealth fund expects that the total dividend received from SOEs to nearly double from IDR 85.5 trillion in 2025 to IDR 165.8 trillion over the next five years, implying a +14% CAGR.

- Another anticipated round of monetary easing as both Bank Indonesia and US Federal Reserve are expected to cut interest rates in 4Q25. The latter is projected to cut 2x at 25bps each in October and December.

Consequently, the risk-reward looks attractive for defensive (and cyclical) plays with potential rotational flows back into fundamentals, namely the banking sector, as the stocks are trading at relatively cheap valuations.

Note that the top 10 biggest underperformers dragging IHSG lower year-to-date include: BBCA (-22.5%), BMRI (-28.9%), BBRI (-14.2%), BBNI (-12.6%), AMRT (-25.3%), GOTO (-21.4%), and ADRO (-32.1%).

Additionally, most of the selling pressure was attributed to foreign investors' net outflows in large-cap banks YTD: BBCA (-IDR32.4tn), BMRI (-IDR18.6tn), BBNI (-IDR4.7tn), and BBRI (-IDR4.2tn).

However, foreign flows are starting to improve where IHSG booked IDR 10.3 trillion in total net foreign inflows from Aug-25 to Oct-25, despite the recent volatility risks in Indonesia like the social unrest in Sep-25.

Thus, the heavy net foreign outflows in the equity market over the past one year, which amounted to IDR 84.6 trillion (or equivalent to around $5.1 billion), appear to have subsided provided there are no major domestic and global downside risks ahead.

In the end, fundamental stocks remain largely influenced by their earnings trajectory, which is lacking clear growth catalysts. Hence, market participants will look into 2026 guidance to see if there are further upsides beyond these tactical opportunities.
