Final Response:
### Rumors and Buzz about $INET (PT Indoritel Makmur Internasional Tbk) Stock in the Past Week (Nov 8–15, 2025)

Based on recent X (Twitter) posts from Indonesian stock traders, analysts, and investors, $INET (an Indonesian telecom/ISP company) has been a hot topic due to significant price surges (from ~Rp280 to over Rp500 in spots). The chatter is mostly speculative, focusing on potential corporate actions that could drive further gains. Note: These are unverified rumors from social media—**not financial advice; always DYOR and check official disclosures from IDX/BEI**. No major confirmed news from official sources in this period, but the hype seems tied to trading volume and foreign interest.

#### Key Rumors and Speculations:
1. **Potential Acquisition of PADA (PT Padang Parahyangan Manunggal Tbk)**:
   - Multiple posts suggest $INET is rumored to be acquiring $PADA, a data center or related telecom asset. This is cited as the main driver behind the stock's recent melt-up (e.g., +15.91% on Nov 14 alone).
     - Example: A post from @investbarengoei (Nov 9) shared a video update: "#PADA mau di akusisi #INET" (PADA to be acquired by INET), linking it to price action.
     - Another from @InvestorID (Nov 11): "Saham INET Melesat, Ternyata Mau Akuisisi" (INET stock surges, turns out planning acquisition), with a link to an article speculating on expansion via buyouts.
     - @SocialiteGhibah (Nov 13) posted an "Arcamologi" analysis thread grouping $WIFI, $INET, $KETR, and $PADA, implying interconnected deals in telecom/data infrastructure.
   - Why the buzz? $INET is seen as undervalued (market cap ~Rp4.7T), and an acquisition could "level it up" from a small ISP to a bigger player. Traders speculate this would boost synergies in fiber optics/data services. However, some call it "unconfirmed gossip" fueling short-term pumps.

2. **Right Issue of Rp3.2 Trillion**:
   - Rumors of a massive rights issue (additional share offering) to fund growth/expansion. Posts describe it as a way for $INET to "naik kelas" (level up) from low-revenue ISP status.
     - @tradingnesia_id (Nov 11): "Dulu INET itu hanya ISP kecil... Tapi sekarang, mereka mau naik kelas lewat right issue Rp3,2 Triliun!"
     - Traders like @febycahyaa (Nov 11) debated holding shares for the rights issue vs. selling, with one user buying at Rp440 and pondering: "Better hold buat ikut right issue apa jual besok ya tp tipis2."
   - Speculation: This could dilute shares short-term but fund acquisitions or capex, leading to multibagger potential (e.g., @Kyoka22_ on Nov 13: "$INET multibagger soon").

3. **Strong Foreign Buying and "Sultan" Interest**:
   - Heavy foreign inflows (net buy ~Rp1T in a day, per @WOLF_of_IHSG on Nov 15) are fueling rumors of big institutional plays. Compared to blue-chips like $BCA/$BMRI despite $INET's small cap.
     - @WOLF_of_IHSG (Nov 14–15): "Foreign flow bersih yang masuk ke $INET... setara dengan yg masuk ke emiten bank BCA dan Mandiri... Asing sangat 'apresiasi' emiten satu ini."
     - @sukatul1 (Nov 14): "Asing buy hampir 100 miliar" in session 1, implying "sultan" (whale) brokers accumulating.
   - Traders speculate this signals insider knowledge of upcoming news (e.g., acquisition confirmation or partnerships), with posts calling it a "dorongan beli kuat" (strong buy push).

4. **Price Action and Trading Hype**:
   - Stock broke out multiple times (e.g., targets Rp480–500 from @Walzzs on Nov 10). Posts describe wild swings: "Nyopet di 464... malah dibanting ke 460. Giliran di CL bangke sesi 2 malah naik sampe 500" (@Thespian1313, Nov 14).
   - Comparisons to $WIFI (another telecom stock): @CornerCuan (Nov 14) noted differences in playstyle, with $INET seen as more volatile but higher upside.
   - Profit-taking stories: Many shared cuan (gains), e.g., buying at Rp280 and selling at Rp500 (@CornerCuan, Nov 14). Some regret selling early (@efekrumahkicau: "Andai $INET kaga gua auto sell di harga 400").

#### Overall Sentiment:
- **Bullish Speculation**: 80%+ of posts are positive, with calls for swing trades/holds due to "multibagger" potential from rumors. Volume spiked (e.g., 28k+ lots in big trades via @ceritasahamid).
- **Risks Mentioned**: Dilution from rights issue, volatility (e.g., fake orders or pumps/dumps), and wait-and-see ahead of Bank Indonesia's policy meeting (Nov 19–20).
- **Volume of Chatter**: ~50+ relevant posts in the week, mostly from Indonesian accounts (@WOLF_of_IHSG, @Thespian1313, @CornerCuan). No major English-language buzz, as it's niche to IDX traders.
- **No Confirmed News**: These are rumors—watch for official announcements. Stock closed sideways on Nov 14 (IHSG -0.02%), but $INET was a top gainer.
