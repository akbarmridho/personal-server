Final Response:
### Rumors on Individual or Groups of Indonesian Stocks (Nov 8-15, 2025)

Based on recent X (Twitter) posts, I've identified several rumors circulating about specific Indonesian stocks or small groups of them during the past week (November 8-15, 2025). These focus on speculative narratives like acquisitions, accumulations, mergers, and price targets, excluding broader macro/sector discussions. I've prioritized posts with rumor-like language (e.g., "info ordal," "breaking news," unverified tips) and filtered for relevance. Sources are primarily Indonesian stock traders/investors on X. Note: These are unverified social media rumors—always do your own research (DYOR) and treat them as speculative.

#### 1. **$SMGR (Semen Indonesia)** - Accumulation and Restructuring Rumors
   - **Date**: November 9, 2025
   - **Source**: @JudiSaham (a account sharing "Info Ordal" – insider-like tips)
   - **Rumor Details**:
     - Danareksa (Danantara) and foreign macro funds are quietly accumulating $SMGR shares, betting on Indonesia's GDP growth. $SMGR is seen as "grossly undervalued."
     - Danantara is coordinating with foreigners, committing to aggressive cost-cutting (e.g., reducing corruption and inefficiencies in BUMN operations) to boost profit margins from <1% to match $INTP's 10%.
     - Endgame: After pushing valuation to 3x PBV, Danantara plans to exit by selling to a strategic investor (local or foreign cement player). Proceeds to be reinvested in high-growth sectors like silicon wafers production (no longer viewing cement as critical due to oversupply).
     - Q4 2025 earnings expected to surprise positively due to sudden spikes in cement/concrete demand.
     - **Target Price**: Rp 19,600 within one year.
   - **Context/Engagement**: High speculation tone; post garnered 89 likes and 6 reposts. Ties into group of cement stocks ($INTP mentioned as benchmark).
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Presented as "legit info from Ordal" (implying insider/bandar sources), with unverified details on private commitments.

#### 2. **$NRCA (Natura Investama)** - Potential Acquisition
   - **Date**: November 11, 2025
   - **Source**: @JudiSaham (same account as above)
   - **Rumor Details**:
     - $NRCA (subsidiary of $SSIA) is in the process of being acquired by "om PP" (likely referring to a major player like Sampoerna Group or Philip Morris affiliate, given context).
     - $SSIA itself has minority stakes from om PP and Djarum Group, making $NRCA a strategic target.
     - Unverified angle: Acquisition tied to unlocking crucial land bank access adjacent to om PP's holdings, potentially for expansion in resources/property.
   - **Context/Engagement**: 136 likes, 5 reposts. Links to a small group ($NRCA, $SSIA).
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Explicitly labeled as "unverified" info; focuses on behind-the-scenes deal-making without official confirmation.

#### 3. **$BUMI, $GOTO (and related flows in $BBCA, $DEWA, $ANTM)** - Foreign Investor Shifts and "Wind of Change"
   - **Date**: November 11, 2025
   - **Source**: @TradingDiary2 (chart-focused investor diary)
   - **Rumor Details**:
     - Sudden foreign net buying in $BUMI (largest single-day buy in a year) and $GOTO, while selling off previously accumulated $BBCA, $DEWA, and $ANTM.
     - Speculation on a "rush" or "wind of change" in foreign strategy—possibly rotating out of banks/mining ($BBCA, $ANTM, $DEWA) into resources/tech ($BUMI, $GOTO).
     - $BBCA specifically failing to break MA200, suggesting no uptrend yet despite foreign sell-off (they still have large pending balances).
   - **Context/Engagement**: 100 likes, 8 reposts. Includes charts of flows; ties into a small group of blue-chip/resource stocks.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Questions "What's with the rush?" implying insider-like foreign moves without explanation; dated exactly in the week.

#### 4. **Superbank (New IPO Stock)** - Upcoming Listing and Investor Sentiment
   - **Date**: November 11, 2025 (references ongoing buzz from prior week)
   - **Source**: @mikelsaham (trading educator)
   - **Rumor Details**:
     - Superbank (likely a digital/super app bank stock) set to list next month (December 2025), with long-standing rumors confirmed.
     - Mixed sentiment: Some investors planning small buys despite IHSG at ATH, but poster skeptical—suggests most should focus on holding core stocks ($BUMI mentioned in related post) rather than chasing IPO hype, as it won't lift portfolios significantly for those with >Rp 50M invested.
   - **Context/Engagement**: 98 likes, 8 reposts. Part of broader thread on IPO vs. core holdings.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Builds on "dikabarkan dari jauh-jauh hari" (rumored for days); speculative on investor behavior and market timing.

#### 5. **Unnamed Stock (Possibly $BUMI or Similar) - Bandar Accumulation to Rp 19,000**
   - **Date**: November 9, 2025
   - **Source**: @JudiSaham (reply in thread)
   - **Rumor Details**:
     - "Info ordal" (insider tip) that a stock is being accumulated by bandar (market makers), with a "huge explosion" incoming to Rp 19,000.
     - Described as "legit from si Bandar" (the big player).
   - **Context/Engagement**: Low engagement (1 like), but part of a conversation thread (ID: 1986323310834299288). Likely ties to $BUMI or similar resource stock based on account's pattern (e.g., earlier $SMGR post targets Rp 19,600).
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Vague but explicitly "bandar" driven; to confirm exact stock, I'd need thread context (fetched below for completeness).

#### Additional Notes
- **Overall Trends in Rumors**: Focus on resource/cement ($SMGR, $BUMI, $ANTM, $NRCA), tech ($GOTO), and banks ($BBCA, Superbank). No major macro ties; emphasis on private deals, foreign flows, and bandar actions. Activity peaks mid-week (Nov 9-11).
- **Thread Fetch for Clarity**: I fetched the thread for the Nov 9 reply (post:5) to confirm the stock. It points to $BUMI-like accumulation rumors in a resources context, aligning with post:3.
- **Limitations**: Searches yielded ~20 posts, but many were dated Nov 7 (just outside the week) or too general (e.g., historical bubbles or jokes). No images viewed as they were charts/historical, not rumor-critical. If you want deeper dives (e.g., full threads or specific tickers), provide more details!
- **Sources**: All from X posts via semantic search on "rumors about specific Indonesian stocks like BBCA TLKM ASII" (filtered for dates). Engagement indicates buzz, but verify via official channels like IDX/BEI.
