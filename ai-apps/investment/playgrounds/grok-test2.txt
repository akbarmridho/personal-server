### Summary of Rumors and News on $BUVA (PT Bukit Uluwatu Villa Tbk) from the Past Week (Nov 8–15, 2025)

Based on recent activity on X (formerly Twitter), discussions around $BUVA, an Indonesian real estate/hospitality stock, have been active, primarily driven by speculation about a major investor entry and upcoming corporate actions. The stock has seen mentions of price volatility, with traders eyeing targets around IDR 1,500. Here's a breakdown of key rumors and news from the platform (sourced from latest posts; note that X content often includes unverified speculation, so treat as rumors unless confirmed by official channels like IDX or company disclosures):

#### 1. **Major Rumor: "Mr. X" Enters as Key Shareholder with Plans for Majority Control (Nov 14)**
   - **Source**: High-engagement post by @JudiSaham (a popular Indonesian stock discussion account with 241 likes, 19 reposts).
   - **Details**: A mysterious investor dubbed "Mr. X" (likely a pseudonym for a high-profile figure in Indonesian business/finance) has officially acquired 1.22 billion shares, representing 4.96% of $BUVA's total outstanding shares. This is positioned as the first step in a larger takeover.
     - Follow-up: In Q1 2026, $BUVA is rumored to conduct a "jumbo" rights issue (RI), diluting existing shares significantly. Post-RI, Mr. X's group is expected to emerge as the majority owner with ~70% control.
     - Evidence cited: A screenshot from Bloomberg Terminal, reposted from a Reddit user (u/ZealousidealEnd9111) in an Indonesian stock subreddit. This has fueled buzz about potential restructuring or expansion in $BUVA's villa/resort business.
   - **Context/Impact**: This rumor appears to be driving optimism, with replies speculating on stock pumps. One reply suggested the recent rights offering (BUVA-R) was structured to be "unattractive" (e.g., high exercise price) to facilitate Mr. X's entry without much retail participation. No official confirmation yet, but it's the hottest topic this week.
   - **Stock Reaction**: $BUVA traded around IDR 900–1,000 during the week, up ~6.6% in one tracked session, but below the 1,500 target.

#### 2. **Price Targets and Trading Discussions (Nov 11–13)**
   - **Sources**: Multiple posts from @JudiSaham and others.
     - Nov 13: Acknowledgment that the 1,500 target won't hit this week; "try next week" – seen as a pump signal in trading circles.
     - Nov 12: Debate on buying BUVA-R (rights shares at ~IDR 910 + IDR 150 exercise) vs. direct $BUVA shares (~IDR 955), calling the former less efficient. This ties into RI speculation.
     - Nov 11: Bold call for $BUVA to reach 1,500, with historical comparisons to other stocks like $SGRO.
   - **Sentiment**: Bullish among retail traders, with mentions of $BUVA outperforming the IHSG (+20% broader index context). Some frustration over short-term dips.

#### 3. **Other Minor Mentions**
   - Nov 12: @embahjsx highlighted $BUVA as a "saham cantik" (beautiful stock) in a performance roundup, noting +6.6% gains alongside $GGRM.
   - Nov 9–8: Casual chats about long-term gains (e.g., "If you invested IDR 10M when $BUVA was under 500, imagine now"), but no new rumors.
   - No major negative news; focus is on upside potential from the investor rumor.

#### Overall Sentiment and Caveats
- **Positive Buzz**: The "Mr. X" story dominates, potentially signaling a turnaround for $BUVA (which has been volatile post-IPO). Volume and engagement spiked on Nov 14.
- **Rumors vs. Facts**: These are social media-driven; cross-check with official sources like the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), $BUVA's announcements, or Bloomberg for verification. No mainstream news outlets (e.g., CNBC Indonesia) were directly referenced in these posts.
- **Broader Context**: $BUVA operates in Bali's luxury villa market. Recent RI and investor talks could relate to expansion amid Indonesia's tourism recovery.
