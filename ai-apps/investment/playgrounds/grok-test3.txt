Final Response:
### Rumors Related to Indonesia Stock Market and Indonesian Stocks

Based on a search of recent X (Twitter) posts (focusing on November 2025 activity, as the current date is November 15, 2025), I've identified several discussions that appear to be rumors or speculative insights about the Indonesian stock market (IDX/IHSG) and specific Indonesian stocks. These come from influential handles in the Indonesian finance and stock trading community, such as @JudiSaham (known for "insider-like" tips), @profesor_saham (popular for market analysis), @TradingDiary2 (chart and flow discussions), and others like @cukhurukuque and @eskepalmilosatu.

**Important Disclaimer**: These are unverified rumors from social media posts—treat them as speculation, not financial advice. Stock markets are volatile, and rumors can be inaccurate or manipulative. Always do your own research (DYOR) and consult reliable sources like IDX, OJK, or official filings. I've filtered for relevance to rumors (e.g., unconfirmed "breaking news," insider tips, or speculative flows) and excluded non-rumor content like historical facts or jokes.

#### 1. **Rumors Around $SMGR (Semen Indonesia) Accumulation and Danantara's Plans**
   - **Source**: @JudiSaham (Post ID: 1987343591078044045, Nov 9, 2025; 89 likes, 6k views)
   - **Details**: Alleged "Info Ordal" (insider info) claims foreign macro funds are quietly accumulating $SMGR due to its "grossly undervalued" status, betting on Indonesia's GDP growth. Danantara (state fund) is reportedly coordinating as the "Bandar" (market maker), committing to cost-cutting to boost profit margins from <1% to 10% (like rival $INTP). Endgame: Exit at 3x PBV (target price Rp 19,600 within a year) by selling to strategic investors, shifting funds to high-growth sectors like silicon wafers. A follow-up reply (Post ID: 1987411991141695635) reinforces this, calling it "legit from the Bandar" with an explosion to Rp 19,000 expected soon.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Sounds like unverified insider leaks; no official confirmation. $SMGR is in the cement sector, tied to infrastructure boom speculations.
   - **Market Context**: Cement demand allegedly spiking due to late-2025 infrastructure push.

#### 2. **Government Intervention in $GOTO (GoTo Group) and Grab Merger**
   - **Source**: @profesor_saham (Post ID: 1986938672193917062, Nov 7, 2025; 386 likes, 30k views)
   - **Details**: "Breaking News" rumor that the Istana (Presidential Palace) is directly intervening in a potential merger between GoTo ($GOTO) and Grab. State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi reportedly mentioned it's part of a draft regulation to control ojek online (ride-hailing) tariffs. This could reshape the tech/ride-hailing sector amid competition concerns.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Labeled "breaking" but no linked sources; ties into ongoing regulatory talks in Indonesia's gig economy.
   - **Market Context**: $GOTO has been volatile; a merger could boost valuation but face antitrust scrutiny. Related to broader tech stock rumors.

#### 3. **Foreign Investor Flows: Sudden Buying in $BUMI and $GOTO, Selling $BBCA**
   - **Source**: @TradingDiary2 (Post ID: 1988382866187972610, Nov 11, 2025; 100 likes, 19k views)
   - **Details**: Speculation on a "wind of change" with foreigners net buying $BUMI (Bumi Resources, coal/mining) and $GOTO—the largest single-day buy in $BUMI in a year—while selling $BBCA (Bank Central Asia), $DEWA, and $ANTM (Aneka Tambang). Questions the "rush" behind it, noting $BBCA's failure to break MA200 (indicating no uptrend yet). Charts shared suggest potential sector rotation.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Based on observed flows without explanation; implies hidden catalysts like commodity rebounds or policy shifts.
   - **Market Context**: Mining ($BUMI, $ANTM) and banking ($BBCA) are IHSG heavyweights. Ties into rumors of commodity boom and banking sector pressures.

#### 4. **Corporate Duel: Kalla Group vs. Lippo Group**
   - **Source**: @profesor_saham (Post ID: 1986686764623552610, Nov 7, 2025; 1.5k likes, 106k views)
   - **Details**: "Duel terpanas" (hottest duel) between Kalla Group (linked to former VP Jusuf Kalla) and Lippo Group (one of Indonesia's "nine dragons" conglomerates). References a folksy quote, implying a high-stakes business clash, possibly over assets or sectors like property/healthcare (Lippo's strongholds). Images suggest related news clippings.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Framed dramatically without specifics; could impact stocks like $LIPP (Lippo Karawaci) or Kalla-linked firms if it escalates.
   - **Market Context**: Conglomerate battles often ripple through IDX, especially in real estate and healthcare amid economic recovery talks.

#### 5. **Ongoing Investigation or Probe (Unspecified Stock/Sector)**
   - **Source**: @cukhurukuque (Post ID: 1986791783607722468, Nov 7, 2025; 373 likes, 42k views)
   - **Details**: Teasing a "penelusuran" (investigation) from 4 months ago, with an image (likely a document or chart). Implies something uncovered that readers "won't believe," possibly tied to market irregularities or corporate governance in Indonesian stocks.
   - **Why a Rumor?**: Vague and teaser-style; no details, but builds hype around potential scandal.
   - **Market Context**: Could relate to broader IDX transparency issues or specific stocks (e.g., BUMN or blue-chips).

#### Additional Observations
- **Themes**: Rumors cluster around state involvement (Danantara, Istana), foreign flows, and corporate battles—common in Indonesia's market due to heavy BUMN (state-owned) influence and commodity/tech sectors. No major IHSG-wide crash rumors, but speculation on rotations (e.g., mining up, banking down).
- **Handles Involved**: These come from active Indonesian stock influencers. I initially searched users like @IDNFinancials, @BisnisIndo, @Stockbit, @CNBCIndonesia, and @InvestorDaily, but semantic relevance pulled in these more discussion-heavy accounts. If you meant specific handles, provide them for a refined search.
- **Date Filter**: All posts from early November 2025 (post-2025 Q3 earnings season), suggesting fresh speculation ahead of year-end.
- **No Visuals Analyzed**: Some posts have images/charts (e.g., flows or news clips); if needed, I can fetch details on specific URLs.

If this isn't what you meant (e.g., specific handles or more details), clarify, and I'll refine the search! Remember, rumors can move markets—verify with official sources.
