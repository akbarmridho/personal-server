# The "Ta Cuan" Checklist

The Mandarin word "cuan" is often heard and spoken by many business people and capital market investors in Indonesia. This is because "cuan" means "profit," which is the main goal for every investor in the Indonesian capital market.

Unlike the usual meaning of "cuan," this book will guide investors on how to perform a more thorough stock analysis from various perspectives to get "Ta Cuan" in the Indonesian capital market. "Ta Cuan" comes from two Mandarin words: "Ta," meaning "big," and "Cuan," meaning "profit." Therefore, this book aims to share how investors can analyze stocks more thoroughly to get a bigger profit.

"Ta Cuan" also serves as an acronym for the various factors that investors should consider to get maximum profit. This is The "Ta Cuan" Checklist:

* The Management
* Annual Report
* Candle Stick Pattern
* Universe of Support & Resistance
* Accumulation & Distribution
* Name of Stock Brokers

## 1. The Management

In fundamental analysis, company management is the most important factor because they are the navigators of a company. As good as a company's financial report may be, without competent management, it will become a ticking time bomb. It is necessary to know who the management team is, what their background is, whether they have ever been involved in legal cases, and if they apply Good Corporate Governance (GCG) well.

## 2. Annual Report

The Annual Report is an inseparable part of investment decision-making. It's like a sacred book for shareholders. In it, you can find the company's profile, financial performance over the last few years, business processes, future prospects, current challenges, and so on. By reading the Annual Report, we will better understand which company to invest in.

## 3. Candle Stick Pattern

In the Candle Stick Pattern factor, investors are advised to be able to distinguish the characteristics of various patterns, which broadly consist of three types: UpTrend, DownTrend, and Sideway. Investors are also advised to understand what buy and sell decisions to make when facing various stocks with their own price movement patterns.

## 4. Universe of Support & Resistance

For the Support & Resistance factor, investors are expected to be able to draw Support & Resistance lines that will form the Price Channel of various stock movement patterns to determine the buy and sell points of a stock. Additionally, investors should be able to recognize several reversal patterns, which can be depicted through a candlestick. These stock price reversal patterns are divided into two types: Bullish Reversal and Bearish Reversal patterns.

## 5. Accumulation & Distribution

In terms of accumulation and distribution, investors are invited to distinguish between accumulation and distribution patterns that can occur at the support or resistance levels of a stock's movement pattern. This step is very useful for detecting when a "stock dealer" or large investor starts to accumulate or sell a stock.

## 6. Name of Stock Brokers

From the perspective of broker names, investors are advised to recognize and memorize the codes of several foreign and local brokers who usually act as an extension of large investors in the capital market.

After you understand the six factors of The "Ta Cuan" Checklist, it's a good idea to analyze a stock using this method before making a buy or sell decision. The more checklist factors your target stock meets, the greater your chance of getting "Ta Cuan" or a large profit from that stock. The document provides a case study using BSDE and INDF stocks to demonstrate how to apply The "Ta Cuan" Checklist.
