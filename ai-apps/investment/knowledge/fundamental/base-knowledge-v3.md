# Fundamental Analysis for the Indonesian Market

## Introduction

Fundamental analysis is the process of evaluating a company‚Äôs **financial health, intrinsic value, and long-term growth prospects**. It‚Äôs like checking the physical and behavioral characteristics of a cow to see if it's healthy before you buy it. üêÆ Unlike technical analysis, which focuses on stock price charts, fundamental analysis digs into the **real performance of the business**.

In the context of the **Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI)**, investors often combine global valuation methods with local market realities, such as **dividend yield**, **Price-to-Book Value (PBV)**, and the impact of **commodity cycles** on key sectors.

The goal is to answer two big questions:

1. Is the company fundamentally strong and sustainable?
2. Is the current stock price undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued relative to its intrinsic worth?

## 1. Core Elements of Company Health

These are the key indicators to check when assessing a company's overall condition.

* **Profitability (Laba Bersih):** A company that consistently generates net profit shows resilience. Growth in earnings over time is a very positive sign.
* **Margins (Margin Laba):**
  * **Gross Profit Margin** ‚Üí Measures efficiency in production.
  * **Net Profit Margin** ‚Üí Indicates overall business efficiency after all costs.
  * Indonesian analysts usually benchmark margins within the same sector, as different industries have different average levels.
* **Cash Flow (Arus Kas):** Operating cash flow should ideally be positive and aligned with net income. A company can be profitable on paper but have negative cash flow, meaning it isn't generating real cash from its operations. Strong operating cash flow indicates high-quality earnings.
* **Equity (Ekuitas):** Represents the book value or net assets of the company. Consistently growing equity means management is successfully creating shareholder value.
* **Debt (Utang):** Debt is a double-edged sword. Reasonable debt can fuel expansion, but excessive debt increases financial risk. The **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER)** is a crucial metric to watch.
* **Dividend Policy (Kebijakan Dividen):** A consistent dividend payout signals stability and shareholder friendliness. However, a company must also retain earnings (laba ditahan) to reinvest for future growth. A good company balances both.
* **Management Quality (Manajemen):** Arguably the most important factor. Financial metrics mean little without a competent, honest, and transparent management team. In Indonesia, the reputation of the management is a major consideration for investors.

## 2. Key Financial Statements

All the data for analysis comes from these four reports:

1. **Income Statement (Laporan Laba Rugi):** Shows revenues, expenses, and the final net profit (laba bersih) over a period.
2. **Balance Sheet (Neraca):** A snapshot of a company's financial position, showing Assets (Aset), Liabilities (Liabilitas), and Equity (Ekuitas). The core formula is: **Aset = Liabilitas + Ekuitas**.
3. **Cash Flow Statement (Laporan Arus Kas):** Tracks all cash movements from operations, investments, and financing activities.
4. **Statement of Changes in Equity (Laporan Perubahan Ekuitas):** Details changes in shareholder capital, including from retained earnings and dividend payments.

## 3. Financial Ratios: The Analyst's Toolkit

### A. Profitability Ratios (Kemampuan Menghasilkan Laba)

* **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit √∑ Revenue**
  * **Benchmark:** A GPM of **30% or more** is generally considered good.
* **Net Profit Margin = Net Profit √∑ Revenue**
  * **Benchmark:** A good NPM benchmark is **10%**.
* **ROE (Return on Equity) = Net Profit √∑ Equity**
  * Measures how effectively a company uses shareholder money to generate profit.
  * **Benchmark:** In Indonesia, an ROE **above 15%** is considered excellent, especially for banks.
* **ROA (Return on Assets) = Net Profit √∑ Total Assets**
  * Measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.
  * **Benchmark:** An ROA **over 10%** is considered strong, though this can be sector-dependent.

### B. Solvency Ratios (Kemampuan Membayar Utang Jangka Panjang)

* **DER (Debt-to-Equity Ratio) = Total Debt √∑ Equity**
  * **Benchmark:** A DER **below 1.0x** is often seen as safe, as it means equity is greater than debt.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT √∑ Interest Expense**
  * Shows if a company can easily pay the interest on its debt.
  * **Benchmark:** A ratio **greater than 1.5x** is considered safe.

### C. Liquidity Ratios (Kemampuan Membayar Utang Jangka Pendek)

* **Current Ratio = Current Assets √∑ Current Liabilities**
  * **Benchmark:** A ratio **over 100% (or 1.0x)** is considered safe.
* **Cash Ratio = Cash & Cash Equivalents √∑ Current Liabilities**
  * A stricter test of liquidity.
  * **Benchmark:** A ratio **above 30% (or 0.3x)** is generally acceptable.

## 4. Valuation Multiples: Is the Stock Cheap or Expensive?

These multiples help determine a stock's price relative to its earnings, assets, or peers.

### A. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER)

* **Formula:** **Stock Price √∑ EPS (Earnings per Share)**
* A low PER could mean the stock is undervalued. A high PER suggests the market expects strong future growth.
* In the BEI, blue-chip banks often trade at a higher PER compared to more cyclical commodity stocks. A general rule of thumb for a "cheap" stock is a PER of **less than 10.0x**.

### B. Price-to-Book Value (PBV)

* **Formula:** **Stock Price √∑ BVPS (Book Value per Share)**
* A PBV below 1.0x means the stock is trading for less than its book value, which may indicate it's undervalued.
* This ratio is widely used in the Indonesian banking sector (e.g., comparing BBCA vs. BBRI). A general rule of thumb is a PBV of **less than 2.0x**, but this is only attractive if ROE is high.

### C. Dividend Yield (DY)

* **Formula:** **(Dividend per Share √∑ Stock Price) x 100%**
* A high dividend yield (e.g., 5-8%) is attractive for income investors. Companies like TLKM and UNVR are known for consistent dividends.
* **Caution:** A high yield could also be a red flag if it's caused by a steep drop in the stock price.

### D. EV/EBITDA

* **Formula:** **(Market Cap + Debt ‚Äì Cash) √∑ EBITDA**
* This is useful for comparing companies with different debt levels and tax rates, especially in sectors with high capital expenditure like telecom and mining. An EV/EBITDA **below 10x** is often considered attractive.

## 5. Intrinsic Value & Margin of Safety

### Estimating Intrinsic Value (Simplified Method)

Intrinsic value is the "true" worth of a stock based on its fundamentals. Here‚Äôs a simple way to estimate it:

1. Find the net profit for the past five years and calculate the average growth rate (CAGR).
2. Use this CAGR to forecast the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the next five years.
3. Calculate the total accumulated EPS over those five years.
4. Discount this total future EPS back to its **Present Value** using a discount rate (e.g., the BI Rate + a risk premium).
5. Add this Present Value to the current **Book Value per Share (BVPS)**.

**Example Calculation:**

* Present Value of accumulated 5-year future EPS = **Rp 1,930**
* Current Book Value per Share (BVPS) = **Rp 3,828**
* **Estimated Intrinsic Value** = Rp 1,930 + Rp 3,828 = **Rp 5,758**

### Margin of Safety (MoS)

The Margin of Safety is a principle, popularized by Benjamin Graham, that you should only buy a stock when its market price is significantly below its intrinsic value. This provides a buffer against errors in judgment or bad luck.

* **Formula:** $MoS = \frac{(Intrinsic\;Value - Market\;Price)}{Intrinsic\;Value} \times 100\%$
* A higher MoS provides more room for error. Value investors in Indonesia, like Lo Kheng Hong, emphasize buying only with a sufficient MoS.

**Example Calculation:**

* Intrinsic Value = **Rp 5,758**
* Current Market Price = **Rp 6,600**
* **MoS** = (5,758 - 6,600) / 5,758 = **-14.6%**. A negative MoS indicates the stock is currently **overvalued**.

## 6. Comparative Analysis (Peer & Historical)

Valuation numbers are meaningless in isolation. Context is key.

* **Peer Comparison:** Compare PER, PBV, ROE, and dividend yield with similar companies in the same sector (e.g., BBCA vs. BBRI vs. BMRI vs. BBNI).
* **Historical Comparison:** Compare a company's current ratios with its own 3-5 year averages. If a company's average PBV is 2.5x but it currently trades at 1.8x, it might be historically undervalued.
* **Market Benchmark:** Compare the stock's performance and multiples to sector indices (e.g., IDXFINANCE, IDXENERGY).

## 7. Macroeconomic & Industry Factors

Even the strongest company can be affected by the broader economy. For Indonesian stocks, these factors are critical:

* **BI Rate (Suku Bunga BI):** Higher rates can hurt companies with large debts and negatively impact bank profitability.
* **Inflation (Inflasi):** Affects consumer purchasing power and company operating costs.
* **Exchange Rate (Kurs Rupiah/USD):** A weak Rupiah benefits exporters but hurts importers who rely on foreign raw materials.
* **Commodity Prices (Harga Komoditas):** The prices of coal, CPO, nickel, and oil heavily influence the earnings of many companies listed on the BEI.
* **Government Policy & Regulation:** Changes in subsidies, taxes, or trade restrictions can dramatically impact a sector's outlook.
