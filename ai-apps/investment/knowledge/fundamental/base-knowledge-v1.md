# Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis is a method used by investors to evaluate a company's health and determine if a stock is a good investment. It's like checking the physical and behavioral characteristics of a cow to see if it's healthy.

## Key Indicators of a Healthy Company

When performing a fundamental analysis of a company, you should look at several key indicators:

* **Profit (Laba):** A profitable company is generally a better investment than one that is losing money. Consistent and growing profits are a very good sign.
* **Profit Margin (Margin Laba):** This is the ratio of profit to revenue. A large profit margin indicates the company has a strong competitive advantage and can control its expenses.
* **Cash Flow (Arus Kas):** Unlike profit, which is based on an accounting method, cash flow is based on actual cash. A company can be profitable on paper but have negative cash flow, which indicates it's not generating strong operating cash. It's better to invest in a company with both positive profit and positive operating cash flow.
* **Equity (Ekuitas):** This represents a company's net assets after liabilities are deducted. A company with consistently growing equity is more likely to have growing profits in the future.
* **Debt (Utang):** While debt can help a company grow, excessive debt can be a liability. Investors need to check if a company has the ability to pay off its debts, as a company can fail if its debt is too high.
* **Dividends vs. Retained Earnings (Laba Ditahan):** Dividends are a portion of profit distributed to shareholders. A company that regularly pays dividends shows it is shareholder-oriented. However, if a company pays out too much in dividends, it limits its future growth potential. It's important for a company to balance dividends with retained earnings, which can lead to future profit growth.
* **Management (Manajemen):** This is arguably the most important factor. A competent and honest management team is crucial for a company's success, regardless of its financial ratios.

## Financial Statements

There are four types of financial statements that are crucial for fundamental analysis:

* **Income Statement (Laporan Laba Rugi):** This statement summarizes a company's income and expenses over a specific period, showing its net profit or loss. It helps investors determine if a company is profitable and analyze trends in sales and profits.
* **Balance Sheet (Laporan Neraca):** This statement shows a company's total assets, liabilities, and equity. The fundamental equation for the balance sheet is: Aset = Liabilitas + Ekuitas. Analyzing the balance sheet helps investors determine if a company has a healthy financial position.
* **Cash Flow Statement (Laporan Arus Kas):** This report details the cash coming in and going out of a company from its operating, investing, and financing activities. It is different from an income statement because it is based on cash transactions, not accounting-based profits. A positive operating cash flow indicates good cash management.
* **Statement of Changes in Equity (Laporan Perubahan Kepemilikan Modal):** This statement details the changes in a company's equity over time.

## Key Ratios for Analysis

While there are dozens of financial ratios, not all are used for investment decisions. The following are some fundamental ratios frequently used by investors:

### Profitability Ratios

These ratios measure a company's ability to generate a profit.

* **Gross Profit Margin:** Compares gross profit to total revenue to see if there are issues with the cost of goods sold. A gross profit margin of 30% or more is generally considered good.
* **Net Profit Margin:** Compares net profit to total sales to measure overall profitability after all expenses. A good benchmark is 10%.
* **Return on Equity (ROE):** Measures a company's ability to generate profit from its shareholders' equity. A higher ROE means the company is better at generating profit from its equity. An ROE of over 15% is considered optimal for providing a return to shareholders.
* **Return on Assets (ROA):** Measures a company's ability to generate profit from its total assets. A higher ROA indicates a better ability to convert assets into profit. An ROA over 10% is considered good.

### Solvency Ratios

These ratios measure a company's ability to pay off its long-term debt.

* **Debt to Equity Ratio (DER):** Compares a company's total liabilities to its shareholders' equity. A DER of less than 1.0x is a good indicator that a company can pay its debts, as it means its equity is greater than its liabilities.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Measures a company's ability to pay the interest on its debt. A ratio greater than 1.5x is considered safe.

### Liquidity Ratios

These ratios are similar to solvency ratios but specifically measure a company's ability to pay off its short-term debt using its current assets.

* **Current Ratio:** Measures a company's ability to pay short-term liabilities with its current assets (cash, receivables, etc.). A ratio over 100% is considered safe, meaning current assets are at least equal to short-term liabilities.
* **Cash Ratio:** This is a stricter ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term liabilities using only its cash and cash equivalents. A ratio over 30% is considered safe.

## Valuing a Stock

To determine if a stock's price is "cheap" or "expensive," investors typically use two key indicators:

### Price to Earnings Ratio (PER)

Before calculating the PER, you must first calculate **Earnings per Share (EPS)**, which is the company's net profit over a year divided by the number of shares outstanding. A positive EPS indicates the company is profitable, while a negative EPS means it is at a loss.

The Price to Earnings Ratio is calculated by dividing the stock price by the EPS. Because the stock price changes daily, the PER also changes daily.

### Price to Book Value (PBV)

To calculate the PBV, you first need to determine the **Book Value per Share (BVPS)**, which is a company's equity per share. BVPS is calculated by dividing a company's total equity by the number of outstanding shares. A negative BVPS means the company has a capital deficiency. The PBV is then calculated by dividing the stock's price by the BVPS.

A common rule of thumb for a cheap stock is a PER of less than 10.0x and a PBV of less than 2.0x. However, these are not fixed rules as they can vary by industry.

You can also compare a company's valuation to others in the same industry and to its own valuation in previous years to see if it is undervalued. For example, if a company's PBV is currently 2.0x, but its historical PBV has been between 2.0x and 3.0x, it can be considered undervalued.

## Intrinsic Value

The intrinsic value is the "fair value" or true worth of a company or stock, determined by fundamental analysis, not by its market price. A stock is considered **undervalued** if its market price is significantly below its intrinsic value, and **overvalued** if the price is above its intrinsic value.

A simple way to calculate a stock's intrinsic value is as follows:

1. Find the historical net profit for the past five years and calculate the average growth rate (CAGR).
2. Use the CAGR to estimate the EPS for the next five years (Future Value).
3. Calculate the accumulated EPS for those five years.
4. Calculate the Present Value by applying a discount rate (for example, inflation).
5. Add the Present Value of the accumulated EPS to the current Book Value per Share (BVPS).

For example, if a stock's accumulated five-year EPS (Present Value) is Rp1,930 and its BVPS is Rp3,828, its intrinsic value would be Rp5,758.

## Margin of Safety (MoS)

The Margin of Safety is a principle in investing that suggests you should only buy a stock when its market price is significantly below its intrinsic value. It is calculated as:

$$MoS = \frac{(Intrinsic\;Value - Stock\;Price)}{Intrinsic\;Value} \times 100\%$$

For example, if a stock's intrinsic value is Rp5,758 and its market price is Rp6,600, the MoS is -11%, indicating that the price is higher than its intrinsic value.te: 190].
