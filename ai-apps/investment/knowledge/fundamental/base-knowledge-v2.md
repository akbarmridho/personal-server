# Fundamental Analysis

## Introduction

Fundamental analysis is the process of evaluating a company’s **financial health, intrinsic value, and long-term growth prospects**. Unlike technical analysis, which focuses on price and volume, fundamental analysis digs into the **real performance of the business**.
In the context of **Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI)**, investors often combine global valuation methods with local market realities, such as **dividen yield**, **PBV**, and the impact of **commodity cycles** on sectors like banking, energy, and telecommunications.

The goal is to answer two big questions:

1. Is the company fundamentally strong and sustainable?
2. Is the current stock price undervalued, fairly valued, or overvalued relative to its intrinsic worth?

## 1. Core Elements of Company Health

* **Profitability (Laba Bersih):** A company that consistently generates net profit (laba bersih) shows resilience. Growth in earnings over time is a positive sign.
* **Margins (Margin Laba):**

  * Gross Profit Margin → measures efficiency in production.
  * Net Profit Margin → indicates overall efficiency.
    Indonesian analysts usually benchmark margins within the same sector because industries have different average levels.
* **Cash Flow (Arus Kas):** Operating cash flow should ideally be positive and aligned with net income. Strong operating cash flow = high quality of earnings.
* **Equity (Ekuitas):** Represents the book value of the company. Growing equity means management is creating shareholder value.
* **Debt (Utang):** Debt is a double-edged sword. Reasonable debt can fuel expansion, but excessive debt increases financial risk. The **Debt-to-Equity Ratio (DER)** is widely used in Indonesia.
* **Dividend Policy (Kebijakan Dividen):** A consistent dividend payout signals stability and shareholder friendliness. However, retaining earnings (laba ditahan) for reinvestment can also be attractive if it leads to future growth.
* **Management Quality (Manajemen):** Financial metrics mean little without competent and trustworthy management. In Indonesia, governance, transparency, and reputation of management teams are major considerations.

## 2. Key Financial Statements

1. **Income Statement (Laporan Laba Rugi):** Shows revenues, expenses, and net profit (laba bersih).
2. **Balance Sheet (Neraca):** Assets (Aset), Liabilities (Liabilitas), and Equity (Ekuitas). Formula: Aset = Liabilitas + Ekuitas.
3. **Cash Flow Statement (Laporan Arus Kas):** Tracks cash movements from operations, investments, and financing.
4. **Statement of Changes in Equity (Laporan Perubahan Ekuitas):** Shows changes in shareholder capital, including dividends and retained earnings.

## 3. Financial Ratios

### A. Profitability Ratios

* **Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit ÷ Revenue**
* **Net Profit Margin = Net Profit ÷ Revenue**
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** Net Profit ÷ Equity. In Indonesia, ROE above 15% is considered excellent (especially for banks).
* **ROA (Return on Assets):** Net Profit ÷ Total Assets. ROA above 10% is strong, though sector-dependent.

### B. Solvency Ratios

* **DER (Debt-to-Equity Ratio) = Debt ÷ Equity.** A DER below 1.0 is often seen as safe.
* **Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT ÷ Interest Expense.** Higher coverage means more ability to service debt.

### C. Liquidity Ratios

* **Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities.** Above 1.0 is safe.
* **Cash Ratio = Cash ÷ Current Liabilities.** Above 0.3 is generally acceptable.

## 4. Valuation Multiples

Valuation multiples help investors determine whether a stock is cheap or expensive relative to its earnings, assets, or peers.

### A. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER)

* **Formula:** Price ÷ EPS (Earnings per Share).
* Low PER → possibly undervalued.
* High PER → expensive, or market expects strong growth.
* In BEI, blue-chip banks often trade at higher PER compared to commodity stocks.

### B. Price-to-Book Value (PBV)

* **Formula:** Price ÷ Book Value per Share (BVPS).
* PBV < 1.0 → stock trades below book value (undervalued).
* PBV > 2.0 → stock is priced at premium, usually justified if ROE is high.
* Widely used in Indonesian banking sector comparisons (e.g., BBCA vs. BBRI).

### C. Dividend Yield (Dividend Yield / DY)

* **Formula:** Dividend per Share ÷ Stock Price.
* High dividend yield (5–8%) is attractive for income investors.
* But if yield is high because price dropped, it could indicate distress.
* In BEI, companies like TLKM and UNVR are known for consistent dividends.

### D. EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value / EBITDA)

* **Formula:** (Market Cap + Debt – Cash) ÷ EBITDA.
* EV/EBITDA < 10 is often considered attractive, but varies by sector.
* Useful in sectors with high capital expenditure like telecom, mining, and infrastructure.

## 5. Intrinsic Value & Margin of Safety

### Intrinsic Value Estimation (Simplified)

1. Look at 5-year historical earnings (laba bersih).
2. Calculate growth rate (CAGR).
3. Forecast EPS for next 5 years.
4. Discount future earnings to present value using discount rate (BI rate + risk premium).
5. Add Book Value per Share (BVPS).

This gives a rough intrinsic value per share.

### Margin of Safety (MoS)

$MoS = \frac{(Intrinsic\;Value - Market\;Price)}{Intrinsic\;Value} \times 100\%$

* A higher MoS = more room for error.
* Classic value investors in Indonesia (like Lo Kheng Hong) emphasize buying only with sufficient MoS.

## 6. Comparative Analysis (Peer & Historical)

Valuation numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. Comparative analysis helps put them into context:

* **Peer Comparison:** Compare PER, PBV, ROE, and dividend yield with similar companies in the same sector. Example: BBCA vs. BBRI vs. BMRI vs. BBNI.
* **Historical Comparison:** Compare current ratios with the company’s own 3–5 year averages. Example: if BBRI’s average PBV is 2.5x but currently trades at 1.8x, it might be undervalued.
* **Market Benchmark:** Compare stock performance and multiples to sector indices (e.g., IDXFINANCE, IDXENERGY).

## 7. Macroeconomic & Industry Factors

Even the strongest company cannot escape macroeconomic pressures. For Indonesian stocks, the following are critical:

* **BI Rate (Suku Bunga BI):** Directly affects borrowing costs and bank profitability.
* **Inflation (Inflasi):** Impacts consumer spending and cost structures.
* **Exchange Rate (Kurs Rupiah/USD):** Exporters benefit from weak rupiah, importers suffer.
* **Commodity Prices (Harga Komoditas):** Coal, CPO, nickel, and oil prices heavily influence listed companies.
* **Government Policy & Regulation:** Subsidies, import/export restrictions, or tax incentives can dramatically shift valuations.
