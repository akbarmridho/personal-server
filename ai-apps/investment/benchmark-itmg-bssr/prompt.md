**Context**
Today’s date: **27 October 2025**

Don't call internet search (general-search, investment-search) as I'm run out of free tier usage.

I am considering an investment in the Indonesian coal & mining sector and have narrowed my options to **ITMG** and **BSSR**. These stocks were shortlisted based on a *Dividend Investing* monthly report that highlights strong fundamentals, attractive dividend yields, and potential upside since their current prices are moving sideways or are below estimated intrinsic value.

My investment objective is **a minimum return of 10% per year**. If the expected return is lower than that, I would prefer to allocate funds to **Reksadana Pendapatan Tetap (RDPT)**, which generally offers 9–10% annually with lower risk than stocks.

**What I want you to analyze**

1. **Which of the two stocks (ITMG or BSSR) is the better investment right now**, based on:

   * Current valuation and price level
   * Fundamental performance (profitability, debt, cash flow, dividend sustainability, etc.)
   * Business and industry outlook (coal price trends, production volume, contracts)
   * Future growth drivers and risks

2. **Macroeconomic considerations**, including:

   * Indonesian and global economic developments in recent months/weeks
   * Energy/coal market dynamics (China demand, global supply, regulations)
   * Market sentiment impacts, including **MSCI free float adjustment** effects on Indonesian stocks

3. **Sector comparison**

   * Relative performance vs. peers and the broader mining sector in Indonesia

**Investment plan details needed**

* Recommended stock to buy (or both with allocation suggestion)
* **Entry price** range
* **Holding period** estimate
* **Stop-loss** level(s)
* **Take-profit** target(s)

**Additional Information**
I will provide more story/context about ITMG and BSSR below for your reference.



## **ITMG – PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk**

PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk (ITMG) is an integrated coal mining company based in Indonesia. Founded in 1987, the company is headquartered in South Jakarta and operates as a subsidiary of Banpu Minerals (Singapore) Pte. Ltd.

### **Business Segments**

ITMG operates through three main segments:

1. **Upstream**

   * Coal mining, blending, and exploration

2. **Energy Services**

   * Supporting services such as coal transportation and logistics

3. **Downstream**

   * Power generation and energy diversification, including initiatives toward renewable energy to support the energy transition

### **Risks to Consider**

* Profitability is highly influenced by coal price fluctuations
* Increasing shift toward renewable energy, which may reduce coal demand in the future

### **Future Outlook**

ITMG is well-known for its strong reputation in energy supply, with the slogan **“Powering Livelihood, Advancing Progress”** and a strong commitment to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) principles.
The company is actively diversifying its business to anticipate the decline in global coal demand due to the energy transition.

In summary, investing in ITMG means investing in fossil energy, but with exposure to renewable energy development as well.

## **BSSR – PT Baramulti Suksessarana Tbk**

PT Baramulti Suksessarana Tbk (BSSR) is a coal mining and trading company in Indonesia. Established in 1990, the company went public on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2012.
BSSR owns coal mining concessions covering a large area, mainly in South and East Kalimantan.

### **Risks to Consider**

* Profitability is heavily influenced by coal market prices
* Growing transition toward renewable energy may reduce coal demand

### **Future Outlook**

Indonesia is known as one of the top coal-producing regions with abundant reserves.
BSSR is considered a solid player in this industry, both financially and operationally.

Like other coal companies, BSSR currently offers an attractive valuation — including favorable book value, P/E ratio, and dividend yield.
However, coal is a traded commodity, so company earnings remain closely tied to coal price movements in the market.

  "result": "This market intelligence brief summarizes the price trends, demand drivers, and supply context for the Indonesian coal market during October 2025.\n\n### **Indonesian Coal Market Brief: October 2025**\n\n#### **1. Overview of October 2025 Price Trends**\n\nThe Indonesian coal market experienced an **upward trend** throughout October 2025, with the government-set reference price showing a significant month-over-month increase.\n\n*   **Benchmark Price Increase:** The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) set Indonesia's Benchmark Coal Price (**Harga Batubara Acuan, or HBA**) for the high-calorific grade (6,322 kcal/kg GAR) at **US$109.74 per ton** for the second half of October 2025 (effective October 16).[1], [2]\n*   **Sequential Rise:** This latest price marked an increase from the US$106.94 per ton set for the first half of October 2025.[1]\n*   **Broad Strength:** Prices for all lower-grade coal also recorded gains, including HBA I (5,300 kcal/kg GAR) rising to US$67.76 per ton and HBA III (3,400 kcal/kg GAR) climbing to US$33.92 per ton for the second half of the month.[1]\n\nThe primary drivers cited for this continued rise in October are **tighter regional supply** and **steady demand from major Asian buyers**, primarily China and India.[1]\n\n#### **2. Key Factors and Cross-Regional Influences**\n\n##### **China Demand: Short-Term Strength and Inventory Drawdown**\n\nChina, the largest export destination for Indonesian coal, is demonstrating strong short-term import demand due to immediate seasonal and supply factors in October 2025:\n\n*   **Winter Demand Spike:** A \"major cold wave\" is approaching, which has boosted heating requirements and driven high daily coal consumption, even in the traditional shoulder season.[3]\n*   **Inventory Depletion:** Daily average coal sales volume for key Chinese enterprises rose by 4.1% week-on-week from October 17–23, 2025. Crucially, total coal inventory (including port stock) had fallen by **18.6% year-on-year** and 5.4% week-on-week as of October 23, 2025.\n*[3]   **Market Forecast:** Analysts expect the supply-demand gap to widen, potentially leading to a second wave of market activity as power plants rush to replenish depleted stock, which supports import prices.\n*[3]   **Structural Demand:** China is still forecasted to import around 330 million tons of coal in 2025, reinforcing its central role in the Asian thermal coal market.\n\n[4]##### **Global Supply and Indonesia's Output**\n\n*   **Tighter Regional Supply:** The rising HBA price is directly attributed to tighter regional supply. This is supported by Indonesian government data showing that the nation's coal output for the first nine months of 2025 (January-September) reached 564.78 million tons, which is **lower** than the production during the same period last year. A[5] general 2025 outlook also projected a volume drop in Indonesian coal output for the full year.\n*[6], [7]   **Indian Demand Outlook:** India remains a significant market, with traders anticipating restocking in the fourth quarter ahead of the important Diwali holiday period. W[1]hile India's overall coal imports in the most recent reported month (August 2025) were marginally down year-on-year, coking coal imports for the steel industry saw a rise.\n\n[8], [2]##### **Macroeconomic Context (2025 Outlook)**\n\nDespite the sharp price increase in October, the broader 2025 outlook remains cautious:\n\n*   **Long-Term Price Pressure:** Earlier in the year, global coal prices were projected to decline throughout 2025 and 2026, primarily due to a slowdown in global economic growth and weakening demand trends in advanced economies, suggesting the October spike is a *short-term demand event*.\n*[9]   **Global Plateau:** The International Energy Agency (IEA) continues to project that global coal demand will remain on a plateau through 2025 and 2026, as structural shifts toward renewables in some regions balance consumption growth in emerging Asian markets.[6]",
