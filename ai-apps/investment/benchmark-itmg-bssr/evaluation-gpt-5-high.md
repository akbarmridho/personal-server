Overview and ranking

Important correction to prior note:

- You clarified that the granular market/technical/broker data (e.g., broker net flows, candlestick patterns, MACD/ADX, SMAs, EV/EBITDA, cash/FCF, peer stats, index moves) were sourced from your tools and provided to the models. I therefore withdraw the prior concern that those specifics were hallucinated and adjust the evaluations accordingly. Unless explicitly contradicted, I now treat those figures as verified. Remaining deductions focus on internal consistency, interpretation quality, and any statements that remain methodologically or factually questionable (e.g., contradictory scoring frameworks, unsupported policy announcements).

Ranked best to worst (based on Technical Accuracy, Analytical Quality, Correctness of Findings):

1) gpt-5-mini
2) gpt-5
3) gemini-2.5-flash
4) deepseek_v3_1
5) kimi-k2-0905
6) qwen3-max
7) gpt-oss-120b

Why this ranking:

- gpt-5-mini and gpt-5 most effectively integrated your verified tool data with sound dividend sustainability analysis (payout ratios vs cash/FCF), free-float/MSCI implications, and actionable plans aligned to the 10% objective. Their conclusions follow logically from the data.
- gemini-2.5-flash is broadly solid but has a notable internal inconsistency (calling ITMG’s valuation less compelling despite showing it cheaper on P/E and P/B). Otherwise, it leveraged your broker/technical data well enough to justify its call.
- deepseek_v3_1 and kimi-k2-0905 rely on your technical/bandarmology data but underweight or inconsistently incorporate dividend sustainability in the decision (especially for ITMG given the elevated TTM payout), weakening the alignment to the 10% objective and the RDPT alternative.
- qwen3-max includes questionable assertions (e.g., named institutional buyers and “limited” MSCI impact despite BSSR’s ~9% free float) and interpretation issues.
- gpt-oss-120b has methodological errors (a scoring total exceeding the maximum) and a likely unfounded MSCI policy claim, which materially impair correctness.

No outputs appear incomplete due to skipped tool calls; where specific time-series technicals, broker flows, and valuation details were cited, I now assume they came from your data tools.

Model-by-model evaluations

— gpt-5-mini —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Correctly integrates your macro brief (HBA up to ~US$109.7/t in Oct-2025, China inventory drawdown/winter demand, Indonesia output softness, IEA plateau). Uses your fundamentals and bandarmology data. Appropriately flags ITMG’s TTM payout ratio (~131%) and contrasts with BSSR’s ~73% payout, discussing sustainability with reference to cash/FCF.
  - No apparent misuse of figures; broker/indicator specifics are acceptable given your clarification.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Strong framework: ties dividend sustainability, cash/FCF, ROE/ROA, free float/MSCI mechanics, and technical accumulation into a coherent allocation (BSSR core 60% / ITMG 40%).
  - Clear risk section and RDPT decision rule; execution plan with tranches, stops, and staged targets aligned to the 10% objective.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Recommending BSSR as core and ITMG as satellite follows from the data (higher ROE and more conservative payout at BSSR vs. higher but potentially less repeatable ITMG TTM yield).
  - The findings properly reflect the supplied data and macro context.

— gpt-5 —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Accurately uses your macro context and the key fundamentals. Properly addresses free-float/MSCI mechanics (ITMG more resilient vs BSSR’s low free float). Recognizes ITMG’s dividend variability while noting net-cash and low EV/EBITDA support.
  - Technical/broker comments are consistent with being based on your tools.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Balanced trade-offs: valuation cushion and liquidity (ITMG) vs higher ROE and accumulation (BSSR). The recommendation of both, with tilt to ITMG as core, is reasoned and consistent with the 10% target and your alternative (RDPT).
  - Concrete entry/stop/targets and 6–12 month horizon; well-structured risks.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Conclusions align with the provided data and your objective. Despite giving BSSR a perfect checklist score, the tilt to ITMG is justified by liquidity/valuation/MSCI considerations.

— gemini-2.5-flash —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Uses your fundamentals, technicals, and broker flows (1W/1M/3M) appropriately under the assumption of tool verification. Incorporates the macro brief correctly.
  - One internal inconsistency: it states ITMG’s valuation is “less compelling” while the table shows ITMG cheaper on both P/E and P/B. If “less compelling” was intended to reflect payout sustainability or growth visibility, it is not explicitly connected.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Clear structure with Ta Cuan mapping, profitability/solvency comparisons, and accumulation analysis. Identifies short-term tailwind/long-term headwind correctly.
  - The valuation inconsistency softens the overall reasoning quality but does not invalidate the core thesis.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Recommends BSSR on superior profitability, near-zero leverage, and 1M accumulation. That is consistent with the data and the near-term coal tailwind; the valuation comment should be amended for internal consistency.

— deepseek_v3_1 —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Integrates your macro brief and presents extensive metrics and technicals consistent with tool-driven data. However, it declares ITMG’s 15%+ yield “sustainable” without acknowledging or quantifying the elevated TTM payout ratio context (you provided ~131%), which is a notable omission.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Comprehensive layout (fundamentals, technicals, bandarmology, valuation). But the core dividend-sustainability trade-off versus RDPT and BSSR’s more conservative payout is underdeveloped.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Favoring ITMG could be reasonable, but calling the 15%+ yield “sustainable” without addressing the payout ratio weakens the conclusion vis-à-vis your 10% objective. Entry/stop plan is fine, but the dividend inference is insufficiently supported.

— kimi-k2-0905 —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Appropriately uses your macro and tool data, including payout ratios (ITMG ~131% vs BSSR ~73%) and broker accumulation. No specific data misuse detected.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Provides Ta Cuan scoring and a full trade plan. However, it recommends ITMG despite acknowledging the elevated ITMG payout ratio and BSSR’s more conservative payout, with limited reconciliation of that risk to your “≥10% with lower risk than stocks” alternative (RDPT).
  - The case leans heavily on accumulation signals and immediate valuation without fully integrating dividend sustainability into the decision.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - The ITMG-over-BSSR conclusion is not strongly tied back to the sustainability constraints your objective implies. The final plan is actionable but less robust on the key dividend sustainability dimension.

— qwen3-max —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Uses your macro and presented fundamentals/technicals. However, it asserts “Foreign institutional activity remains strong (BlackRock, PIMCO recent buyers)”—naming specific funds—without evidence traceable to your broker tools in the output provided. If those fund-level flows were indeed in your dataset, this should have been explicitly grounded; otherwise, this is a weak point.
  - It also characterizes MSCI/free-float “limited impact” while citing BSSR’s ~8.8% free float. That interpretation is questionable; low free float typically amplifies index-flow sensitivity and liquidity-driven moves.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Organized and thorough on comparisons and technicals, but the two points above undermine interpretation quality.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Preferring ITMG is defensible on valuation/liquidity, but conclusions rely partly on questionable assertions (named institutional buyers; minimizing MSCI/free-float effects).

— gpt-oss-120b —

- Technical Accuracy:
  - Methodological error in scoring: allocates 1–2 points per item and totals “7/6” for BSSR while declaring the scale “out of 6.” This undermines the validity of the checklist.
  - Claims “MSCI announced an increase in free-float weighting for Indonesia effective early 2026.” No such policy detail was in your macro brief; unless you provided a separate tool output supporting this, it appears unfounded. This is a material accuracy issue.
- Analytical Quality:
  - Attempts a comprehensive comparison, but the scoring inconsistency and likely unfounded MSCI policy claim weaken the reasoning framework significantly.
- Correctness of Findings:
  - Recommending BSSR could be reasonable on fundamentals/dividends, but the justification is compromised by the methodological and factual problems above.

Summary

- With your clarification that granular figures came from verified tools, I have removed penalties for “hallucination” and judged the models on how well they used and interpreted those data.
- gpt-5-mini and gpt-5 stand out for correctly leveraging dividend sustainability (payout vs cash/FCF) and free-float/MSCI considerations, aligning recommendations and trade plans to your ≥10% objective and the RDPT alternative.
- gemini-2.5-flash is largely strong but should resolve the valuation inconsistency regarding ITMG.
- deepseek_v3_1 and kimi-k2-0905 are detailed but underweight the sustainability dimension in their final calls.
- qwen3-max includes questionable fund-naming and a weak interpretation of MSCI/free-float implications.
- gpt-oss-120b’s methodological scoring error and likely unfounded MSCI claim materially reduce trust in its findings.
