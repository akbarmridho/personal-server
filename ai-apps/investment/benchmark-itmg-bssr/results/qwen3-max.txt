### **Investment Recommendation**

**RECOMMENDATION: BUY ITMG**

**Investment Thesis:**
1. **Superior Financial Strength**: ITMG's net cash position of IDR 14.9 trillion provides exceptional downside protection and dividend sustainability
2. **Attractive Valuation**: Trading at 0.85x P/B with 15.28% dividend yield offers compelling risk-reward
3. **Quality Management**: Backed by Banpu Group (Thai multinational) with strong track record
4. **Coal Price Support**: Current HBA prices support near-term earnings recovery

**Entry Strategy:**
- **Entry Price Range**: IDR 21,400 - 22,500 (current price of IDR 22,725 is acceptable for partial position)
- **Position Sizing**: Allocate 70% to ITMG, 30% to BSSR if diversification desired
- **Holding Period**: 12-18 months to capture coal price recovery and valuation rerating

**Risk Management:**
- **Stop Loss**: IDR 20,500 (below 52-week low, representing 9.8% downside from current levels)
- **Take Profit Targets**: 
  - Target 1: IDR 26,000 (14.4% upside, 12-month price target)
  - Target 2: IDR 28,650 (26% upside, 52-week high retest)
- **Expected Return**: 15-20% annually (dividend + capital appreciation)

**Why Not BSSR?**
While BSSR shows strong accumulation and higher ROE, its higher P/B ratio (2.19x), lower absolute financial strength, and greater earnings volatility make it less suitable for achieving consistent 10%+ returns with adequate margin of safety.

**Final Decision:**
ITMG offers the optimal combination of safety (strong balance sheet), yield (15.28% dividend), and upside potential (valuation recovery) to meet your 10% annual return target with superior risk management compared to both BSSR and RDPT alternatives.
