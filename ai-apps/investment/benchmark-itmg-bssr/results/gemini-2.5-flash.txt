### Executive Summary

Based on fundamental strength, superior valuation metrics, lower debt, and a more robust short-term technical outlook supported by recent broker accumulation, **BSSR (PT Baramulti Suksessarana Tbk) is the better investment choice** right now. While ITMG offers better diversification potential (Energy Services & Downstream), its valuation is less compelling, and its financial performance is declining faster than BSSR's. BSSR's extremely low debt and high capital efficiency make its dividend capacity more resilient to coal price volatility.

**Recommendation**: **BUY BSSR.**

### 2. Detailed Ta Cuan Analysis

#### A. T - The Management (Qualitative + Ownership/Management Data)

1.  **ITMG**: As a subsidiary of Banpu Minerals (Singapore) and actively focused on ESG and energy diversification, ITMG demonstrates a strategic long-term view. Insider activity data (`get-stock-ownership`) is not provided, so the management score is neutral.
2.  **BSSR**: The company is an established player with solid operations. The absence of specific management data, like ITMG, makes GCG assessment difficult purely on provided data. However, its financial metrics (ultra-low DER and high ROE) indicate highly effective capital management.

#### B. A - Annual Report (Fundamental Performance & Dividend Sustainability)

| Checklist | ITMG (22,725) | BSSR (3,990) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ROE (>15%)** | ✅ 17.89% (Met: 1) | ✅ 34.04% (Met: 1) |
| **DER (<1.0x)** | ✅ 0.06x (Met: 2) | ✅ 0.01x (Met: 2) |
| **Net Profit Margin (>10%)** | ❌ 5.95% (Q2’25) | ✅ 17.40% (Q2’25) (Met: 3) |
| **Liquidity (Current Ratio >1.0x)** | ✅ 4.10x (Met: 3) | ✅ 2.05x (Met: 4) |

**Conclusion (BSSR Winner):** Both pass the basic solvency and ROE test. However, ITMG's recent sharp decline in Net Income Growth (-60.68% YoY Q2'25) and low Net Profit Margin (5.95%) raise concerns about its future dividend sustainability, even with a high historical yield. **BSSR has superior profitability and near-zero debt**, making its revenue stream (even a shrinking one) far more likely to be channeled into dividends.

#### C. C - Candle Stick Pattern (Using 1M Data, Price at 27 Oct 2025)

1.  **ITMG (Price 22,725)**: The candlestick patterns show recent **Bullish Engulfing** on October 20 and 23, suggesting reversal potential following a downtrend. The MACD has recently turned positive (+13.56) and crossed its signal line, indicating an emerging buy signal for the short term. However, the price is still below the 200-day SMA (23,366) and the 50-day SMA (22,477 is below the 200-day), suggesting a long-term bearish and medium-term neutral/sideways technical trend.
2.  **BSSR (Price 3,990)**: The chart shows a recent **Bullish Engulfing** on October 20, suggesting a rebound after falling to the **SMA50 (3,919)**. The MACD has swung strongly positive (+12.97) after being heavily negative, confirming a strong short-term momentum shift. The price is currently well below the SMA200 (4,087).

**Conclusion (BSSR Edge):** Both show short-term bullish reversal signals (Bullish Engulfing, MACD positive cross), but BSSR is currently showing stronger short-term momentum from its technical indicators.

#### D. U - Universe of Support & Resistance (Based on 3M Volume Profile & ZigZag)

1.  **ITMG**:
    *   **Support**: The heavy volume profile at **22,368 - 22,462** (46.7M volume) and **22,462 - 22,556** (37.5M volume) suggests a major short-term support zone around **22,350 - 22,550**.
    *   **Resistance**: Significant resistance exists in the range of **22,743 - 22,931** (27.4M-28.7M volume). The current price (22,725) is testing this resistance area.
2.  **BSSR**:
    *   **Support**: The strongest volume profile cluster is around **3,919 - 3,930** (21.3M volume). The price is currently just above this, indicating solid short-term support.
    *   **Resistance**: Major resistance is around **4,080 - 4,090** (SMA200 is 4,087).

**Conclusion (BSSR Winner):** BSSR is currently sitting just above a strong support cluster (3,919 - 3,930) and the SMA50. ITMG is stuck in a consolidation zone, immediately beneath heavy resistance.

#### E. A & N - Accumulation & Name of Stock Brokers (Bandarmology)

| Period | ITMG (22,725) | BSSR (3,990) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 Week** | **Accumulation** (Normal Acc: +5.28B net buy) | Distribution (Net Dist: -37M net sell by top 10) |
| **1 Month** | **Distribution** (Normal Dist: -10.45B net sell) | **Accumulation** (Big Acc: +2.47B net buy) |
| **3 Months**| **Distribution** (Normal Dist: -82.5B net sell) | **Distribution** (Net Dist: -1.26B net sell) |

**Conclusion (BSSR Edge):** The longer-term picture (3M) is bearish distribution for both, which is expected during a commodity downtrend. However, the last 1 month is crucial:
*   **ITMG**: Shows distribution (-10.45B). The one-week accumulation (+5.28B) is likely a technical bounce or brief foreign interest (BK, AK, KZ, YU are net buyers).
*   **BSSR**: Shows strong **Big Accumulation** (+2.47B) over the last month, particularly from foreign broker ZP (+6.13B). This confirms institutional interest in BSSR at its current price range and strongly supports the short-term technical recovery.

### Overall Macro & Sector Outlook

The market intelligence indicates an unexpected **short-term tailwind** for Indonesian coal prices, with the HBA (Benchmark Coal Price) rising to **US\$109.74 per ton** in mid-October 2025 due to a China winter demand spike and lower Indonesian national production. This short-term price strength will support the latest quarter's earnings for both companies.

However, the **long-term outlook remains cautious** (IEA projects a global plateau, analysts forecast price decline into 2026). This long-term risk emphasizes the need for companies with high cash flow, minimal debt, and superior operating margins—which favors BSSR.

### Investment Plan Details

**Recommended Stock to Buy**: **BSSR** (PT Baramulti Suksessarana Tbk)

BSSR's superior efficiency (34% ROE), minimal DER (0.01x), high margins (32% Gross Margin), and recent broker accumulation (ZP/foreign buyer) offer a higher margin of safety and greater potential for continued high dividends compared to the rapidly deteriorating margins and income of ITMG. BSSR offers a stronger risk-reward thesis given the negative long-term trend of coal.

#### Investment Parameters for BSSR (Current Price: 3,990)

| Parameter | Value (Rp) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Entry Price Range** | **3,900 – 4,000** | Buy at the current level or near the 1-month support cluster (3,919-3,930). |
| **Holding Period** | **6 – 12 Months** | Short-to-medium term to capitalize on the Q4'25 coal price spike and potentially capture the 2026 dividend payout. |
| **Take-Profit Target (T1)** | **4,400** (+10.27%) | Targeting the next significant peak or the upper end of its 52-week trading range. This meets your minimum 10% annual return target. |
| **Take-Profit Target (T2)**| **4,800 – 5,000** (+25-30%)| Targeting the 52-week high, should the HBA price strength persist into Q1 2026. |
| **Stop-Loss Level** | **3,700** (-7.2%) | A break below this level (below 52-week low of 3,770 and previous support) indicates a return to a bearish trend with significant broker distribution. |

#### Risk Factors

1.  **Commodity Price Reversal**: The current coal price spike is noted to be a "short-term demand event." If China's winter demand is met quickly or if global economic slowdown continues, coal prices will put downward pressure on both BSSR and ITMG's 2026 earnings.
2.  **Dividend Payout Ratio (BSSR)**: While current fundamentals are strong, BSSR's future dividend yield strictly depends on maintaining a high payout ratio against declining profits in a weak long-term coal environment.
3.  **MSCI Free Float Adjustment (General)**: If the pending MSCI adjustment involves changes in free-float calculations, it could increase volatility for Indonesian stocks, though the impact is hard to predict without further data.
