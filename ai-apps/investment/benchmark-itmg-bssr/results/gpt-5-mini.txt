Executive summary
- Both ITMG and BSSR currently offer dividend yields above your 10% target (ITMG ~15.3% TTM; BSSR ~11.5% TTM) and trade at very low P/E multiples (ITMG ~4.6–4.8x TTM; BSSR ~6.4x TTM).  
- For a dividend-focused investor seeking sustainable 10%+ returns with moderate risk, I prefer BSSR as the core holding (higher ROE, cleaner recent accumulation by brokers, payout ratio more conservative). Use ITMG as a yield booster / satellite position (very strong balance sheet and much higher cash buffer but recent payout ratio spike and some 1-month distribution). Suggested split: BSSR 60% / ITMG 40%. Hold 1–3 years, with staged entries and stops. See details and trade plan below.

Ta Cuan checklist (quick)
- ITMG: 4/6 met (Management good & strategic owner, Fundamentals strong balance sheet & ROE >15%, Candlestick/technical neutral-to-slight-bullish, Support near current price, Bandarmology mixed — recent 1m shows distribution, Valuation attractive) → BUY (satellite) with caution on dividend sustainability.
- BSSR: 5/6 met (Management stable, Fundamentals strong profitability & low debt, Technical bullish/accumulation, Price near support, Bandarmology shows accumulation over 1w–1m, Valuation attractive) → BUY (core).

Detailed analysis

1) Fundamental (numbers from latest available data)
- ITMG (price 22,725 IDR)
  - P/E (TTM) ≈ 4.6–4.8x; Forward P/E ≈ 6.4x. Earnings yield ≈ 21% (TTM).
  - Dividend yield (TTM) ≈ 15.3%. Most recent TTM payout ratio reported ~131% (inflated by large dividends in the period), earlier-year payout ratios ~66% (2024). Dividend history shows frequent/large payouts.
  - Profitability: ROE (TTM) ≈ 17.9%, ROA ≈ 14.0% — above your Ta Cuan thresholds.
  - Solvency & cash: Very strong — Debt/equity ≈ 0.06; Net cash position (quarter) ~ (–14,941 B) i.e., large net cash; Cash (quarter) ~16,883 B; Free cash flow (TTM) strong (~6,163 B). Interest coverage very high.
  - Growth: Recent revenue and profit YoY have weakened (quarterly revenue & net income down vs prior year), reflecting softer volumes / prices earlier in 2025.
  - Interpretation: Excellent balance sheet and cash generation — can support dividends in weak periods, but the very high TTM payout ratio indicates some dividends were special/one-offs; monitor next AGM/dividend guidance.

- BSSR (price 3,990 IDR)
  - P/E (TTM) ≈ 6.4x. Earnings yield ≈ 15.5% (TTM).
  - Dividend yield (TTM) ≈ 11.5% with payout ratio ~73% (TTM) — more conservative and likely more repeatable than ITMG’s TTM payout.
  - Profitability: ROE (TTM) ≈ 34.0%, ROA ≈ 23.8% — very strong.
  - Solvency & cash: Extremely low leverage — Debt/equity ≈ 0.01; Net cash position ~ (–977 B); free cash flow positive (~1,423 B TTM). Interest coverage extremely high.
  - Growth: Revenues and profits also down QoQ/YoY in recent quarters but margins remain healthy (net margin ~17% recent quarter).
  - Interpretation: Very efficient, high-return business with a dividend payout ratio that is high but in a range that has been historically sustainable when coal pricing supports earnings.

Conclusion (fundamental): Both companies are financially healthy and deliver attractive yields. BSSR has superior return-on-capital metrics and a more conservative payout ratio (higher probability of dividend sustainability); ITMG offers higher yield and a huge cash buffer that supports dividends but TTM payout spikes look partly special.

2) Technical (short-term / trend)
- ITMG
  - Current price ~22,725; SMA50 ≈ 22,478 (close), SMA200 ≈ 23,366 (price below 200 SMA → longer-term down bias). Recent MACD histogram turned positive and multiple bullish engulfing candles in mid-late Oct — short-term recovery signs. ADX very low (~12) → weak trend. Volume profile shows heavy trading around 22k–23k (support zone).
  - Technical read: trading near short-term support (~22,000–22,500). Short-term bullish signals exist but longer-term trend still below 200-SMA.

- BSSR
  - Current price ~3,990; SMA50 ≈ 3,919 (price above), SMA200 ≈ 4,087 (price slightly below long-term), ADX ≈ 20–24 (moderate trend), recent MACD has turned positive; candlestick recently bullish. Volume profile shows strong activity around 3,880–3,960 (support).
  - Technical read: price is near a support area and shows accumulation / stronger positive momentum than ITMG in the last 1–2 weeks.

3) Bandarmology / broker activity / ownership
- ITMG
  - Free float ≈ 34.7% (meaning foreign/index flows have room but not extremely tight). Major shareholder: Banpu Minerals (Singapore) ~65% — strategic/controlling owner.
  - Broker detector: mixed — recent 1-week shows some small accumulations but 1-month broker summary showed net distribution (Normal Dist) — indicates some selling pressure in the last month (some large local brokers selling). Foreign institutional flows show some switching.
  - Implication: dividend support from parent + strong cash, but watch short-term broker selling and potential foreign fund rotations.

- BSSR
  - Free float ≈ 8.8% (very low). Major shareholders include PT Wahana Sentosa (~50%), Tata Power and GS Energy holdings — strategic/industry shareholders.
  - Broker detector: clear accumulation in 1-week and especially in 1-month windows (descriptions show Big Acc / Normal Acc depending period), several foreign brokers buying in recent weeks. Low free float + visible accumulation by brokers suggests controlled accumulation and potential sharp moves on demand.
  - Implication: recent accumulation signal is positive for short-medium term upside, but low free-float increases volatility and makes the stock sensitive to any foreign/institutional flows or MSCI adjustments.

4) Valuation & dividend sustainability (for a 10% target)
- ITMG: dividend yield ~15% TTM — exceeds your 10% target comfortably. But check sustainability: company has huge cash and strong FCF so dividends can be paid even if earnings drop; historical payout ratios vary (some years >100% due to special dividends). If dividends return to a normalized payout (say 50–70%) and earnings are pressured by lower coal pricing, yield could fall. Still, balance-sheet cushion is strong.
- BSSR: dividend yield ~11.5% TTM with payout ratio ~73% — this is closer to a sustainable ordinary dividend (not heavily reliant on one-offs) as long as coal prices and volumes don’t collapse. For a 1–3 year hold, expected return from dividends alone meets your 10% threshold.

5) Business & industry outlook (macro / coal environment)
- Short-term (Oct 2025): Indonesian HBA (reference coal price) and regional thermal coal prices have been rising in Oct 2025 (HBA for high-cal 6,322 GAR ≈ US$109.7/ton for 2nd half Oct) — driven by China seasonal demand/inventory drawdown and tighter regional supply. This is a positive tailwind for earnings and dividends in the coming quarters.
- Medium-term: many forecasters (IEA and sector analysts) expect structural plateauing or gradual decline in global coal demand over 2025–2026, with Asian demand (China/India) remaining the main support. Indonesia’s 9-month 2025 production was lower YoY — that supports price spikes but also creates volatility.
- Company-level:
  - ITMG: larger producer, integrated operations and power/energy service businesses; parent Banpu provides strategic backing and flexibility (including diversification plans).
  - BSSR: asset-light/efficient operation with high ROE; exposure concentrated but well-run.
- Regulatory & transition risk: energy transition and future regulations (import/export rules, domestic market obligations, stricter ESG norms) are longer-term risks for both.

6) MSCI / free-float & market sentiment
- MSCI-like free-float adjustments matter: BSSR’s low free-float (~8.8%) increases vulnerability to index reweighting and concentrated flows (can amplify moves on foreign selling or buying). ITMG’s higher free-float (~34.7%) reduces that mechanical volatility risk. If an MSCI rebalancing reduces allocations to Indonesian small free-float names, BSSR could see outsized flows; conversely, it benefits faster on concentrated buying.

Sector comparison (relative)
- Profitability: BSSR > ITMG (ROE 34% vs 18%; ROA 24% vs 14%).  
- Balance sheet / liquidity: ITMG has much bigger cash pile and stronger absolute liquidity (bigger market cap but huge net cash) — better defensive profile.  
- Dividend yield: ITMG > BSSR (15.3% vs 11.5%), but ITMG TTM payout ratio elevated (monitor sustainability).  
- Market action: BSSR shows clearer bandarmology accumulation and short-term positive technicals; ITMG shows mixed broker flows (1-month net distribution) though longer-term fundamentals are very solid.

Recommendation & investment plan
- Objective reminder: you need minimum 10% annual return. Both names currently meet that via dividend yield alone (if dividends are paid as in TTM).
- My recommendation: Buy BSSR as the core position (60%) and ITMG as a satellite (40%). Rationale:
  - BSSR: stronger operating returns, broker accumulation, payout ratio in a range that looks repeatable, technicals supportive — better for dividend sustainability + upside.
  - ITMG: stronger balance sheet (big net cash), higher absolute yield — good if you want higher income and a margin-of-safety; limit position size because recent payout ratio spike reflects special distributions and there was some 1m distribution by brokers.

Entry / sizing & execution
- Use tranche buying (scale in) to reduce execution/timing risk.
- ITMG entry range: 22,000 – 22,900 IDR (current ~22,725). Main support zone ~22,000–22,500 according to volume profile & recent lows. Buy in 3 tranches: 40% at 22,700–22,900; 40% at 22,200–22,700; 20% at 21,600–22,200 (if price dips).
- BSSR entry range: 3,770 – 4,050 IDR (current 3,990). Support near 3,770–3,900. Buy in 3 tranches: 40% at 3,900–4,050; 40% at 3,820–3,900; 20% at 3,600–3,820.

Stop-loss (two-tier)
- Because you are dividend-focused, prefer wider stop bands to avoid being stopped by ordinary volatility; use both an initial protective stop and a hard stop:
  - ITMG: protective stop 18,200 IDR (~20% below current), hard stop 16,500 IDR (~27% below). If dividend is cut materially or balance-sheet changes, exit.
  - BSSR: protective stop 3,200 IDR (~20% below current), hard stop 2,900 IDR (~27% below). Because free-float is low, allow wider room for volatility.
- Option: if you prefer tighter risk control, use 15% protective stops instead — but be aware you may be stopped on normal swings.

Take-profit targets and holding period
- Holding period: 1–3 years (to capture dividends and a potential rerating if coal tailwinds persist).
- Partial take-profit strategy (sell in layers):
  - ITMG:
    - TP1 (take 30–50% profit): 27,300 IDR (~+20% from current) — collect some gains if price rallies and yield compresses.  
    - TP2 (take remainder or re-evaluate): 34,000 IDR (~+50%) — longer-term upside if coal prices and earnings re-rate.
  - BSSR:
    - TP1: 4,788 IDR (~+20%).  
    - TP2: 5,580–5,600 IDR (~+40%–+40–40+), re-evaluate at that point.
- Dividend capture: continue holding through dividend dates (watch ex-dates) if the dividend policy remains intact. Reinvest or rebalance after dividend payment.

What could go wrong (key risks)
- Coal price collapse or prolonged weak demand (China/India) → materially lower earnings/dividend cuts. This is the main risk for both.
- Dividend cut or special dividend normalization: ITMG’s TTM payout >100% suggests part of the yield may be from special distributions; a reversion to normalized payout will reduce yield.
- MSCI/index / foreign flows: BSSR’s very low free float makes it vulnerable to volatile foreign flows on index rebalances or sudden net foreign selling; can cause sharp price drops.
- Regulatory risk: export rules, domestic market obligations, or fiscal changes in Indonesia can change pricing or margins.
- Operational risk: mine accidents, higher strip ratios, logistics disruptions.
- Macro: USD/IDR swings, higher global rates (raise cost of capital), or global recession reducing power demand.

Decision rule vs RDPT (your alternative)
- If you require guaranteed-ish net returns ≥10% with much lower equity risk, RDPT (9–10%) is a close alternative. But both stocks currently offer >10% in expected annual return from dividends alone — if you accept equity price volatility and dividend risk, the stocks offer upside above RDPT.
- If you prefer minimal price volatility and guarantee of capital preservation with stable yield, choose RDPT. If you accept market risk for higher yield and potential capital gains, go with the BSSR/ITMG mix above.

Actionable checklist (short)
- Place limit orders in tranches within the ranges above (BSSR core 60%, ITMG 40%).  
- Set protective stops at ~20% below entry (hard stops ~25–30% if you want to give room).  
- Monitor next quarterly results / AGM dividend announcements and updated guidance on coal production/pricing.  
- Watch MSCI/index announcements and foreign broker flows (BSSR especially).
