- **Total Return Expectation**: 15-18% including dividends

## **Macroeconomic Considerations**

**Market Context:**
- **IHSG Performance**: Down 1.87% today, showing market weakness
- **Coal Sector**: Outperforming with +34.45% annual growth
- **Global Factors**: China winter demand supporting coal prices
- **Regulatory**: Indonesia maintaining export dominance

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Coal Price Volatility**: Primary risk for both companies
2. **Energy Transition**: Long-term structural decline in coal demand
3. **Regulatory Changes**: Potential government policy shifts
4. **Currency Risk**: Rupiah fluctuations affecting export revenues

## **Final Recommendation**

**Given your 10% minimum return requirement, ITMG is clearly the superior choice** because:

1. **Current dividend yield of 15.28% already exceeds your target**
2. **Strong margin of safety with PER of 4.75x**
3. **Better liquidity and institutional support**
4. **More sustainable dividend payout ratio**

The expected total return for ITMG (20-25%) significantly exceeds both your minimum requirement and the 9-10% offered by RDPT, while providing a reasonable risk profile for a coal sector investment.

**BSSR**, while offering higher profitability metrics, carries greater risk due to its smaller size, lower liquidity, and current technical positioning near resistance levels.
