1) Executive Summary
- Both ITMG and BSSR meet a dividend-investing objective with double-digit TTM yields and solid balance sheets. Near-term coal pricing (per the brief you provided for Oct-2025) has a supportive setup from tighter supply and stronger Asia demand, but the medium-term still faces a plateau/gradual decline risk.
- If you prioritize liquidity, valuation cushion, and index-flow resilience, ITMG is the better core holding. If you want a higher-ROE name with strong recent accumulation but accept lower free float and higher PBV, add BSSR as a satellite.
- Suggested allocation today: ITMG 60–70%, BSSR 30–40%.

Business/industry outlook (context)
- Coal market (per the brief you provided for Oct-2025):
  - H2 Oct HBA rose to ~US$109.7 for 6,322 GAR; low-rank HBA also up. Drivers: tighter regional supply, China/India seasonal demand, China inventory drawdown and winter prep.
  - Indonesia Jan–Sep 2025 production reportedly lower YoY; tightness supportive near term.
  - Medium-term: IEA projects plateau; renewables transition caps upside; pricing spikes likely episodic.
- Company positioning:
  - ITMG: diversified into services/downstream; large, liquid, global parent (Banpu) governance; ample net cash to keep dividend policy consistent even in softer cycles.
  - BSSR: efficient operator with very high ROE. But small free float (8.77%) and higher PBV make it more sensitive to flow/liquidity.

Technical (daily/near-term)
- IHSG context: Index recently weak (close -1.87% w/w). Stock entries should be staged.
- ITMG:
  - Price vs MAs: above SMA50 (~22,478), below SMA200 (~23,366) → sideways/weak downtrend.
  - Patterns: Bullish Engulfing (23 Oct), then Shooting Star (27 Oct) → mixed signals; ADX low (trend not strong).
  - S/R: Support 22,300–22,700 (thick volume nodes 22,55x–22,9xx); Resistance 23,000–23,600 then 26,700 (PBV 1.0 ≈ 26,741).
- BSSR:
  - Price vs MAs: above SMA50 (3,919), below SMA200 (4,087) → recovery attempt.
  - Patterns: Bullish Engulfing (20 Oct); MACD turned positive; OBV improving.
  - S/R: Support 3,880–3,930; Resistance 4,010–4,040 then 4,300/4,600–4,760 (52W High).

Bandarmology (broker activity)
- ITMG:
  - 1d: Neutral-to-Acc; foreign/state (ZP, CC, BK) buying; locals BB/XC selling.
  - 1w: Accumulation (foreign BK, AK, KZ; state CC) → supportive.
  - 1m: Distribution overall, but weekly tilt improving. Net effect: accumulation is returning on dips.
- BSSR:
  - 1d: Big Acc (ZP, YP foreign net buy); locals XL/PD/XC on sell side.
  - 1w: Mixed (headline Dist), but still meaningful buys from foreign/government; average shows small-to-normal Acc.
  - 1m: Big Acc (ZP heavy). Net effect: stronger accumulation profile than ITMG.

Valuation and expected return
- ITMG: Deep value (PBV <1, EV/EBITDA ~1.2x) with net cash and historically generous dividends. Even if earnings normalize, a 60–70% payout can still deliver ~10–12% yield at current price; any re-rate toward PBV 1.0 implies ~17–18% price upside. Total return potential 15–30% over 12 months (dividend + re-rate), subject to coal price path.
- BSSR: Cheap on PER, rich on PBV (2.19x) given very high ROE. Dividend likely ~10–12% at current run-rate; technical and accumulation may support a move to 4,300–4,600 (+8–15%). Total return potential ~20% including dividends if the breakout sustains, but with higher liquidity/flow risk.

4) Macroeconomic considerations

- Indonesia/global markets
  - IHSG momentum is soft; staged entries are prudent.
  - Watch BI policy rate, IDR volatility, and global risk sentiment; these affect foreign flow into high-dividend cyclicals.
- Energy/coal dynamics (from your Oct-2025 brief)
  - Near-term tailwinds: China winter demand, inventory drawdown, India restocking, Indonesia output softness → supportive HBA and ASP in Q4.
  - Medium-term: coal demand plateau as renewables grow; pricing strength likely episodic. Companies with low cost, net cash, and disciplined capex (both ITMG, BSSR) better positioned to keep dividends.
- MSCI free float adjustment risk
  - Free float matters for index weights and foreign flows. ITMG free float ~34.7% (healthier; more investable). BSSR free float ~8.8% (low) → potential constraints to index inclusion/weight and larger price impact from any flow changes around review dates. This argues for overweighting ITMG for core exposure.

5) Sector comparison (peers context)
- Relative to Indonesia coal peers, ITMG trades at lower PBV and EV/EBITDA than most large caps, offering valuation cushion and liquidity. BSSR posts superior ROE but with higher PBV and much lower free float. YTD price returns for both are around -10% to -15%, in line with many miners; dividends remain the key return driver.

6) Recommendation and Investment Plan

Recommended buy: Both, with tilt to ITMG
- Allocation: ITMG 60–70%, BSSR 30–40%
- Rationale:
  - ITMG: deeper value, stronger liquidity, net cash, payout track record → better core for 10%+ target.
  - BSSR: higher ROE and stronger recent accumulation → satellite for added upside; accept free float/liquidity risk.

Entry price
- ITMG: 22,300–22,700 (add on weakness to 21,800–22,000)
- BSSR: 3,880–3,990 (add near 3,820–3,860)

Holding period
- 6–12 months, ideally over the next dividend cycle(s) (interim/final around Sep–Nov and Apr–May historically), reassess with coal/HBA trend and Q4–Q1 results.

Stop-loss
- ITMG: 21,250 (below 52W low 21,400), or 6–7% from entry
- BSSR: 3,780 (below 52W low 3,770), or ~5% from entry
  - If using a portfolio stop, consider -10% blended.

Take-profit targets
- ITMG: TP1 23,900–24,200; TP2 26,500–26,800 (PBV ~1.0); trail thereafter toward 28,500 if coal strength persists.
- BSSR: TP1 4,200; TP2 4,600–4,760; trail above 4,300 on strong volume.

7) Risks
- Coal price reversal after seasonal spike; medium-term demand plateau caps ASP and dividends.
- Policy/regulatory (royalties, domestic market obligations).
- FX and global risk-off weighing on IHSG and foreign flows.
- MSCI/free float flows: BSSR’s low free float increases gap/volatility risk; ITMG more resilient but still exposed to broader rebalancing.
- Operational (weather, logistics, production mix).

Bottom line
- For your 10% minimum annual return objective with controlled risk, prioritize ITMG as the core (valuation cushion + dividend visibility) and complement with BSSR for higher-ROE upside given recent accumulation. Stage entries near today’s supports, respect stops, and let dividends anchor returns while you opportunistically take profit into resistance.
